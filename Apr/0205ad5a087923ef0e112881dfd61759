Teenage sprinter Gift Leotlela made another statement, building on his terrific form ahead of the SA Junior and Youth Championships in Cape Town next week, by equalling his own national Under-20 record in the 100m dash. Leotlela charged to victory in 10.12 seconds at the second and final leg of the Varsity Athletics Series held at Tuks Stadium in Tshwane, matching the junior mark he had set on the same track at the Gauteng North Provincial Championships two weeks earlier. We take the opportunity to congratulate this young man who is proving to be an interesting athlete, full of ambition and is focussed. He is clearly showing his hand as a prospect, but will have to work harder to improve of his current performance. Together with his coaching staff, we believe they can do it, said Aleck Skhosana, the President of Athletics South Africa His training partner Clarence Munyai was also on fire, storming to a convincing win in the 200m sprint in 20.25 secs, crossing the line 0.15 outside his own SA Junior record. Letitia Janse van Vuuren also came close to bettering her national mark in the Women s Hammer Throw. The 20-year-old athlete produced a 62.37m heave to win her specialist discipline, less than two metres short of the 63.82m SA record she set in Sasolburg on Tuesday.
