EFF national spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi on Monday dismissed a report by The Sowetan newspaper that its FNB bank account in Braamfontein had been frozen by the Labour Court in Johannesburg after the party unfairly dismissed a former researcher in the Limpopo legislature. Ndlozi took to Twitter to rubbish the report, saying the account is not and has never been frozen. The order was challenged and never went into any function. We can pay anyone from that account [sic] . The EFF account is NOT &amp; has NEVER been frozen. The order was challenged &amp; never went into any function. We can pay anyone from that Account https://t.co/cU7HrsmV6u &mdash; IG: @MbuyiseniNdlozi (@MbuyiseniNdlozi) April 24, 2017 The paper reported that Advocate Fenya Maabane challenged his dismissal at the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA), which ruled that his removal was unfair both procedurally and substantively . He was reportedly fired from his job on allegations of absenteeism and failure to attend to official duties. The CCMA ordered that Maabane be paid a salary equivalent to seven months pay, amounting to more than R400 000. The party was given until February 2016 to settle the amount but failed to do so. Maabane took the matter to court, which ordered that the EFF s assets be attached at its offices in Limpopo, the report stated. However, the value of the assets of the EFF s Polokwane offices were found to be less than their stipulated amount by a court sheriff. Maabane s lawyers applied to the court to attach the party s head office assets in Braamfontein, Johannesburg. The EFF&#8217;s FNB bank account in Braamfontein was also attached on February 21.
