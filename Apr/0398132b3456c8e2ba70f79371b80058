The South African Music Awards 23 (Samas) held its nomination announcement ceremony at the Destiny Exclusive Hotel in Kempton Park on Thursday night and rapper Nasty C led the pack with six nominations. He was nominated for Best Newcomer of the Year, Best Male Artist of the Year, Best Album of the Year and Best Rap Album, while his videos Don t Do It and Good Girls received Best Music Video of the Year nominations. However, Twitter thought the Samas had robbed the poor rapper of another nomination, and they are not taking any chances, in hopes of avoiding the Babes Wodumo saga at the Metros earlier this year. According to Twitter, Nasty C&#8217;s debut album, Bad Hair Extensions (the Samas spelled it as &#8216;Extentions&#8217;, which is wrong by the way), has now been nominated in the Female Artist of the Year category, along with Babes Wodumo and Kelly Khumalo, to name a few. According to Twitter, Mabala Noise is not about to lose out on any award at the Samas, so adding Nasty C was just a way of fighting for its own.

Check out his tweet below: I can explain.. pic.twitter.com/MOXDIx1qys &mdash; Nasty_C (@Nasty_CSA) April 21, 2017 Now it all makes sense. But of course, all this was photoshopped. The Samas will be held at the Sun City Superbowl on May 27. Also read: Nasty C, Kwesta lead Sama 2017 nominations
