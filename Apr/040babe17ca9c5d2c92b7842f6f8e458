Royal Bafokeng Platinum (RBPlat) on Wednesday pointed to increased production volumes and labour cost related inflation as cash operating costs for three months to March 31 increased by 12.2% to R701 million. RBPlat said cash operating unit cost per tonne milled and 4E ounce were 6.8% and 7.2% higher for the quarter than the comparative 2016 period at R1,227 per tonne milled and R10,823 per 4E ounce respectively. A key operational focus for the business is to improve the fixed/variable cost ratio of our operations to target below consumer price index (CPI) unit increases for the year. As such, the JSE-listed, mid-tier platinum group metals producer has initiated a formal review process of the entire business to identify opportunities and develop a detailed strategy to implement the changes required with a progress report expected around August in the interim results. RBPlat said capital expenditure ended 56.6% higher at R370.6 million compared with the first quarter of 2016. Expansion capital expenditure increased by 87.5% to R346.1 million in line with mining and construction activities geared towards achieving the 150,000 tonnes per month ramp-up at Styldrift. Capital expenditure for the quarter amounted to R346.0 million bringing total expenditure on the project to R6.80 billion. RBPlats said total tonnes delivered to concentrators increased by 17.1% to 721,000 tonnes. Bafokeng Rasimone Platinum Mine contributed 597,000 tonnes and Styldrift 124,000 tonnes, representing a 7.8% and 100% increase from the operations respectively.
