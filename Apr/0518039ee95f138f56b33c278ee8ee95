Phew, that was close! The Lions scraped to a narrow 24-21 over a quality Jaguares outfit in Johannesburg on Friday evening. After a high of last week&#8217;s superb win at Newlands, this was a timely reality check for coach Johan Ackermann and his troops. Who was the star in this match? Lions blindsider Ruan Ackermann eventually had a storming game, making 14 tackles, carrying well and scoring the match-winning try. Jaguares captain and hooker Augustin Creevy was typically shrewd and influential but it was lock Guido Petti that stole the show. His work-rate was simply immense and his support play excellent. Key themes and events The old saying goes that a champion team is one that wins matches it probably didn&#8217;t deserve to. It definitely was the case for the Lions, who were plagued by poor handling, execution and decision-making. Despite their reputation for being an attacking side, the Lions will have to re-look at their attacking structure. Two of their tries &#8211; from the centres Harold Vorster and Lionel Mapoe &#8211; were down to individual brilliance. Only Ruan Ackermann&#8217;s clincher was down to good teamplay. Flyhalf Elton Jantjies also needs to manage his game better, there were far too many needless &#8220;cute&#8221; kicks. After two difficult weeks, the Jaguares finally showed they are a Test-quality team again. There was nice verve to their attacking play, they defended well and were nuisances at the breakdown. But there&#8217;s a familiar downside to their play: discipline. The Jaguares again conceded a substantial 12 penalties, some of them truly preventable. They won&#8217;t make meaningful progress if they can&#8217;t cut down on their indiscretions. The Lions&#8217; game-plan is dependent on quick ball from the rucks. They&#8217;ll need to work on how to deal with disruptions, like the Jaguares provided. Point scorers Lions &#8211; Tries: Harold Vorster, Lionel Mapoe, Ruan Ackermann.
