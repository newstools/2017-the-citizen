Following her resignation from Metro FM on Monday, Bonang Matheba has rubbished claims that she left because she did not want to work with Lerato Kganyago, who Twitter has been calling &#8220;Bonang-lite&#8221;. &#8220;After three years of making magic on the Front Row, I can confirm that I have officially stepped down as the host of the show. &#8220;I will miss my Metro FM family dearly, as they say all good things do come to an end&#8230;.Looking forward to the next chapter of my radio life. &#8220;My heart is broken. I was told about the changes to my show an hour before going on air today,&#8221; she tweeted yesterday, causing a storm among fans who were not happy about the news. &#8230;.my heart is broken. I was told about the changes to my show an hour before going on air today&#8230; &mdash; Bonang B* Matheba (@bonang_m) April 3, 2017 But some of her followers on Twitter have been saying Bonang resigned because she did not want to work with Kganyago, who she apparently does not get along with. &#8220;Why is that heart breaking? It was not a bad change. You resigned because you don&#8217;t want to work with Lerato,&#8221; said one, who was never ready for Bonang&#8217;s response. &#8220;You&#8217;re an idiot,&#8221; Bonang responded, with a sarcastic heart emoji. Daily Sun has reported that Metro FM had apparently been trying to meet with Bonang since last week to try and sort out differences between the two presenters. Bonang allegedly avoided the meetings and threatened the station, thinking they would change their mind and not pair her up with Lerato. She apparently threw a tantrum after being told she would be working with Lerato and handed in her resignation after her show. Bonang has joined a list of presenters who have recently left the station allegedly due to the reshuffle. Glen Lewis left last week, followed by his former co-presenter Unathi Msengana, who allegedly left because she did not want to work with Khanyi Mbau.
