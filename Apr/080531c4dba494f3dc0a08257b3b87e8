One man died, and another was critically injured, during an attempted robbery in Primrose on Thursday, ER24 said. ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring said when paramedics arrived at the residence, located on Coral Road, they found one man lying in the road while another lay in the driveway, both men were believed to be in their 20s . Meiring said paramedics assessed the men and found that one had sustained numerous gunshot wounds and showed no signs of life, and he was declared dead on the scene. The other man was in a critical condition, having sustained numerous gunshot wounds. Paramedics treated the man and provided him with advanced life support interventions. Once treated he was transported to a nearby hospital for further treatment, said Meiring. It is understood that several armed men had entered the property. The homeowner then apparently opened fire on the men. Authorities were on the scene for further investigations.
