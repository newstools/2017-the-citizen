Presenter and model Minenhle Dlamini has found herself on the wrong side of Twitter after a tweet that offended many. On Saturday morning, Minnie tweeted: &#8220;While people are coming back from the club I&#8217;m in studio,&#8221; which left many thinking she was telling them both how to live their lives and boasting that she was somehow better than them. These were some of the responses she got: @MinnieDlamini @MorningLiveSABC let them be..work hard &amp; play hard..its nt a crime to go clubbing right.. &mdash; Thembinkosi Matipira (@thembimatipira) April 1, 2017 @MinnieDlamini @MorningLiveSABC pic.twitter.com/YY0NFTCPn9 &mdash; Karabo.

She has, however, hit back at the critics, saying they have &#8220;serious self issues&#8221; for misinterpreting her tweet. &#8220;Nina enicabanga ukuthi ngiyachoma (Those of you who think I&#8217;m being shady) that I&#8217;m working while people have fun have serious self issues! It&#8217;s not fun seeing my people party without me,&#8221; she said. She further told them that all that matters is for everyone to live their best life. &#8220;Anyway, have a lovely day guys, work or play.&#8221; Also read: WATCH: Minnie tells us how her bae proposed
