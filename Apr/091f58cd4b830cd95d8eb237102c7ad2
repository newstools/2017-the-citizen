Taking to Twitter, the outspoken activist took a jab at DJ Zinhle and her boyfriend, who has been languishing in prison since the weekend. Wooooooo is dj zinhle gonna be doing weekend visits at Leeuwkop? &mdash; Imbongikazi yeSizwe (@ntsikimazwai) April 10, 2017 Zinhle has kept quiet about news of Naidoo&#8217;s arrest, though Drum Magazine has reported that she and her friend, Metro FM presenter Lerato Kganyago, tried to visit him on Saturday night, the day of the arrest. Apparently, Naidoo convinced his victims by showing them pictures of himself next to a flashy Audi R8 and producing bank statements of how much money he was making. Two sisters told Sunday World they had taken their parents pension money and invested R1 million with Naidoo, believing they would receive a profit or return of 50%. Brendon convinced us that, from investing our R1 million, we will make R500 000 in profit. We took our parents pension money and gave it to him, only to find out that he is a scamster, said one sister.
