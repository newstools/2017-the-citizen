We all know rugby is a physical game. But what happened to French referee Benjamin Casty simply, to paraphrase a cliche, wasn&#8217;t rugby. Casty, whose brother Remi is a reasonably well-known rugby league player, was knocked out cold by a player during a semifinal of France&#8217;s rugby league junior cup between Saint-Esteve and Toulouse. The most disgraceful thing I have ever seen on a rugby field. You won&#39;t be needing boots again for life that is mate. Life ban Booom! pic.twitter.com/xNQ0SEplwc &mdash; Allan Donald (@AllanDonald33) April 28, 2017 The unidentified Saint-Esteve had just been sin binned for a professional foul when he walked up to Casty and hit him with a nasty right hook. He thew punches at some opposition players too, who tried to calm him down. The player clearly has a problem with Christian Cozza, president of Saint-Esteve, confirming that he had already served a four-match ban earlier in the season. Cozza was so embarrassed by the player&#8217;s conduct that he&#8217;s subsequently resigned from his post. Casty was taken to a nearby hospital and apparently managed to avoid a broken jaw.
