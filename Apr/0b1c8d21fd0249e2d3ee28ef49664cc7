Gujarati Network South Africa members have been urged to boycott a religious event reportedly being hosted by the controversial Gupta family this weekend near their Saxonwold compound. The event is set to take place at the military museum in Saxonwold from April 16 and will run for eight days. The family will apparently be sponsoring entertainment, food and transportation for hundreds of people for the duration of the event. The Gupta family has been mired in controversy over the past few years, most recently with their implication in former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela s state capture report. The family is accused of wielding power over President Jacob Zuma and influencing Cabinet appointments and dismissals. According to EWN, the Gujarati Network urged its members to boycott the upcoming event, saying they did not wish to be associated with the conduct of the family. Community members have also spoken out against the family, saying they did not wish to be associated with them. Responding to the calls for a boycott was a lawyer for the family, Gert van der Merwe, who said he was aware of the planned boycott by some people and that it was unfortunate that there were objections to the family event. He also said it was unfortunate that some people would opt to stoop so low as to attack one&#8217;s religious beliefs and the right to express one&#8217;s religion.
