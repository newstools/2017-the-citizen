South African Police Service (SAPS) detectives are working around the clock combing for clues following an armed robbery in Athlone in Cape Town on Saturday, Western Cape police said. Two SBV cash-in-transit guards came under fire from five unknown suspects and an undisclosed amount of cash was taken on the corner of Klipfontein and Carnie roads, Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said on Sunday. One security guard was fatally wounded and another seriously wounded during the shoot-out. SBV Services had offered a R1 million reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the perpetrators, Rwexana said. Anyone with information was urged to contact the SAPS on 08600-10111 or the investigating officer Constable Dricus Groenewaldt on 084-515-745.
