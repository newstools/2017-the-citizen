Brendon Naidoo, a self-proclaimed businessman, is currently in a holding cell and is set to appear in the Alexandra Magistrate&#8217;s Court tomorrow on several charges of fraud. He was arrested by Gauteng police yesterday, according to Sunday World. He allegedly ran a foreign exchange trading scheme in which people invested millions individually. One person claimed Naidoo told him he represented a large financial firm while another said he had given him R2.5 million and had not seen a return on the cash. The cases go back to at least 2014, with one businessman, Thapelo Tshepe, saying he transferred R3 million into Naidoo s account. He admitted to Sunday World that he also recruited other people, many of them retired teachers, to give their money to Naidoo, thinking he was helping them. Apparently, Naidoo convinced his victims by showing them pictures of himself next to a flashy Audi R8 and producing bank statements of how much money he was making. Two sisters told Sunday World they had taken their parents&#8217; pension money and invested R1 million with Naidoo, believing they would receive a profit or return of 50 percent. &#8220;Brendon convinced us that, from investing our R1 million, we will make R500 000 in profit. We took our parents&#8217; pension money and gave it to him, only to find out that he is a scamster,&#8221; said one sister. Since news broke of Naidoo&#8217;s fraudulent scheme, DJ Zinhle has shown her support for her beau, going on Instagram to say she was happy with him.
