A nine-year-old Mamelodi boy was allegedly beaten up by a neighbour for throwing stones at his car in Pretoria. The boy s aunt Miranda Tshabalala said the boy was taken to the clinic around 23:30pm on Sunday, Rekord East reported. The boy accidentally hit his neighbour s VW Jetta with a stone while playing in the street with other children. I don&#8217;t understand why would he beat my nephew like that because there was not even a scratch or dent on that man s car. Tshabalala said the boy seemed traumatised by the ordeal. She said an assault docket has been opened at the Mamelodi police station. &#8211; Caxton News Service For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter .
