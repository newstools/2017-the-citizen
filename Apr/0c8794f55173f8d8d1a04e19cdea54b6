Eskom s board has welcomed the decision by Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown to reject its proposed pension payout of R30 million to its former CEO, Brian Molefe. The board s spokesperson Khulani Qoma on Monday said it would talk to Molefe and report back to Brown with a better proposal in a few days. Qoma said the board has been engaging with the minister to discuss the controversial payout that was set to be given to Molefe despite him only serving 18 months at the helm of the parastatal. At the weekend, Brown said she took the board s reasoning into account but would not approve the large payout. The former Eskom CEO resigned from his post in November last year after being implicated in former public protector Thuli Madonsela s state capture report. Last week, the Democratic Alliance (DA) called on Public Protector Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane to probe Molefe s pension payout. The public protector must therefore investigate this highly irregular payout in order to establish on what basis Molefe deserves to receive this amount of money. It is unacceptable that taxpayer money is repeatedly used to benefit underperforming executives who do not deserve it, while vital infrastructure projects are left to gather dust, the party s spokesperson on finance, Natasha Mazzone, said at the time.
