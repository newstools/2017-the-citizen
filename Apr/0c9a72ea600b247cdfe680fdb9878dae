Last year in November Kaizer Chiefs coach Steve Komphela was in the spotlight for giving post-match speeches that left everyone wondering what he was talking about. Soccer fans on Twitter have made endless memes about his utterances, but he will probably be remembered most for what he said last year after Chiefs lost 2-1 to big rivals Mamelodi Sundowns. After losing the match to the champions of Africa, Komphela told Robert Marawa about Jesus, in a speech that left even the Christians confused. He started talking about how Jesus always uses symbols in his teachings, further saying that he, Komphela, likes to put things in a way that has a respect in what I am referring to . He even went as far as asking Marawa if he understood what he was saying, and Marawa admitted he did not. We&#8217;re doubtful anyone else did either. The interview has now been given new life on Facebook in the video below about what happens when you &#8220;ask your African parents a simple question&#8221;.
