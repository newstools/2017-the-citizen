A report surfaced on Sunday that singer-songwriter Zahara is over R350 000 in arrears as for the past nine months she has allegedly failed to pay off the Audi A5 she purchased in 2012. This is according to a report by the Sunday World which alleges that Zahara, whose real name is Bulelwa Mkutukana, is failing to pay her monthly instalments and now her Audi A5 drop-top may be repossessed. The report states that an accountant who saw the account alleged the monthly instalments owed for the vehicle were R12 000, and that the vehicle when purchased in August 2012, cost over R620 000. This isn&#8217;t the first time the star has had trouble with her finances. Last year it was reported that she owed R35 000 on her house loan and was in danger of losing her home in Little Falls. The house was bought for R1,9 million in 2012 through Nedbank and monthly instalments were just under R18 000. She also owed R200 000 in arrears on her water and electricity account. A debt of R5 000 was also written off by furniture store @Home as Zahara failed to settle her credit with them for items she had bought.
