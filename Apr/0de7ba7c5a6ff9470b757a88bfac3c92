Tweleb and poet Ntsiki Mazwai shared her thoughts on TV presenter Bonang and star choreographer Somizi&#8217;s friendship, which has made headlines in the past few weeks. Bonang and Somizi&#8217;s friendship ended after Bonang heard rumours that Somizi told AKA&#8217;s baby mama, DJ Zinhle, about her affair with the rapper. This led to a fall-out with Bonang abruptly ending their friendship. Somizi has spoken out about their friendship, telling audiences on his reality show that why he suspected Bonang stopped being his friend. He also told Anele that he felt he was owed an apology by Bonang, referring to how she had treated him coldly and hadn&#8217;t sought his side of the story. &#8220;I loved that girl, she was my Lebo Mathosa,&#8221; Somiza told Anele. Over the weekend, it was reported that Bonang refuses to be in the same space as Somizi, going as far as to request being moved to a different marquee at the Polo event in Cape Town last month. &#8220;Somizi was broke. Bonang was white capital baby. Somizi did bff things with Bonang and walked away with the white capital babyship? But&#8230; Asikholapho,&#8221; she tweeted. &nbsp; Somizi was broke.
