Nedbank on Thursday told shareholders it was in very good shape and well-prepared to deal with the volatility that a sovereign downgrade to sub-investment grade brings . The bank issued a statement after announcements from international ratings agencies about the downgrading of South Africa s credit ratings in the wake of last week s late-night Cabinet reshuffle. After last Thursday s reshuffle initiated by President Jacob Zuma, which included the axing of Pravin Gordhan, the country s respected finance minister, and his deputy Mcebisi Jonas, S&amp;P Global downgraded South Africa s sovereign credit rating to below investment grade and Moody s put the country on review for downgrade. Thursday s statement from Nedbank noted that South African banks ratings were constrained by the sovereign credit rating and any changes to sovereign ratings were automatically reflected in the bank s ratings. The statement emphasised that the changes reflected assessments of the country and banking industry as a whole and were not specific to Nedbank. Nedbank added that Standard &amp; Poor s had noted that South African banks had been performing resiliently amid slow economic growth and political wrangling. Nedbank Group s chief executive officer, Mike Brown, said: Despite the downgrade, we must remember that Nedbank is operating in a South African banking system that is sound and well-capitalised. He said the bank s financial results in February showed that Nedbank is in very good shape, and we are well prepared to deal with the volatility that a sovereign downgrade to sub-investment grade brings . We have the strategies, people and balance sheet strength to work our way through the difficult environment in South Africa, Brown added.
