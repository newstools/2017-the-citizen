The Proteas will be watching one-day captain AB de Villiers&#8217; fitness closely when the Indian Premier League (IPL) starts on Wednesday. His franchise, Royal Challengers Bangalore, confirmed on Tuesday that the devastating stroke-maker will be missing the side&#8217;s opening match due to a back injury. Also read: The Proteas stars in this year s Indian Premier League While it&#8217;s considered a minor injury, it was troublesome enough to have kept De Villiers out of last week&#8217;s domestic One-day Cup final between the Titans and Warriors. The last thing South Africa needs before next month&#8217;s tour of England and the ICC Champions Trophy is the 33-year-old picking up niggles again. De Villiers only returned during January&#8217;s one-day series against Sri Lanka after a long layoff due to an elbow injury. He was outstanding in last month&#8217;s 3-2 series win over New Zealand. The good news though is that De Villiers did train on Monday with the Challengers, suggesting he should return sooner than later. &#8220;He still has some minor discomfort and we felt that a couple of days off would be best before we have him back in action,&#8221; said Daniel Vettori, RCB&#8217;s head coach. &#8220;We hope to see him on the field in good form this weekend.&#8221; Yet given De Villiers&#8217; injury troubles, the Proteas won&#8217;t quite sleep as easily until he reports back for national duty.
