Ten days after his appointment, Thulas Nxesi finally made his first public appearance as Sports Minister on Monday. And by the time the former Minister of Public Works finished a short speech at the launch of the SuperSport Challenge &#8211; a new provincial rugby tournament starting 21 April &#8211; one was left with just two impressions. Also read: Thulas Nxesi the perfect fit to replace energetic Mbalula? You&#8217;re either going to miss Fikile Mbalula&#8217;s razzmatazz or you&#8217;re going to believe &#8220;boring&#8221; Thulas is a godsend, a relief from all the ego-driven drama of the last six years. It&#8217;s early days but there&#8217;s nothing to suggest the 58-year-old is going to rock the boat. In fact, his main objectives as minister are fairly straightforward. &#8220;Our vision remains the same,&#8221; said Nxesi. &#8220;We want to promote an active and winning nation. It&#8217;s imperative that we continue to increase participation from childhood and promote excellence.&#8221; Of course there was the talk of the new tournament &#8220;broadening the pool of black players for future selection&#8221; and how government remains committed to transformation. But transformation wasn&#8217;t the cornerstone of his rhetoric. He&#8217;s probably more than aware how Mbalula&#8217;s strong sanctions against five national federations last year for failing to meet transformation targets &#8211; rugby and cricket included &#8211; spooked them into action. Nxesi is probably also aware how the Proteas have married results with transformation and how rugby, in the short-term, needs to first survive economically before going full-on &#8220;T-word&#8221;. After all, what&#8217;s the point if black players can&#8217;t make a career out of rugby? Nxesi is definitely still feeling his way but he didn&#8217;t look uncomfortable. He was presented with a Springbok jersey boasting No 1 on the back on stage and immediately put it on. Springbok prop Trevor Nyakane, who&#8217;s played No 1 for most of his career, even mentioned how he and Nxesi joked about &#8220;competing for a place in the national side&#8221;. &#8220;He told me he believes there&#8217;s still work to be done on his physique,&#8221; said a smiling Nyakane. &#8220;But when he&#8217;s developed his abs, I might have a fight on my hands!&#8221; One just wonders how long that type of joviality will last&#8230; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
