The video shows the Imbonerakure, the youth affiliated to the ruling party, impeccably aligned, singing the words impregnate the opposition women so that they give birth to Imbonerakure . In blue and black or red and black uniforms, one of the group also appears in the video singing about the president of Rwanda, Kagame will die . The events took place last week in Ntega commune, province of Kirundo northern Burundi where the young people had gathered to exchange the vows of 2017. The message in the video was seen by the main opposition coalition in exile CNARED as an incitement to mass rape. Minani J remie, one of the spokesmen of this coalition believes that rape in Burundi has become a tool of repression. &#8220;The video incites to generalised rape against the oppositions women, Jeremie said. It is part of the terror of this militia imbonerakure who became a tool of repression, he added. The Secretary of the Ruling party CNDD-FDD in charge of Information, Nancy-Ninette Mutoni acknowledged to the reporters that the intoned song did not accord with the moral of the party. The Disciplinary Commission is working to determine the responsibilities so that the guilty are punished , she pointed out. The distance taken by the CNDD FDD seemed not to convince the CNARED. On Saturday, one day only after the communiqu of the ruling party, the same song was used in a similar event in Ruyigi, Eastern Burundi. What is going on is a copy-paste of what happened in Rwanda before the Genocide of 1994 , said the Spokesman of CNARED. He added that such songs of hate were much used by the Interahamwe, ca Hutu paramilitary organisation created in 1992 and which was involved in Genocide in Rwanda. An anonymous official of the United Nations said the video was extremely troubling . We have a team on the ground and i am sure they are looking into this and can take necessary actions .
