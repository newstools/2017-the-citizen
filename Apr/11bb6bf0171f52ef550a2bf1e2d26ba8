While the ANC showed a sense of unity after its national working committee (NWC) this week, the The Mail &amp; Guardian has revealed that party members who are seen to be against President Jacob Zuma have received death threats. The Mail &amp; Guardian reports that, in particular, threatening messages have been sent to ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe and ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu. The two have also reportedly been labelled CIA spies, with Mthembu further reportedly being accused of &#8220;conniving with opposition parties to plot a &#8216;coup&#8217; against Zuma&#8221;. Meanwhile, National Executive Committee (NEC) member and Minister of Human Settlements Lindiwe Sisulu is reported to have allegedly escaped two assassination attempts.

During internal meetings, Sisulu is, however, reportedly unafraid to &#8220;take the president to task&#8221; and confronted him regarding the Cabinet reshuffle during the NWC meeting. Mantashe and Mthembu have also criticised Zuma&#8217;s Cabinet reshuffle, and furthermore, an ANC MP told the publication that Mthembu was &#8220;[being] targeted for doing what is right for the ANC&#8221; and that he had received calls and SMSes alleging he is a CIA spy. Mantashe has reportedly also received similar SMSes. An ANC NEC member, meanwhile, reportedly said the party&#8217;s integrity committee would compile a new report recommending that Zuma step down after a meeting with the president on April 9, and that the report&#8217;s withdrawal at this week&#8217;s NEC meeting was because not all committee members were aware of the report.
