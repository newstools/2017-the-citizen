The 20th anniversary of the 2017 Standard Bank Joy of Jazz will be one of the largest celebrated festivals on the Johannesburg jazz calendar. While the festival itself celebrates two decades of brilliance, the dynamic team that makes it possible, T-Musicman, will be celebrating 30th years of excellence in the industry. To celebrate the auspicious event, American singer and songwriter Musiq Soulchild (Taalib Johnson) will feature prominently, dispensing his own brand of music that blends R&amp;B, funk, blues, jazz and gospel, fused with hip-hop. He has received a number of awards from Billboard, BET, ASCAP, BMI, and Soul Train. He has also earned award nominations from MTV, the American Music Awards, the NAACP and 11 Grammy nominations, including three for his 2007 album Luvanmusiq. He is one of the most recorded musicians of his generation, appearing on more than 300 recordings as a side man. Event executive producer Peter Tladi of T-Musicman is overjoyed and proud of this year s line-up and overall festival offering. As festival producers, we spend a great deal of time, both here and overseas, seeking out artists we believe will appeal to a wide spectrum of music fans. We want to present a diverse range of jazz styles inclusive of the giants of jazz and the upcoming young lions. There is something for everyone in this year s lineup, said Tladi. The event takes place at the Sandton Convention Centre from September 28 to 30. For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
