German sportswear giant Adidas sparked a social media outcry after sending an email congratulating runners in the Boston Marathon for having &#8220;survived&#8221; the race. The choice of words jarred as memories remain fresh of the 2013 deadly bombing of the event in the Massachusetts city. &#8220;Congrats, you survived the Boston Marathon!&#8221; Adidas said in the subject line of an email it sent to the 26,492 participants who finished the annual race on Monday. The email instantly set off a furore on social media, where many people published screen grabs of the email and denounced its offensive nature. The official Twitter account of Adidas North America, with the handle @adidasUS, rushed to apologize. &#8220;We are incredibly sorry. Clearly, there was no thought given to the insensitive email subject line we sent Tuesday,&#8221; it tweeted. &#8220;We deeply apologize for our mistake.&#8221; On April 15, 2013, two brothers of Chechen descent, Tamerlan and Dzokhar Tsarnaev, planted pressure-cooker bombs near the Boston Marathon finish line, killing three people and injuring 264 others. On Monday, Geoffrey Kirui and Edna Kiplagat led a Kenyan clean sweep at the 121st Boston Marathon, winning the respective men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s races. The Boston Marathon is the world&#8217;s oldest annual marathon and one of the most prestigious races over the distance of just over 42 km on the athletics calendar. South Africa&#8217;s wheelchair kingpin Ernst van Dyk finished second in his race. For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
