A 12-year-old boy who died after allegedly jumping or falling from a moving bakkie in Coligny in North West had not been identified by Thursday, a week after he died. North West police spokesperson Brigadier Sabata Mokgwabone confirmed that the boy, who died on April 20 after he allegedly fell or jumped from a bakkie driven by a white farmer, was still unidentified. The farmer was alleged to have found the boy stealing a sunflower from his field close to Scotland informal settlement. The boy was put into the bakkie, but allegedly jumped or fell out when it slowed down to negotiate a curve. He was injured and died later. His death triggered a violent protest in which at least three houses and three trucks were torched and several shops in the small maize producing town were looted. North West police said two men aged, aged 26 and 33, had been arrested on Tuesday in connection with the boy s death. They were expected to appear in the Coligny Magistrates&#8217; Court on Friday, facing a charge of murder. Dozens more have been arrested for offences relating to the burning of a police vehicle, looting and possession of suspected stolen goods in Coligny and Blydeville in Lichtenburg. In a statement, police said six people were arrested for public violence, two for setting the police Nyala alight and 42 for possession of goods allegedly stolen during looting sprees which accompanied the violent protest.
