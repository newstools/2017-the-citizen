Researchers at the Ifakara Health Institute (IHI) now suggest that routine screening for high blood pressure should be integrated into HIV programs in Tanzania and Africa in general.This follows recent findings in a study which revealed that about 12 per cent of HIV patients in rural Tanzania, aged above 15, were found to have high blood pressure at the time of diagnosis.The study was published in the Plos One Journal and it comes as an additional initiative to address the challenge of Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) among People Living with HIV.It s among the first longitudinal studies to have looked at how high blood pressure develops among HIV patients in Sub-Saharan Africa.Other study projects in Tanzania but not connected with IHI have previously advocated integrated screening programs for HIV and NCDs, as per one study project carried out in Mbeya. HIV and AIDS continue to be a huge problem in Tanzania, says Prof Jessie Mbwambo a Psychiatrist at Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences, as she commented on a previous five-year study in Tanzania that seeks to determine whether combining diabetes and hypertension screening with HIV screening will increase uptake of HIV testing and care. We believe that by integrating diabetes and hypertension care with HIV care we can likely improve health in all these domains much more effectively and at a lower cost, says the don.And, in the latest development, researchers from IHI in collaboration with those from Switzerland and Spain looked into the same matter.Among the 955 people infected with HIV, 111of them (11.6 per cent) had high blood pressure at the time of HIV diagnosis, the IHI study shows.It further revealed that an additional 10 percent of the people in the studied group will also develop high blood pressure during the first months of antiretroviral therapy (ART).The study was carried out at a clinic of Chronic Diseases (CDCI) in Kilombero and Ulanga Districts of Morogoro Region.However, the researchers found out that the high blood pressure was neither linked to low immunity levels in the patients nor any particular regimen of Anti-retroviral Therapy (ART). [it] rather predicted [the high blood pressure] basing on risk factors such as age, body mass index and kidney function, reads part of the study.
