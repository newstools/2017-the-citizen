by Kieran CANNING The Spanish international starred by scoring twice, including a 90th minute winner, as a much-changed Madrid side remained three points clear of Barcelona at the top of La Liga with a 3-2 win over Sporting Gijon on Saturday. &#8220;I am at the best team in the world, there is no bigger team than Madrid and I feel fortunate,&#8221; said Isco. &#8220;I want to stay here for a long time.&#8221; The 24-year-old is out of contract at the end of next season which has reportedly sparked the interest of Madrid&#8217;s rivals Barca. And despite 10 goals in all competitions this season he remains a fringe player with coach Zinedine Zidane preferring a midfield three of Casemiro, Luka Modric and Toni Kroos. &#8220;You know what I think of Isco, he is a player I like a lot and his place is here,&#8221; said Zidane. &#8220;There are 24 players and it will always be unfair for those that don&#8217;t play. &#8220;That is the difficult part of this job, leaving very good players on the bench.&#8221; Isco was one of nine changes Zidane made to his starting line-up with the second leg of their Champions League quarter-final against Bayern Munich on Tuesday in mind. However, even without the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema, Real for the umpteenth time this season found a late winner to remain on course for a first La Liga title in five years. And Zidane rejected suggestions Real have got lucky with their late shows this season. &#8220;There is no such thing as luck in football, it is down to hard work and effort in every game,&#8221; continued the Frenchman. &#8220;You have to make your own luck. With the team we have we can cause damage to any team. &#8220;It is in our DNA to fight until the end at Real Madrid and today we pulled it off.&#8221; Isco also hailed Madrid&#8217;s DNA to fight till the end, but accepted the European champions made life difficult for themselves against relegation threatened Sporting. &#8220;We didn&#8217;t control the game like we should have,&#8221; he added. &#8220;They went ahead on two occasions, but this is the spirit of Real Madrid and we have shown it once more. &#8220;It is in the DNA of this shirt and this badge, we have shown it so many times and again today. Until the referee blows the full-time whistle it is not over.&#8221;
