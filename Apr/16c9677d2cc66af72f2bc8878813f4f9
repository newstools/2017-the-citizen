Following her exit from Metro FM on Monday, Bonang Matheba has told followers about her upcoming projects that might take South Africa by storm. Fans on Tuesday took to social media to complain about her absence on the airwaves, asking if there was a planned return for her. &#8220;We need more Bonang in our lives, not less. The withdrawal symptoms,&#8221; one of her followers said. Bonang responded, telling the follower that she would be getting a new radio show without revealing much about it. She also told fans about her new venture when she announced her exit from the station, saying she was &#8220;looking forward to the next chapter of my radio life&#8221;. Her response to the follower has left some wondering if she would be joining Tbo Touch&#8217;s new station, Touch HD. After wishing Tbo Touch a happy birthday, her fans said she should give him the &#8220;perfect&#8221; gift and join his station. Bonang announced her resignation from Metro on Monday shortly after her show, saying that she was left heartbroken after the station only told her about the changes on her show an hour before she went on air. &#8220;After three years of making magic on the Front Row, I can confirm that I have officially stepped down as the host of the show. &#8220;My heart is broken. I was told about the changes to my show an hour before going on air today,&#8221; she wrote on Twitter. Though she told fans this was the reason she left the station, there are rumours that she left because she did not want to work with Lerato Kganyago. Dineo Ranaka has since replaced her.
