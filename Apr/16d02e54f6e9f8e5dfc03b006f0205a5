Police intervene and put the man into the back of a police vehicle for his own protection. &#8220;We have laid criminal charges against the ANC for incitement to violence, and have opened a case of assault and political intimidation for the assault on our member. &#8220;The party marched entirely peacefully, and although the message against Jacob Zuma was firm, our supporters peaceful and lawful conduct must be praised,&#8221; he said. EWN further reported that the ANCYL&#8217;s KZN secretary had said they aimed to confront anti-Zuma marchers after members of the league moved from the CBD.
