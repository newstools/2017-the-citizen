The early features of the KwaZulu-Natal winter season get under way on Sunday with the running of the Grade 3 Byerley Turk and Umzimkhulu Stakes for fillies, both over 1400m on the Greyville turf track. The races are restricted to three-year-olds and many of these horses raced against one another as juveniles at this course last year. Three runners stand out in the Byerley Turk Red Chestnut Road, Africa Rising and Copper Force and Africa Rising could have the edge. He was beaten by Cop per Force in the CTS 1600 but while Africa Rising was well drawn and was always in touch with the leaders, Copper Force failed to overcome No 14 draw and was al ways well back. While he did run on best of all, Justin Snaith s charge never troubled eventual winner William Longsword and was beaten 1.75 lengths. Africa Rising is a better horse over 1400m and Sean Tarry s charge jumps from barrier No 1. Red Chestnut Road scored two facile wins as a juvenile and then got injured. He must have a chance but could still need the run. Based on her 1.95-length fourth behind Nightingale in the Grade 1 Majorca Stakes at Kenilworth on Sun Met Day Final Judgement looks the filly to beat in the Umzimkhu lu Stakes. Her main danger looks to be Sail. &nbsp;
