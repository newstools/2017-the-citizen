Residents of Motsane in Lebowakgomo, Limpopo, on Sunday received set-top boxes from the department of communications in partnership with stakeholders. This is according to a report by SAnews.gov.za, which stated that the boxes converted digital signals so they could be viewed on analogue television sets. Further, it was reported that government was committed to issuing five million subsidised boxes, as the country migrated from analogue to digital broadcasting.

Acting director-general for the department Basani Baloyi reportedly addressed residents from about 16 villages, saying the department had heard about the community&#8217;s network problems and would return with solutions and further encouraged the residents to register their boxes. Baloyi also believed the academic performance of pupils who watched and listened educational shows would be improved. It is further reportedly thought that the digital migration would create new opportunities for business and create jobs in the broadcasting or digital fields. Meanwhile Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) councillor, Paris Mashile, addressed the lack of community radios as a major challenge and said Icasa would establish a Limpopo office for people to submit their complaints in a bid for the process of delivering services to be faster.
