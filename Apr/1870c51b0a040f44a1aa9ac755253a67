While we re still waiting for the updated 4 Series range set to arrive in a few months, Bayerische Motoren Werke AG has a new mid-range model for its M4 line-up that brings a slight power increase to the table. . The limited-run special-edition BMW M4 CS slots between the BMW M4 Coupe, M4 Competition pack and the track-focused M4 GTS. Set to reach our dealership floors in the third quarter of 2017, the car gets a power bump from the 331kW Competition Pack model to 338kW. . This is not an enormous power boost but BMW says the M4&#8217;s 3.0-litre twin-power turbocharged inline-six engine can get the CS running from 0 to 100km/h in 3.9 seconds the Comp Pack-equipped cars manage 0 to 100km/h in four seconds flat. The CS will max at 280km/h. It&#8217;s not much of a change, but it&#8217;s something. . BMW says the CS comes standard with a seven-speed M DCT transmission; my condolences are with those who wish to row their own gears. The CS also comes standard with BMW&#8217;s Adaptive M suspension and a newly designed wheel setup that comes wrapped with Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2s. In the interest of lightness, the new edition has alcantara-covered seats, door panels with pull-loops, and a roof constructed of carbon fibre-reinforced plastic. For those who care, BMW claims a N rburgring Nordschleife lap time of 7 minutes 38 seconds with the CS. To give you some reference, that&#8217;s six seconds short of Alfa Romeo&#8217;s 7 minute, 32-second time with the 376kW Giulia Quadrifoglio. . It&#8217;s unclear how many CS model cars will be built, but BMW says it will be kept to a limited run.
