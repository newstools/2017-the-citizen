Since announcing her shock resignation from Metro FM on Monday, Bonang Matheba has cleared up the confusion about what influenced her decision to leave the public broadcaster. Every year in April, radio stations announce a new line-up of presenters for the different timeslots. Usually, station management will communicate their intentions to pair up media personalities with each other and later inform the public through a press statement. However, it appears Matheba was not informed of the changes to her timeslot at 10am and that it would include Lerato Kganyago, who previously co-presented the 3pm slot with Mo Flava. Matheba tweeted she was made aware of this an hour before hosting her show which featured JJ and the Naked DJ. &#8230;.my heart is broken. I was told about the changes to my show an hour before going on air today&#8230; &mdash; Bonang B* Matheba (@bonang_m) April 3, 2017 She later issued a statement, suggesting that having another famous media personality was not in line with her brand. &#8220;After driving the Front Row Show for the last three years I have officially stepped down from my role as the show host today. Metro FM management informed me this morning that they were approaching a different creative direction with the show which no longer aligned to brand Bonang. I will definitely miss my Metro FM listeners, but I do promise to be back soon, as you all know radio is my first love.&#8221; ALSO READ: Bonang has resigned from Metro FM For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
