Organisers have banned all forms of political campaigning at the Old Mutual Two Oceans ultra-marathon in Cape Town this weekend, in line with race rules. &#8220;As a sporting event we celebrate inclusivity and diversity, and strive to unite, not divide,&#8221; organisers said in a statement on Thursday. &#8220;We remain neutral, apolitical and impartial as an event, and are not associated nor condone any political activities.&#8221; Following recent rallies around the country, including Cape Town, the organisers said they would not allow any participants or supporters to engage in political activity along the route. This would include the distribution of flyers, and participants wearing a political part&#8217;s regalia or insignia. Over 30 000 entrants were set to compete at the annual running festival, to be held over two days. Aside from the 21km and 56km road races taking place on Saturday, trail races and fun runs would be contested on Friday, with the race rules applying to all events.
