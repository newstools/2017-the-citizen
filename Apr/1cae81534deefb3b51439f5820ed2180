Radio veteran Bob Mabena did his last show on Kaya FM on Friday, 28 April, after hosting &#8216;180 with Bob&#8217; for more than 10 years. Mabena announced early last month that he is leaving Kaya FM to join the company as its Group Head of Programming in its broadcasting department. &#8220;I am looking forward to working with entrepreneurs who are committed to the radio medium and who understand its power in shaping the social and business landscape of our country. I have lived radio throughout my career and believe my new role will allow me to apply my extensive broadcast experience in the boardroom,&#8221; said Mabena about his new adventure. It has been an honor and privilege to serve you. This is not goodbye. This me sending love back to you for today.
