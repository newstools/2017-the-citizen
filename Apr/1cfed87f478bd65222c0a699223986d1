Springbok rugby coach Allister Coetzee would be forgiven for not being a fan of Super Rugby. Already under immense pressure after a dismal 2016 in charge of the Boks, Coetzee was given bad news when Bulls flyhalf and captain Handre Pollard and Lions centre Rohan Janse van Rensburg were sidelined through injuries. Pollard s ankle injury has ruled him out for up to 10 weeks, while Janse van Rensburg s knee injury keeps him out of action for three months. The start of the three-Test series against France in Pretoria, Durban and Johannesburg is only more than a month away. A bad showing in June against the Tricolors could mean the end of Coetzee s reign after he only managed four wins from 12 Tests last year. Not that Pollard and Janse van Rensburg would have walked into the national team, but their injuries just shrink the pool from which Coetzee can pick. The Pollard injury is probably his biggest headache. Pat Lambie has been on the sidelines since the start of the Super Rugby, having fractured a vertebra. He is still a few weeks away from returning to action. Lions flyhalf Elton Jantjies hasn t managed to find his feet at international level playing a different style under Coetzee. The next few weeks will be anxious ones for Coetzee. For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
