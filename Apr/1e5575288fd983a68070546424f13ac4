The Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC), which has taken over the National Traffic Information System (eNatis), says the system has been running in the past few hours without reported incidents . RTMC officials took over the control of the system this morning following a decision by the North Gauteng High Court to dismiss an application for leave to appeal lodged by Tasima, it said in a statement. Tasima who had been contracted to build, operate and hand over the system had challenged the court&#8217;s order, issued on Monday, instructing the company to hand over the system and vacate the premises in Waterfall, Midrand. Today the Justice N. Tuchten ruled that Tasima&#8217;s application had no prospect for success and dismissed their application. The Sheriff then moved in to enforce the court order as Tasima had shown no willingness to hand over the system voluntarily and vacate the premises. Officials are currently securing the system to prevent unauthorised access. This brings to end a legal dispute that has dragged on in courts for years at huge public expense.
