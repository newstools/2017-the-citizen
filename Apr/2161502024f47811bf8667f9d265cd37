Fitch Ratings downgrade of South Africa is a vote of no confidence in newly appointed Finance Minister Malusi Gagaba s ability to hold the fiscal line and stabilise debt, the Democratic Alliance said on Saturday. Gigaba s attempts to restore confidence and engage ratings agencies failed to convince Fitch not to downgrade South Africa, DA spokesman David Maynier said on Saturday. Malusi Gigaba s attempts to restore confidence &amp; engage ratings agencies failed to convince #Fitch not to #downgrade SA. @DavidMaynier &mdash; Democratic Alliance (@Our_DA) April 8, 2017 The fact is that the decision by Fitch to downgrade our long-term foreign currency debt and long-term local currency debt to BB+ , or junk status , with a stable outlook , is a vote of no confidence in the minister s ability to hold the fiscal line and stabilise debt, he said. This should come as no surprise given that Gigaba was trying to convince the ratings agencies that he could hold the fiscal line and implement radical economic transformation , which was simply not credible. It was not good enough for Gigaba to simply concede the ratings downgrade was a setback . He needed to roll up his sleeves and get into the fight to avoid further ratings downgrades. It s not good enough for the minister to simply concede the ratings #downgrade was a setback . @DavidMaynier &mdash; Democratic Alliance (@Our_DA) April 8, 2017 The minister s number one priority should be to avoid the nightmare scenario where massive forced selling of our debt triggers an economic meltdown that will spare nobody, rich or poor, Maynier said. The minister needs to roll up his sleeves &amp; get into the fight to avoid further ratings downgrades. @DavidMaynier #JunkStatus https://t.co/Ne480DC8Xd &mdash; Democratic Alliance (@Our_DA) April 8, 2017 This could happen if S&amp;P Global and Moody s downgraded South Africa s long-term local currency debt, which made up about 90 percent of South Africa s debt, to junk status . However, the problem is that the ratings agencies do not trust the minister; they regarded him as a presidential minion ready to carry out any instruction no matter how damaging to the economy. Minister Gigaba&#39;s number one priority should be to avoid an economic meltdown that will spare nobody, rich &amp; poor. @DavidMaynier #JunkStatus &mdash; Democratic Alliance (@Our_DA) April 8, 2017 This could happen if Standard &amp; Poors &amp; Moody s downgrade our long-term local currency debt to junk status . @DavidMaynier #JunkStatus https://t.co/MNcQ4RxXIP &mdash; Democratic Alliance (@Our_DA) April 8, 2017 To re-establish trust, Gigaba would have to show, rather than tell, ratings agencies that he was serious about avoiding further downgrades by delivering quick wins , starting with saying no to bailouts for zombie state-owned entities such as the SABC, Maynier said. The problem is that the ratings agencies do not trust the minister. @DavidMaynier #JunkStatus &mdash; Democratic Alliance (@Our_DA) April 8, 2017 To re-establish trust, the minister will have to show ratings agencies that he is serious about avoiding further #downgrades. @DavidMaynier &mdash; Democratic Alliance (@Our_DA) April 8, 2017 ALSO READ: Downgrade: a wake-up call for SA to revisit key economic policies African News Agency (ANA) For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
