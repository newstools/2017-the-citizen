Established by Fashion Designer Maria Foster in 2016, Maboneng Fashion Week is a platform for designers to showcase street fashion. For the smaller brands and designers it is a platform, and increases visibility of the Maboneng area in Johannesburg as a centre for fashion design entrepreneurs, and to attract both national and international buyers, and to liaise with established foreign fashion weeks (e.g. through exchange programmes). In the first of a series of events leading up to Maboneng Fashion Week to take place in October, the search is on for the ultimate Face of Maboneng Fashion Week. The Maboneng Fashion Week Face of January, February and March will compete against each other at Melrose Arch Piazza for the Grand Finale on April 8. The streets of Melrose Arch will come alive this spring with unsung designers ideas of the latest jeans, sneakers or baseball caps, using high-tech fabrics and old-school approaches, says Foster. Co-Founder Thomas Hofmann says Maboneng Fashion Week will be an extravaganza with street-wear runway shows accommodating all ethnicities.
