The politics of last week&#8217;s decision to cut two South African teams from Super Rugby dominated the build-up to this weekend&#8217;s action. And ironically, the script played out like many would&#8217;ve expected. The Lions showed their are still the best side in South Africa, while the Kings and Cheetahs, unfortunately, didn&#8217;t do much to state their cases of surviving the chop. Why the Lions are a champion side There are many hallmarks to a great rugby side. But after the Lions beat the Stormers 29-16 at Newlands, captain Warren Whiteley touched on a very important thing that makes this side special. &#8220;I must say, over the last couple of years, the best teams in Super Rugby have brought out the best in us,&#8221; said the Springbok eighthman. &#8220;When we&#8217;re under pressure, we perform at our best. The Stormers spent a lot of time in our 22-area and we ground out the win.&#8221; Whiteley has ammunition to back that up. In 2015, they beat the eventual champions the Highlanders after being 20-3 down; beat New Zealand opposition to reach the 2016 final and now this historic Newlands triumph. &#8220;I actually didn&#8217;t know we&#8217;ve never won a Super Rugby game in the Cape. Rudolf Straeuli (the Lions CEO) came to me and said we&#8217;ve made history again. It&#8217;s a nice achievement.&#8221; The Lions truly do beat the best. Stormers need not be depressed There&#8217;s no reason for Robbie Fleck&#8217;s men to suddenly have doubts after their loss to the Lions. They didn&#8217;t deliver a particularly good performance but they&#8217;re also not a finished product. What the Stormers experienced on Saturday was an important learning curve. They&#8217;re at the beginning of an exciting journey and are going to have to find consistency. It happened with the Lions too a few years back. &#8220;Last year the Lions were able to back up those kind of performances &#8211; like the one we delivered against the Chiefs &#8211; week in and week out,&#8221; said Fleck. &#8220;That was our challenge this week, to back up last week&#8217;s performance and we didn&#8217;t. We have to work hard and come back.&#8221; Phew! The Bulls&#8217; Boks are back (sort of) Bulls coach Nollis Marais hailed Trevor Nyakane as one of the stars in the 26-13 over the Jaguares. And South African rugby should be rejoicing. &#8220;That was one of his best performances ever &#8211; scrummaging wise and defensively,&#8221; said Marais of his tighthead prop. &#8220;He had a huge impact on the team in this game. You don&#8217;t get players like him easily. People doubted Trevor can make the move to tighthead and he scrummed superbly against one of the best scrumming sides.&#8221; Nyakane&#8217;s improved form is part of a broader theme, where the Bulls&#8217; national players are starting to find form again. Heaven knows, Bok coach Allister Coetzee needs men like Nyakane, Jesse Kriel and Handre Pollard to be at their best again. &#8220;Jesse was great. I told him I needed a big performance from him again and he delivered,&#8221; said Marais. Cheetahs collapse down to inexperience Maybe Franco Smith, the Cheetahs coach, is right not to look too deeply when assessing his side&#8217;s 41-27 loss to the Chiefs. This was a stunning collapse &#8211; they led 24-0 but then &#8220;lost&#8221; the last 55 minutes 41-3. Perhaps the expectations for this side is too high. After all, they lack truly world-class players and are also still learning under Smith. &#8220;We really come close to victories and work really hard,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There&#8217;s fighting spirit but it&#8217;s never a good sign when a side looks at a big lead and then stops playing. That&#8217;s what we did. And to stop doing that, we need to be more experienced. We still need to remember that the Currie Cup and Super Rugby aren&#8217;t the same tournaments.&#8221; But how long can one excuse wiping out 24-point leads?
