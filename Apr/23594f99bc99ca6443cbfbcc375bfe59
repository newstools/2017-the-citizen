Tension has gripped Nigeria s biggest state after a video clip circulating in the social media purported the governor had been stoned by angry residents. It had been suggested governor Abubakar Sani Bello of the central Niger State was stoned and booed while on his statewide Mid-Term Project Assessment and Meet the People Tour. This is not true. This cannot be true, said the governor s spokesperson, Jibrin Baba Dace. He said the video was one of the tricks of social media insurgents who are merchants of fake news, masters of distraction and harbingers of discord and disharmony that have nothing to offer the society, only to terrorise and undermine individual, corporate organisations and established brands . Dace claimed his boss was one of the most beloved governors in Nigeria and interacted freely with his people. He has since May 29, 2015, adopted a leadership style unprecedented in the history of Niger state. His unique and consistent style is interacting with people at every opportunity. Dace said the Niger State government dissociated itself from the video, which might also likely be spread to undermine the former governor, Mu azu Babangida Aliyu . Dace claimed Bello was highly appreciated by the people. He will not be distracted by the mischief of some gullible worms grovelling and feeding over the slimy crumbs of sentiment.
