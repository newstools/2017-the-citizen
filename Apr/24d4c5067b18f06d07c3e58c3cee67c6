The Rustenburg licensing and testing station is offline due to a contractual dispute between the Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) and Tasima, the municipality said on Thursday. Currently, all capturing units, including [the] eye test machines are offline. This means there are no services rendered at the driving licence testing station and the renewal thereof. It is only application and issuing of learner licences that are being done, said spokesperson Thapelo Matebeis in a statement. He said the municipality was in talks with the provincial and national department of transport to bring the situation at the testing station to normal. The High Court in Pretoria, early in April ordered Tasima to hand over the control of the national electronic information system (eNatis) to the RTMC. This was after the RTMC approached the court to enforce a Constitutional Court order granted in November last year, ordering Tasima to hand over to RTMC within 30 days. The two were presently at loggerheads about invoices totalling R100 million, which Tasima said it was owed, but which RTMC refused to pay.
