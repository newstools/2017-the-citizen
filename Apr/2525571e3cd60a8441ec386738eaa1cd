Police Minister Fikile Mbalula on Monday told disgraced former Hawks boss Berning Ntlemeza to respect the court process. Mbalula said this after Ntlemeza told City Press that he had no intention of quitting as Hawks head and would report for duty on Tuesday after &#8220;taking four days&#8221; leave. Ntlemeza also said that he intended to remain in his position until 2022, when his term officially ends. Ntlemeza s appointment was nullified by the High Court in Pretoria. On Wednesday the court ruled that its earlier finding that Ntlemeza was not a fit and proper person to lead the Hawks should come into immediate effect even though he has appealed the ruling. Following the damning court ruling, Mbalula appointed Yolisa Matakata as the new acting national head of the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (DPCI), or Hawks. Ntlemeza remains a police officer and has not yet been subjected to disciplinary procedures by the police. He therefore remains a member of the SA Police Service (SAPS). Mbalula said Ntlemeza needed to respect court process, SABC online reported. If he understands the law properly, he will understand his place, Mbalula said. The minister also said if Ntlemeza had any issues with the ruling, he must write to the court and not him as he was not the court but was merely implementing the its decision. Speaking of Ntlemeza&#8217;s intention to report for duty, Mbalula said he d meet the disgraced Hawks boss there come Tuesday. He says he s coming by force to the office, it s fine. We ll see him there but the law will be executed. We don t need the drama, we ve got work to do, Mbalula said.
