Initially launched in SA in 2014, the Hyundai Grand i10 has proven to be among the list cars first car buyers look at as a runaround vehicle, and for the 2017 model year, Hyundai is introducing a fresh new appearance on its Grand i10 with the addition of a few new body panels and new wheels. . According to Stanley Anderson, sales and operations director of Hyundai Automotive SA, the Grand i10, which is in the middle of its lifecycle, has been an attractive small hatchback since it original launch. The new Grand i10 is still available in three derivatives, however, there are slight changes in the specification levels. You get a 1.25 Motion paired with a 5-speed manual gearbox, Grand i10 1.25 Motion with a four-speed automatic gearbox and the Grand i10 1.25 Fluid which tops the list with a 5-speed manual gearbox and a higher level of standard features. Starting with the interior, the refreshed Grand i10 comes standard with grey cloth seats with grey inserts and a wide range of standard convenience features such as a manual air conditioner, a sound system with a radio, USB and AUX inlet plugs, and a CD and MP3 player. Integrated Bluetooth is also a standard feature in all three derivatives. Like the model it replaces, the Grand i10 is still roomier with an impressive 256 litres of trunk capacity. Up to 1 202 litres becomes available when the rear seats are folded. The refreshed Grand i10 features a redesigned front fascia incorporating Hyundai s signature hexagonal front cascading grille with a honeycomb mesh, while the fog lamp enclosures in the redesigned front bumper have been thoroughly updated for an increased sporty appearance. At the rear an integrated thin roof spoiler with a stop lamp and rear combination lights combine with a redesigned rear bumper. A new set of 14-inch diamond-cut alloy wheels (on the Grand i10 1.25 Fluid manual) adds character to the compact hatchback. Colour-coded door handles and side mirrors, with turn indicators built into them, combine with the well sculpted door panels to create an attractive car. Outstanding features of the modern engine include: A dual overhead camshaft (DOHC), dual continuously variable valve timing (CVVT), a very stiff cast aluminium block with cast iron liners, aluminium cylinder head, lighter connecting rods and maintenance-free long-life timing chain. The 1 248cc engine delivers 64 kW peak power at 6 000 r/min and reaches its maximum torque delivery of 120 Nm at 4 000 r/min. The power is delivered in a spirited fashion and the small, yet perky engine never gives the impression that it is labouring. Fuel consumption can be as low as a measured 5,9 litres/100 km, with emissions of 133 g/m, in the 1.25 Motion manual and 1.25 Fluid manual derivatives, and 6,9 litres/100 km with emissions of 147 g/km for the 1.25 Motion with the four-speed automatic gearbox. Pricing At a price range from R186 900 to R203 900, with Hyundai s 7 year/200 000 km warranty, as well as 5 year/150 000 km roadside assistance thrown in, the Grand i10 offers exceptional value. A service plan is an optional item.
