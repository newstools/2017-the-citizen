Mike Miller-trained Call Me Winter has shown very good form in four starts on the Greyville Polytrack and has established a record of three wins and a close-up third place. She will be the one to catch in Race 4, a FM 88 Handicap over 1200m at the course on Friday night. The Western Winter filly steps up in distance from 1000m which has suited her recently and she will be giving chunks of weight to all her rivals, but in saying all that she will give jockey Alec Forbes a good ride. Two other runners on the card who could be worth looking at are On Your Life in Race 3 and First Apostle in Race 7. On Your Life was a decent fourth on this surface in February and followed that up with two fair runs on the turf. Back on the Polytrack and dropped to 1000m will suit this Right Approach gelding. Wendy Whitehead-trained First Apostle looked a likely winner when running up a string of runner-up berths late last year and early this year but has disappointed in his last three starts. However, this time he drops in distance and that could make all the difference. For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
