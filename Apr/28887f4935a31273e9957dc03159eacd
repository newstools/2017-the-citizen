Bhusmani Simphiwe Mabaso, 32, will spend the rest of his life in prison after being found guilty of rape in Ladysmith Magistrates&#8217; Court. The crime took place during the latter part of 2015 when two young sisters were returning home from an errand they had run for their mother, Ladysmith Gazette reported. It was just after 11am, and the girls were walking to Ezakheni C-Section, where they lived. They were using a footpath that led in between houses when they were approached by a man. The oldest of the two girls was only 12 at the time. The man got hold of her hand and instructed the younger girl to continue on her way home. He forced the girl into a nearby dwelling, covering her mouth with his hands. Once inside, he undressed the youngster, promising her a cellphone and R100 if she kept the incident a secret. He then raped her and fled the scene. The traumatised victim made her way home and immediately told her mother. Police were informed and responded swiftly, arresting the suspect. He was charged with rape and appeared in the Ezakheni Magistrates Court, where bail was denied. The case docket was prepared for court, and once the DNA report was received, a trial date was set. Mabaso was sentenced in the Ezakheni Regional Court on Tuesday, April 4, to a term of life imprisonment. He was found unfit to possess a firearm, and his name is to be entered into the National Register of Sexual Offenders. The case docket was investigated by Sergeant MH Mazibuko of the Ladysmith Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit. &#8211; Caxton News Service For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter .
