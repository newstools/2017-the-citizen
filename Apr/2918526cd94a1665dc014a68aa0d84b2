Minister of Police Fikile Mbalula knows how to party and has taught us some moves, in a video that is circulating on social media. L&#8217;vovo can be seen performing on stage with the minister right next to him when they decide to dance together. We&#8217;re not sure if L&#8217;vovo decides to give Mbalula the spotlight or accepts defeat, but we think the minister takes this one.
