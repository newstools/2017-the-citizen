The African National Congress on Sunday welcomed the incident free payment of social grants by the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa). By the close of the day yesterday [Saturday], more than six million transactions valuing over R3 billion had been processed, giving much needed financial support to millions of our people, ANC spokesman Zizi Kodwa said. Meeting the deadline of April 1 had served to deal with the anxieties, restlessness, and suspicions our people may have had on whether they would receive their grants on time , he said. It further reaffirmed the ANC s commitment to providing, uninterrupted, a social security net to alleviate poverty among the vulnerable in our society. The provision of social grants remained a crucial component of the ANC s abiding commitment to provide social security to the poorest of the poor in society. The focus of the ANC-led government now, as directed by the ANC national executive committee, had to be on accelerating the in-sourcing of the payment of social grants as a critical service. Further, the building of the requisite capacity in the state machinery to deliver on this imperative, Kodwa said.
