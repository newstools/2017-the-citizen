There could be some good value for the brave on Wednesday s Scottsville card. There are only seven races and the fields are generally small but the old expression about the smaller the field, the bigger the upset could well apply. Race 4 is the Middle Stakes over 1600m and although this is not a handicap, based on merit rating there no runner who stands out with a major handicap advantage. There are a trio of horses who have only raced four times Wynkelder, Heir Line and Cape Fling. They look to be quite talented and occupy the top three slots on bookmakers boards. Dean Kannemeyer-trained Cape Fling has won three of his four starts but although bred in Ireland and six months younger than his South African rivals, he is already a four-year-old and must have his issues. Bred in the purple he is by High Chaparral out of a Danehill Dancer mare he was gelded before his first start last August. Two of his three wins have been on the Polytrack at Greyville and this is his first start at Scottsville. Heir Line has won his last two starts but takes a jump in class while Wynkelder is only a one-time winner and is joint top weight. He ran unplaced last time over this course and distance but it was against stronger company and he does have Anton Marcus up. Sitting at 7-1 is Sean Tarry-trained Lonely Arethebrave who has placed in his last two starts at this course. At five years old he is a lot more experienced than his rivals and could just be the horse they all have to beat. For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
