Racing makes its way back to Kimberley today and although I don t see a jockey and trainer combination performing as well as Khumalo and Tarry did on Saturday, I do foresee jockey Gunter Wrogemann and trainer Stephanie Miller scoring a valuable double on what appears to be a very competitive card. Two Gunsy attempts to record back to back victories when he lines up in Race 5, a MR 62 Handicap over 1800m. A son of Bold Silvano, he left quite a memorable impression in his last victory when overcoming a wide No 13 draw to burst 5.25 lengths clear of his opposition. This makes it very hard to tip against him. Much is in the favour of this gelding. Firstly, this isn t the strongest of fields, he shoulders a light 55kg and most importantly, this three-year-old is yet to run out of the money over the course and distance I don t see this changing today. Wrogemann also rides Red Special again for the Miller yard &#8211; who could arguably be the best bet on the card in the next race, a Pinnacle Stakes over 1400m. This hat-trick hopeful has defeated a handful of runners in this event, therefore rates the one to beat. He shoulders 60kg and I m hoping his class sees him through the wide No 14 draw. This son of Kahal showed tremendous heart in his last victory when fighting hard to edge out Royal Master by a narrow 0.25 lengths. He drops back to his favoured trip and should be in fine fettle. Wrogemann has steered this four-year-old gelding to victory seven times before, they stand a big chance of making it eight. Ironically, should Stephanie Miller s charge fluff his lines, another Miller runner &#8211; from the Cliffie Miller yard &#8211; could steal the show. Cliffie sends out Western Force who is ultra-consistent, jumps from a good No 7 draw and shoulders 55.5kg, that s 4.5kg less than Red Special watch!
