In Mbombela, Mpumalanga, locals joined the national &#8220;Zuma Must Fall&#8221; protest action at the corner of the R40 and Samora Machel Drive, the Lowvelder reports. The protest was organised by civilians to call for the president s resignation. Some of the placards held by protesters included messages such as Impeach the Leech and South Africa must rise . Buscor stated that its buses would run as usual and would not be affected by the strike. Later on Friday, it is alleged three DA members were stopped by a large number of police at the Pick n Pay Centre after the peaceful protest march, and asked to go to Nelspruit Police Station for interrogation. When Lowvelder arrived at the shopping centre, there were several SAPS officers in the parking lot, as well as various police vehicles. The officer who was communicating with the three DA members said he was just doing his job and that orders had come from number one yet it is unclear who number one is. According to Trudie Grov -Morgan, police vehicles had followed her and the two other DA members, Sanley van der Merwe and Gerard le Roux, from the Nelspruit Rugby Club (NRC) where the march had ended after lunchtime. They approached us already while we were cleaning up at NRC, asking us if we knew a guy with grey, wavy hair. We said we could not help. They asked us to go to the police station and we said no and continued driving to the Pick n Pay Centre, Grov -Morgan said. Police stopped us and we were asked once more to go to the station. We said we would not go without our lawyer present. The police&#8217;s Captain Dawie Pretorius said he was not aware of the situation and could not comment if a criminal case had not been opened.
