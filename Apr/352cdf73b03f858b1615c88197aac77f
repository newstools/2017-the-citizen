If Stokkies Hanekom comes on as replacement for the Kings against the Waratahs in Sydney on Friday, it would be a rather ironic twist of fate. Four years ago, the 27-year centre delivered one of the more devastating blows to rugby in the Eastern Cape. In the first of two controversial promotion-relegation matches, Hanekom scored both the Lions&#8217; tries in a vital 26-19 victory that eventually led to the Kings&#8217; demotion from Super Rugby. The strapping 1.93m, 101kg midfielder was supposed to roar like the Lions did after that. But indifferent form and a rash of injuries saw other teammates streak ahead of him. Now on-loan to the Kings, Hanekom needs to add value to the side he sunk in 2013. There&#8217;s no hard feelings though. In fact, the Kings are grateful for him providing depth at a time when some of their stars in the backline are starting to feel the pinch. &#8220;(Wingers) Yaw Penxe and Malcolm Jaer (who sustained a knee injury after the Force game) are youngsters who did a great job for us,&#8221; said coach Deon Davids on Wednesday. &#8220;We are lucky to fall back on the experience of Stokkies, who joined us. We are hopeful (he&#8217;ll) will grab the opportunity and make the step up.&#8221; It&#8217;s been a tough tour results-wise to date for the men from Port Elizabeth but they&#8217;ve certainly been competitive, especially on the attack. More importantly, it at least seems as if team spirit has been decent. We are a team that has grown tremendously on and off the field. The players have adapted well to the challenges of Vodacom Super Rugby. As a teammates they have grown closer to one another, he said. It is still a process, but with each game we are improving. I think we will continue to do that throughout the competition.We want to end the tour well.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
