Ibrahimovic, 35, opened the scoring in the 30th minute of Sunday&#8217;s game at the Stadium of Light, rolling Billy Jones and crashing a shot into the bottom corner from the edge of the box. &#8220;The older you are, the more experienced, the more intelligent and you don&#8217;t waste energy on things you don&#8217;t need,&#8221; Ibrahimovic told Sky Sports. &#8220;I feel like Benjamin Button. I was born old and will die young,&#8221; he added, citing the 2008 Brad Pitt film about a man who ages in reverse. Ibrahimovic&#8217;s goal means he has now scored 250 times since turning 30. United manager Jose Mourinho said: &#8220;You need these players to break it. Every team has a couple of them. Zlatan did that.&#8221; Victory saw United close to within four points of Manchester City, who occupy the fourth and final Champions League qualifying berth and have played a game more than Mourinho&#8217;s side. &#8220;The result was good,&#8221; Mourinho said. &#8220;We resisted the results of yesterday when Manchester City and Liverpool won. They left us in a position of &#8216;yes&#8217; or &#8216;no&#8217;. It was &#8216;yes&#8217;.&#8221; The result left Sunderland 10 points adrift of safety at the foot of the table and Mourinho said they had played like a team who were &#8220;close to relegation&#8221;. Sunderland manager David Moyes lamented referee Craig Pawson&#8217;s decision to show Seb Larsson a straight red card for leading with a raised foot in a challenge on Ander Herrera just before half-time. &#8220;Today the result was helped by the referee,&#8221; said Moyes, the former United manager. &#8220;Manchester United were playing well, but the red card was a decision that went against us.&#8221;
