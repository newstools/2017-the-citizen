Celtic Captain s last three runs comprise two feature victories and a second in a Grade 3 event. This Gareth van Zyl gelding has been supplemented to run in the R4-million Premier s Champions Challenge (Grade 1) over 2000m at Turffontein on Saturday 6 May. Before making that stop in Johannesburg, he ll be looking to conquer a MR 102 Handicap over 14000m on the Greyville Polytrack on Friday night. Although he runs his best races over further (1600-2000m), the drop in trip shouldn t raise too many red flags. This son of Captain Al has had two impressive runs over the course and distance, finishing second on both occasions. This is set to change tonight. This Van Zyl-trained gelding has been a different class of horse since finishing 14th in the Grand Heritage (Non- Black Type) last year. He jumps from a decent No 5 draw and even though he ll have to give away a lot of weight to the field, it s hard to see him losing. One run back Celtic Captain was beaten 0.50 lengths into second by Rikitikitana. On that Sean Tarry-trained gelding s recent form, this is unlikely to happen tonight. Denis Drier s charge Sea Fever has run his best races over sprint trips. He wasn t disgraced in his last outing when fourth over 1400m. I just don t believe he s faced enough horses in this particular division. One however, will need to bear in mind this five-year-old son of Argonaut is yet to run out of the money on the Polytrack. He jumps from a good No 3 draw and should be the one to pick up the pieces should Celtic Captain somehow fumble. For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
