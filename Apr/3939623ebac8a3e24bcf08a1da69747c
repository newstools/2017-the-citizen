Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane on Tuesday led a protest in central Polokwane demanding that President Jacob Zuma be ousted from power. Before 11am, the hundreds of protesters led by Maimane arrived at the Limpopo Provincial Treasury which was guarded by numerous police officers. A few Freedom Front Plus and a few Economic Freedom Fighters members joined the protest. A statement released by Maimane s spokesperson Mabine Seabe said the protest was being held in Polokwane because the province was evident to massive corruption bedevilling South Africa. Jacob Zuma and the ANC have normalised the abuse of the people s money and institutions for self-benefit, while neglecting their duty to create jobs and build a better South Africa, said Seabe. There is no better case study than the province of Limpopo corrupted to the point of near bankruptcy, and economically stagnant. Maimane; &#39;Zuma thinks he&#39;ll retire in Nkandla.
