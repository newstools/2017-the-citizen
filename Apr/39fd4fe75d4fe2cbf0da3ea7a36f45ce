There are two Listed races at Greyville on Sunday The Sledgehammer and The Scarlet Lady for fillies and mares and both are over 1800m. Justin Snaith has a strong hand in both and the two runners from his yard Elusive Silva and Prince of Wales could fight out The Sledgehammer. Both will be having their first runs at Greyville but while he will be better over further, the vote goes to Elusive Silva. He has not raced since June last year and could be in need of the run but the engagement of Anthony Delpech seems to indicate a big race is expected. The four-year-old son of Silvano finished only five lengths behind Marinaresco in the Winter Guineas last year, despite having to jump from No 12 draw and he could come back fresh. Prince Of Wales is also coming off a break but he is suited to this sort of distance and should also run well under Greg Cheyne. Sean Tarry has Samurai Blade in the line-up and he could give a good account of himself. Craig Zackey has ridden this gelding twice for a win and a place but the one concern is that in recent races he has reported to be making a respiratory noise. Snaith has three runners in The Scarlet Lady and once again all three are coming back from layoffs. This looks most competitive and perhaps Lucky Houdalakis could pilfer the race with Banking April who is the only six-time winner in the field. Although she is 2.5kg badly handicapped based on merit ratings with the likes of Francia, Qing and Princess Varunya, Banking April could be better than her rating and could provide good value. Her danger could be Party Crasher who is lightly raced and last time, going 1600m for the first time, was just beaten by Ngaga, the half-sister to Igugu.
