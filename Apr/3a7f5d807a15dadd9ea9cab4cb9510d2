Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema is one to always congratulate our local celebs on their achievements &#8211; apart from AKA, who&#8217;s just not the party&#8217;s favourite. Malema is also one politician who knows pretty much everything about the entertainment industry&#8217;s secrets and has never held back from revealing them when necessary. On Sunday morning, he sent his message of congratulations to Tbo Touch on his new station Touch HD, and encouraged his followers to support him. The Touch HD app is now available for download on iTunes, with the description: &#8220;Touch Online aka Touch HD is the next biggest cosmopolitan and urban digital platform based in Africa s richest square mile of Africa. Taking its users and listeners to the future with an offering of innovative, fresh and groundbreaking entertainment audio. &#8220;The web has found their new streaming partner in Touch Online with nothing but the best, cutting edge and unsurpassed audio and visual content. Our channel packages an inspiring line-up of top African stars and celebrity personalities in a creative environment that fully embraces the digital evolution.&#8221; The EFF leader has commended Tbo Touch for managing to achieve all these big things without &#8220;corrupt money&#8221;. Touch launched his new station and has managed to bring on board legendary presenter Tim Modise, Glen Lewis and Thembisa Mdoda, to name a few. City Press on Sunday reported that he is also trying to get every single senior DJ at Metro FM to join him, including Robert Marawa and Unathi Msengana. The station was launched on Tuesday evening at Steyn Estate, north of Fourways, where Touch &#8220;hinted that Marawa&#8217;s contract was in his car&#8221;. An industry insider told City Press Touch was offering &#8220;good money&#8221; to those joining him, but no amounts were specified. He made it clear that he&#8217;s out for revenge on Metro, who he alleges told him &#8220;to just go&#8221; instead of allowing him to host his final show and say goodbye to his listeners. Touch&#8217;s ultimatum is that he still wants that last show or he&#8217;ll just keep poaching Metro&#8217;s talent. Also read: Thembisa Mdoda joins Touch HD &nbsp;
