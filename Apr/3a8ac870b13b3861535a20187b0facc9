It is still a rumour. It looks like we are not that far to have the BMW M2 GTS on our market. According to reports by BMW Blog, prototypes of what is believed to be the upcoming M2 GTS have already been spotted testing and doing some hot laps at the Nurburgring Green Hell , Germany. The M2 GTS is expected to feature a different motor compared to the one that powers the normal M2. Packing a variant of the S55 engine that powers the current BMW M3/M4. . Power is likely to be about 335kW (63kW more than the standard M2). If all is true, the BMW M2 GTS is scheduled to go in production in early 2019 in a limited run of about 1 000 units. No word on torque, but it could be about the same 550Nm as in the M3/M4. Like its limited-run and already sold-out M4 GTS, the M2 GTS will feature lightweight seats with a roll cage, an M Performance Steering wheel adorned with carbon fibre and alcantara, and a centre console and dashboard dressed up in carbon fibre as well. . With more power, even less weight and the same small package, the BMW M2 GTS should be one of the most exciting cars BMW has put since the E46 M3 CSL.
