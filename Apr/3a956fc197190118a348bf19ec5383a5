Former president Thabo Mbeki has urged African National Congress (ANC) MPs to vote in the interest of the country on the upcoming sitting for a motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma. Writing in The Star newspaper on Tuesday, Mbeki said MPs from all political parties were elected by the people and therefore accountable to voters as public representatives, not their political parties. He said the Constitutional Court clarified the role of MPs in the Nkandla judgment. In this context, consistent with its Constitutional mandate, among others, the Constitutional Court explained the place, role and tasks of our MPs, and therefore the National Legislature, strictly as defined by our constitution. It stated, correctly, that our MPs serve in Parliament as representatives of the people, Mbeki said. The former statesman said MPs must act as the voice of the people and not the voice of the political parties to which they belong . It may be that the current controversy has at last imposed on our country the opportunity and obligation the better to define the constitutional and moral relationship between the people and their elected representatives.
