Two of the country&#8217;s top political analysts say the blistering criticism of some of the ANC top six leaders by Zuma-ites, such as Mpumalanga premier David Mabuza, is a desperate attempt by President Jacob Zuma&#8217;s supporters to isolate their opponents in the ANC succession debate. Mabuza, as ANC provincial chairperson, lashed out at ANC deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa and secretary-general Gwede Mantashe in particular, accusing them of setting a bad example within the party. This after the two and later, treasurer-general Zweli Mkhize, publicly opposed Zuma over his recent Cabinet reshuffle. Speaking to journalists in Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, at the weekend, Mabuza said these leaders were not presidents and that Zuma, as president, was the only one with the prerogative to fire and hire ministers. &#8220;They must remember they are not presidents. He&#8217;s the deputy president and he is the SG,&#8221; said Mabuza. He said it was ill-disciplined that the senior members spoke publicly and failed to resolve their differences with Zuma internally. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think they are setting a good example. We are working hard on the ground here to unite the ANC and I can see they are working to divide the ANC,&#8221; he said. Political analyst Dr Somadoda Fikeni said Mabuza, as a Zuma ally, ignored the fact that he is himself an interested party in the issue and could not have it both ways. Fikeni said a balance of scale on public pronouncements regarding the ANC succession debate favoured the Zuma camp as his supporters had been dominating the process throughout. &#8220;Now that the other side is beginning to stand up and launch a counter offensive, Mabuza and others are feeling the pinch. They want to muzzle Ramaphosa and Mantashe so that they don&#8217;t talk about the Cabinet reshuffle for which they were not consulted. But you can&#8217;t have it both ways,&#8221; Fikeni said. According to Fikeni, the ANC youth and women&#8217;s leagues and his premier league made numerous statements in support of Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, whom they anointed as Zuma&#8217;s successor and Mabuza deliberately ignored that. Another analyst, Ralph Mathekga, said Mabuza, as Zuma&#8217;s ally, is worried to see his leader being isolated by his own comrades in the ANC top six. &#8220;If it was the ANC Youth League talking on the issue, he wouldn&#8217;t have reacted in this way or said anything at all. His agenda is not about the ANC, but to protect the interests of his ally, JZ,&#8221; Mathekga said. He said the stance taken by Ramaphosa, Mantashe, Mkhize and others to isolate Zuma and exposed his scheme is the best way for them. Their stance showed that Zuma&#8217;s decision on the reshuffle of Cabinet and firing of the Minister of Finance and his deputy was not a collective decision,&#8221;he said. &#8220;These people are tired of drinking this Kool-Aid from Zuma at Luthuli House. The top six have decided to isolate Zuma by questioning his decision publicly and outside of the party,&#8221; Mathekga said.
