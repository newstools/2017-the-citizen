A man was killed and another injured on Friday morning when their car rolled down an embankment off the Edendale Road in Pietermaritzburg, ER24 paramedics said. ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring said when paramedics and fire services arrived on scene, they found a vehicle lying at the bottom of a small embankment. Once paramedics had made their way down to the vehicle, they found one man lying in the rear passenger seat while another man was found in the front seat. Meiring said the man was assessed by paramedics and they found that he had sustained numerous injuries and showed no signs of life. Unfortunately, nothing could be done for the man and he was declared dead on the scene. The second man was found to have sustained minor injuries. The man was treated for his injuries and then transported to a nearby provincial hospital for further treatment. The cause of the collision is not yet known but local authorities were on scene for further investigations. -African News Agency (ANA) For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
