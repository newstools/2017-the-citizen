Umhlobo Wenene presenter Putco Mafani has left the station to join a new commercial radio station called Rhythm that will be based in East London. Mafani, who hosts Umhlobo&#8217;s breakfast show, IBreakfast Eyondlayo Ekuseni (BEE), will reportedly be a breakfast show host and station manager in a station that will broadcast mainly in English and isiXhosa. CEO of MSG Afrika Group ventures Given Mkhari confirmed the news to The Sowetan, and said the station would go live before the end of July. Mafani is expected to be in Johannesburg in the next few weeks for auditions, a move he says will give new talent a chance. Though he has denied it, rumour has it that Bob Mabena would be joining the new station. He told the publication his contract with Kaya FM was still valid for three months and was not planning to leave his new family in Johannesburg. Also read: New radio show on the cards for Bonang
