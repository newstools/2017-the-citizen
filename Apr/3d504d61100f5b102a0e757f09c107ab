Reality show star and former YFM and 5FM DJ Dineo Ranaka has joined Lerato Kganyago and Naked DJ on Metro FM&#8217;s The Front Row. Ranaka is currently hosting the show with Bonang Matheba&#8217;s former colleagues. Ranaka said Metro FM contacted her on Monday afternoon, again in the evening, then spoke to her colleague Kganyago, and now she is on the show. She said she did not think she would back in radio but was happy to be part of Metro FM. Dineo has been trending since, with listeners happy with her joining the station. In fact, people on social media said she was the perfect replacement, and would give callers &#8220;real&#8221; relationship advice on Ask A Man and back it up with her own experiences. &#8220;Dineo Ranaka knows radio. Good call Metro,&#8221; said actor Florence Masebe. Her move comes only a day after Bonang Matheba resigned from the station, apparently because she did not want to work with Kganyago. On Twitter she wrote: &#8220;After 3 years of making magic on the Front Row, I can confirm that I have officially stepped down as the host of the show. &#8220;I will miss my Metro FM family dearly, as they say all good things do come to an end&#8230;.Looking forward to the next chapter of my radio life. &#8220;My heart is broken. I was told about the changes to my show an hour before going on air today.&#8221; The announcement that left fans unhappy. Also read: You&#8217;re an idiot!
