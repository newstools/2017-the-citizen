Schoolchildren from the troubled area of Vuwani, in Limpopo, are again likely to go for weeks without schooling, should the ongoing protest by residents over demarcation issues not be resolved soon. Irate residents who have been demanding that the Municipal Demarcation Board (MDB) reverse its decision to merge their area with Malamulele and other surrounding villages, to form a new municipality, embarked on a total shutdown of services on Sunday. Speaking to The Citizen on Monday, one of the community leaders, Nsovo Sambo, said the decision to protest was taken by residents recently. We gave residents a report back, which said the MDB declined our application to have Vuwani remain under the Makhado municipality, and they were not happy at all. He said residents have applied for a protest march, but police denied us that , he said. Asked how long the shutdown of services will be in place, Sambo replied: This shutdown of services will continue until such time a decision is taken that Vuwani will remain under Makhado. Whether we are worried about the future of our children or not, is something else [separate matter]. The decision for a shutdown of services is something taken by parents themselves, and some are members of school governing bodies. Previous protests in the area were marred by acts of intimidation and arson. When contacted on Monday, police spokesperson Colonel Moatshe Moepe said the situation was calm. He could not reveal if extra police officers were deployed to the area. For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
