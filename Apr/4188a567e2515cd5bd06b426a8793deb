Traffic volumes skyrocketed on Monday, and national routes were congested as people returned from their holidays and religious pilgrimages, the national traffic department said. All Gauteng-bound national routes were extremely congested, especially the N1, N2, N3, N4, N12 and N17. The country s major routes experienced very high numbers of traffic volumes this Easter Monday as people were returning from their holidays and religious pilgrimages, the department said. From midnight to 1pm on Monday, 75,216 cars were recorded on the N1 with an average of 6,268 vehicles recorded per hour; on the N3 there were a total of 54,636 with an average of 4,553 vehicles per hour; on the N4 there were a total of 33,207 vehicles recorded with an average of 2,767 per hour; the N2 saw 22,441 vehicles in this time with an average of 1,870; and the N12 saw 6,302 vehicles in this time with an average of 525 vehicles per hour. The 24 hour traffic volume figures would be issued on Tuesday, the department said. The department said that on April 13, the N1 carried 172,283 vehicles in 24 hours; the N2 with 73,621 vehicles; the N3 had 136,094 vehicles; the N4 had 129,489 vehicles; and the N12 had 45,988 vehicles. The department said that a total of just over 500,000 vehicles were on the national roads. With Gauteng schools opening tomorrow [on Tuesday], each and every national route leading to Gauteng is expected to carry over 130,000 vehicles on average with the gradual traffic volume increase from morning until the evening [on Monday]. This could see over 700,000 vehicles Gauteng-bound this Easter Monday alone, the department said. Thousands of traffic police officers will be deployed on these routes. The biggest contributing factor to road crashes is expected to be motorists wanting to cover a long distance at a shortest possible time. As a result, moving traffic offences such as speeding, overtaking on barrier lines and overloading are the main contributing factors to road crashes. Fatigue is also a silent killer. The department said that road users should remember that road accidents cost the economy over R142 billion in car repairs, insurance claims, medical costs, and funeral costs. Motorists should exercise extreme care and be vigilant on the road. They must rest after every two hours or every 200km to reduce road crashes related to fatigue, it said. Drivers must stick to the speed limit and obey the rules of the road. All vehicles occupants must wear seatbelts. Younger children must be put on child restrain car seats at all times while the car is in motion, the department said. Drivers should be on the lookout for pedestrians especially near informal settlements where there are no formal crossing points. Over Easter weekend alone, 1738 motorists were caught speeding, 354 for overloading, 843 without drivers licenses and 346 without public drivers permits. Meanwhile, the Department wishes to express its heartfelt condolences to the deceased families of those who lost their loved ones on the N7 head on collision where 8 people perished in the Western Cape.
