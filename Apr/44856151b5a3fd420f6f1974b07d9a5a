On The Right Path has enjoyed his time in Kimberley, having come from the Western Cape, and since his arrival has won four of his six races in the Northern Cape. He clearly loves the sand and last time came back from a four-month break to easily beat Western Force by 1.25 lengths. He is not the best handicapped runner but he could still be running under the radar as far as the handicapper is concerned. Gunter Wrogemann has ridden him in most of his starts at Flamingo Park and is back in the irons once again. Caribbean Bay is the best handicapped runner and holds a 1kg advantage over Rock A Bye Baby based on merit ratings. However, there is always a debate when mares run against the boys over whether the ratings hold up. Caribbean Bay has won six races at this course but the six-year-old has performed better against her own sex. The last time she tried to take on the boys in a handicap over the course and distance, and despite an apprentice taking another a 4kg off her back, she could only finish fifth, beaten 4.75 lengths by Bugaruza. However, this is a stakes race and not only does she have the handicap advantage but also gets 2.5kg off her back thanks to the apprentice claim of Mpumelelo Mjoka and that must put her in contention. Muzi Yeni is always dangerous at this course and he is aboard Rock A Bye Baby. On a line through Western Force, he should go close against On The Right Path.
