In the turbulent atmosphere which currently pervades this country, there is precious little for South Africans to celebrate. So it is especially heartening that Cecil Afrika has run out in his 50th series in World Sevens in Hong Kong this weekend. Afrika has been one of the world s most respected players and feared opponents in the foreshortened seven-man version of rugby for some years. He is an integral part of the successes enjoyed by the Blitzboks. Coach Neil Powell is rightly proud of the contribution Afrika has made to the South African team. Cecil understands this game. He is a strong leader and few players deserve this more than Cecil, he said of the stalwart s milestone. Maybe we can also reward him with a tournament win, like we did with Branco du Preez in Las Vegas. Afrika himself said he will enjoy the moment: I can still recall that first touch, coming off the bench. I had to throw into the lineout, something that was not a strong suit of mine. My hands were pretty sweaty. I also fondly remember my first try a week later in George. It was against France. I also managed two more for my first hat-trick. This one s for Afrika.
