A 47-year-old race car driver died on Friday evening after he was involved in a serious crash during an event on the Phakisa Raceway in Welkom in the Free State earlier in the day. ER24 paramedics provided medical standby at the event and were activated when the driver collided with another race car and overturned several times, ER24 spokesman Werner Vermaak said. When paramedics and event officials arrived on the scene they found that he was in a critical condition. He had to be extricated from his severely damaged car. Once extricated, paramedics continued their treatment and placed him on life support. He had severe head injuries as well as multiple fractures. He was rushed to Mediclinic Welkom for emergency treatment. Sadly, a few hours later he succumbed to his injuries, Vermaak said. -African News Agency (ANA) For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
