Bonang will no longer bring her fabulous personality to Metro FM as she has resigned from the station. According to Daily Sun, she apparently handed in her resignation just an hour ago following her dissatisfaction with the station s decision to pair her with Lerato Kganyago as part of the new line-up. Metro FM has announced several new changes to the station with DJ Fresh presenting the breakfast show with Somizi. Metro FM also announced that Kganyago, commonly known as LKG will be joining Bonang on her popular radio show The Front Row, following Unathi Msengana and Glen Lewis s departure. Glen Lewis left to join Touch HD, former Metro DJ Tbo Touch&#8217;s new online radio station. Unathi has yet to announce where she will be heading.
