Weekends on Metro FM will never be the same again, as DJ Naves and Sphectacula will host their final show at the station this Saturday. The duo confirmed the news on The Fresh Breakfast show with DJ Fresh and said they wanted to focus on other things. The DJs said the decision to leave Metro FM was not an easy one, and did not rule out the possibility of working there again. SABC spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago confirmed to The Sowetan that the broadcaster was currently in the process of appointing a replacement. The DJs&#8217; exit comes after Bonang Matheba, Unathi Mankayi and Glen Lewis also left the station for different reasons. According to speculation, it is the station&#8217;s reshuffle that left some of the presenters unhappy. Also read: Bonang &#8216;lied&#8217;, as she was told about Metro FM changes
