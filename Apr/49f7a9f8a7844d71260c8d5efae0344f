Last Thursday Frank Paul, 7, a pupil from one of school at Kinyerezi in Dar es Salaam came home with a bald patch on his head.This suprised everyone at his home, when his parents asked him what had happened he said a certain boy in Standard Three had shaved his his hair.This was not the first time that such a case had been reported raising questions over what parents and teachers should do to make sure children are safe while at school.Parents know what their children are good at and what things they struggle with whereas on the other side teachers are exerted at teaching children. Having communication meetings like this make teachers and parents find ways how to help children improve in their studies.Through these meetings parents discuss with teachers on their progress and other behavioral issues that affect children while at school and therefore holding their progress.Reinhard Bonnke is a teacher at Atlas Madale Campus, he thinks the only way they can bridge the gap between what happens at home and school is through such meetings because parents get to know their children s behaviour while away from their care. The parent gets to give the teacher lead areas on how to handle the pupil especially those with health complications. Not only that but also the teacher gets to know more about a pupil character, social and academic background, he says.Salustia Makene is a teacher based in Tanga; she thinks it is the only way how parents can get involved children s education welfare. A parent can learn how she is supposed to help the child in academic and all important things concerning children and how to help children while at home, she says.It is very important for a parent to be involved in schools meeting because it motivates a child to learn hard, and have positive attitude towards school.Feedback is very important in the learning procedure and that is why experts suggest that parents and teachers should meet from time to time especially in the early years. It is important to have a healthy and respectful relationship between these sides and that can only happen when they are in constant contact, she says.Reinhard adds that today s children face a lot of pressure in school, they therefore need constant support from both teachers and parents as the child is monitored all the way from home to school and likewise.Prince Elibariki, is a Standard Seven pupil in Kinondoni, he can t remember the last time his parents attended such a meeting , to him most parents today can t find time to attend school meetings and instead ask the house helps to attend these gatherings. There are parents who are so busy, they wake up early in the morning and come back late every day and to tell the truth they never attended any meeting at school, noted the young boy.Just like Prince, Mariam Mahad s parents too are very busy to attend such meetings at her school but she believes that parent-teacher conferences can play a very big role in children s development and academic progress.
