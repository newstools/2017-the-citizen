Socialite Khanyi Mbau&#8217;s drastic change in skin complexion has left many with mixed feelings. This after she posted a picture in which she has a much lighter complexion than her usual skin tone. Also, it had some guessing about what she&#8217;s actually trying to achieve with lightening her skin to almost the colour pink. Most said that the way she is so light now, &#8220;even ancestors cannot recognise her&#8221;, while others called her &#8220;a former black person&#8221;. Another Twitter user suggested the radio and TV personality is trying to be white so she can help blacks take back the land. Even so, another argued, Mbau &#8220;is never getting a piece of land shem&#8220;. However, Mbau is having none of it. She told TimesLIVE that she was unfazed by the negative social media reactions. She said: &#8220;13 years later and people still question everything I do. I just stay blessed,&#8221; she said. So Khanyi Mbau is slowly becoming transparent. &mdash; No mercy (@Datruth_SA) April 18, 2017 *Khanyi Mbau asking for help from her ancestors* Ancestors : Who are you?
