Representing the DA, James Selfe has filed legal papers to have axed Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and his deputy, Mcebisi Jonas reinstated. The pair were fired after they were recalled from an international investor roadshow in London on Monday last week. President Jacob Zuma appointed Malusi Gigaba and Sfiso Buthelezi to take over their positions in a Cabinet reshuffle in the early hours of Friday.

The application also lists the repercussions of Zuma&#8217;s decision, stating it had resulted in the downgrading of SA&#8217;s credit rating to junk status. By filing the papers, the DA has also brought into question Zuma&#8217;s spy report which he relied upon to fire Gordhan. According to that report, Gordhan had sought to establish meetings with people pushing for a change in government in South Africa.
