Stormers coach Robbie Fleck insists he&#8217;s not running into an old brick wall by picking Pieter-Steph du Toit as a blindside flanker. Many of his colleagues have had their noses bloodied in the past when they&#8217;ve switched the Springbok lock to the No 7 jersey. Yet he believes it&#8217;s perhaps the only way to trouble the Crusaders in Christchurch on Saturday &#8211; who boast a pack oozing All Black talent.

When used in that position previously &#8211; especially at Springbok level &#8211; he&#8217;s performed rather disappointingly. It&#8217;s still not enough to convince Fleck that he&#8217;s taking a gamble, perhaps because he knows it&#8217;s probably only a one-off arrangement. &#8220;The Crusaders are a massive threat from the set-pieces. They score a lot of tries from the scrums and lineouts,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Playing Pieter-Steph at 7 also means we have another specialist lineout jumper to counter them. He answers many of the questions that are going to be asked about us. &#8220;It was important that we balanced our loose trio in Siya&#8217;s absence and he goes a long way to doing that for us.&#8221; If Du Toit delivers a good performance though, it will certainly interest the Springbok coaching staff.
