The next month or so won&#8217;t be good for the Proteas&#8217; collective blood pressure. Vernon Philander has them chewing their nails as he undergoes a scan for suspected groin injury, just over a month before South Africa start their tour to England. The stocky seamer is currently playing county cricket for Sussex on a short-term basis as a way of preparing.

Philander did though bat in the second innings but it&#8217;s his ability to bowl that&#8217;s of more interest to the Proteas. AB de Villiers, the Proteas&#8217; one-day skipper, also didn&#8217;t play in the first two games of the Indian Premier League (IPL) for Bangalore following a back strain. It illustrates how Cricket South Africa (CSA) face an uphill battle to keep the national side&#8217;s stars fit for what is a hectic programme. Whether it&#8217;s good for him or not, Kagiso Rabada hasn&#8217;t made his debut in the IPL to date, meaning he&#8217;s been resting for a couple of weeks now. Dale Steyn is also on the mend from a long-term shoulder problem, while Morne Morkel skipped the IPL to prepare for the tour. It would seem then that there&#8217;s enough depth if Philander&#8217;s injury is serious.
