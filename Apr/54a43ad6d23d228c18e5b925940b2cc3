A newborn baby boy was rescued from a shallow grave at a farm in Paddock during the Easter holiday in KwaZulu-Natal, the South Coast Herald reports. The 25-year-old mother, originally from Izingolweni, had left the infant among some timber, covered with sand, at her workplace after she gave birth to the baby boy. Police spokesman Captain Gerald Mfeka said staff at the timber factory where the mother is employed heard the baby crying. They searched and found him hidden underneath some timber, covered in sand. On hearing the commotion, the mother confessed that the child was hers. Her explanation was that she was afraid of her parents. This was her second child, the elder one being four years old, and she felt her parents would not approve of another baby, said Captain Mfeka. The baby was taken to the Port Shepstone Regional Hospital where he was admitted to ICU. The mother was also taken to hospital and released.
