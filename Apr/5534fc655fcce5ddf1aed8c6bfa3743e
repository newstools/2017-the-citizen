The Office of The Chief Justice on Thursday announced the death of KwaZulu-Natal Judge Simon Ndlovu. Ndlovu, who served as a High Court Judge in the province as well as a judge of the Labour Appeal Court, died on Tuesday. Labour Court Judge President Basheer Waglay expressed his deepest condolences to family and friends, saying: We wish his family and loved ones strength and comfort during this difficult period. May his soul rest in peace. According to Judge Wagley, Ndlovu passed his pupillage with honours and obtained the highest mark in the country. Wagley said he joined the Department of Justice in 1972 and worked his way up through the ranks as an interpreter, clerk of the court, prosecutor, magistrate and senior magistrate. In 1995 he was appointed as a regional magistrate. His extra-legal activities included serving on various committees and boards, and part-time lecturing at the University of Zululand. Ndlovu is survived by his wife and daughter. The funeral is set to take place at 10am on Saturday in Durban. A joint memorial service will be held at the KwaZulu-Natal Division of the High Court at 9am on May 5. African News Agency For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
