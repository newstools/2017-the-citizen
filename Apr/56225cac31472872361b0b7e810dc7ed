Fourteen farm workers and their families have been left destitute in Ventersdorp in North West after being dismissed, the provincial Congress of SA Trade Unions (Cosatu) said on Wednesday. Since they have been dismissed by the employer, there has been no food to survive and their kids have no school uniforms, said North West provincial secretary Job Dliso. The workers were dismissed from Boulamont Boerdery farm six months ago. Cosatu, in partnership with the department of community safety and transport management in North West, donated food parcels and blankets to the dismissed farm workers in Ventersdorp. In February, Cosatu said the situation was worse as the farmer had cut off electricity and water to the former workers.
