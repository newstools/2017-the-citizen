Lajawi, a celebrity hairstylist who has worked with Quantico actress Pearl Thusi, Metro FM presenter Lerato Kganyago and The Queen actress Dineo Moeketsi found himself on top of the trends list on Twitter. A client of his, @Sentabeleng took to Twitter to share how she had just received a haircut, commonly known as a fade from him. She paid R550 and tweeted for referrals as the price was seemingly too much for the simple hair cut. &#8220;If you&#8217;re in JHB and your barber is dope and prices are lower please refer me,&#8221; she said. The responses that she got are probably not what she anticipated because a hashtag was started with #thingsIcandowithR550. One person advised that R550 would be enough to buy Bonang a lunchbox so she wouldn&#8217;t complain about the food anymore every time she boards an SAA flight. Another cheekily said they would buy Khanyi Mbau some black polish so she could return to her original colour. #ThingsIcanDoWithR550 buy oros and drink it lyk net for kontrol pic.twitter.com/Ytnr5JgSrj &mdash; MONDLANE (@shaunmasho17) April 20, 2017 #ThingsIcanDoWithR550 buy lots of polish for khanyi mbau to return to her original colour; BLACK! &mdash; Lebogang Chilwane (@lebo_chilwane) April 20, 2017 Buy Bonang a lunch box Maybe she&#39;ll chill #ThingsIcanDoWithR550 pic.twitter.com/IjF8odBFFc &mdash; 24 A P R I L (@xoNYIKOxo) April 20, 2017 #ThingsIcanDoWithR550 &quot;cooldrink&quot; for this guys pic.twitter.com/R0T8IQ3JoP &mdash; A U B R E Y (@KingAubz) April 20, 2017 Hire someone to teach her how to use a comma #ThingsICanDoWithR550 pic.twitter.com/H31QY4pn3L &mdash; Bob Zirconia (@CROUPON) April 20, 2017 Summed it up quite nicely #ThingsICanDoWithR550 https://t.co/FuuKY0z0W5 &mdash; Thulani Mokwabona (@ThulzyThulz) April 20, 2017 #ThingsIcanDoWithR550 get a 10th row seat at bushiri&#39;s church &mdash; Andile Ace Mhlongo (@Andilemhlongo) April 20, 2017 I&#39;d buy back the land #ThingsIcanDoWithR550 &mdash; Sbu Gama (@SibusisoGama3) April 20, 2017 #ThingsIcanDoWithR550 this girl must come to kasi, this cut is less than 100 Haibo. pic.twitter.com/zRjWrxBRqF &mdash; Thabang Calvyntl (@Calvyntl) April 20, 2017 ALSO READ: Khanyi Mbau joins the haters, likens herself to Shoprite chicken thighs &nbsp; For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
