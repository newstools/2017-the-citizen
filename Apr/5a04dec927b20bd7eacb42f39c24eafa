Fashionista and reality star Uyanda Mbuli has been off our screens for a while. The last we heard of her was when she and her former partner in fashion Gert -Johan Coetzee ended their partnership in Diamond Face Couture. She is back with a reality show letting us into her exuberant life. Her reality show airs every Wednesday at 9pm on SABC3. And as per usual Twitter had a thing or two to say about last night&#8217;s show. Instead of fighting back, she responded to the hate with a stream of positive tweets. We live in a society filled w/negativity.. People refuse to give what should be freely given: &quot;SUPPORT&quot;. The main mission is to discourage. &mdash; Uyanda Mbuli (@UyandaM) April 19, 2017 If our main mission is to discourage, then we are serving the master of HATE &amp; DISTRACTION? Is the master of GOODWILL that irrelevant to us? &mdash; Uyanda Mbuli (@UyandaM) April 19, 2017 Mbuli funded her own reality show because she says she wants it to broadcast all over the world. Many have their productions companies but it is not everyone who can say they own and have funded their own TV shows in South Africa. It&#8217;s more or less unheard of. In a society where young girls settle for good looks, inspirational women such as her are important. Writing her own comeback story, funded by herself?? Without any support? Can you say GIRL POWER?!! #UyandaMbuli &mdash; TheCakeMeka (@JustMeka_) April 19, 2017 We need more people like #UyandaMbuli that will stop at nothing to achieve their hopes and dreams. &mdash; Sheldon Cameron (@Sheldon_Cameron) April 19, 2017 Let people like #UyandaMbuli inspire you to go ahead and not let obstacles get in your way of doing what you want to do. &mdash; Sheldon Cameron (@Sheldon_Cameron) April 19, 2017 Let people like #UyandaMbuli inspire you to go ahead and not let obstacles get in your way of doing what you want to do. &mdash; Sheldon Cameron (@Sheldon_Cameron) April 19, 2017 All her struggles made her stronger. Now she&#39;s on her path to represent us internationally. Take notes. Learn from her. #UyandaMbuli &mdash; Your soulmate (@obakeeng__) April 19, 2017 #UyandaMbuli is a role model to so many young and upcoming black female entrepreneurs, i feel like we lack so many in this department &mdash; #TheHandOfSas (@SasTheScientist) April 19, 2017 For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
