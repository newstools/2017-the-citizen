Former Proteas coach Gary Kirsten will be in charge of the Hobart Hurricanes for the next two Australian Big Bash T20 League seasons, the club announced on Monday. The 49-year-old came out on top after an extensive recruitment process involving a panel including Tasmanian cricketing greats Ricky Ponting and David Boon. &#8220;I am committed to developing the young T20 talent within the club and the region - at the same time creating the best environment for our leaders and experienced players to perform their best,&#8221; Kirsten said in a statement. &#8220;I have thoroughly enjoyed watching BBL over the past few years and I&#8217;m really looking forward to this coaching opportunity with the Hurricanes and Tasmania.&#8221; Kirsten played 101 Tests and 185 one-day internationals for South Africa before coaching India to the 2011 World Cup. He was then convinced to return to South Africa and enjoyed much success with the Proteas Test side under Graeme Smith. Merely a year into his tenure, the national side moved to the No 1 spot on the official Test team rankings. Kirsten currently runs his own cricket academy in Cape Town. Hurricanes general manager Bill Avery said the panel was impressed with his thorough and strategic approach and his vision for the club. The team are yet to finalise their remaining coaching support staff or squad for with discussions ongoing over coming weeks. For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
