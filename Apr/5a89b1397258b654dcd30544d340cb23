One person was killed and four people were left critical in an accident involving three cars on the R305 road near Rooigrond in the North West Province on Friday afternoon, the provincial government s community safety department said. According to a statement from the Bokone Bophirima (North West) government, a sedan, with an expired license disc, collided head-on with a Botswana-registered SUV. It is alleged that the RunX, traveling from Lichtenburg to Mahikeng was overtaking a number of vehicles at the time of collision along the barrier line at a road construction, the statement said. The third car involved in the accident, was a white Ford ST, which unfortunately, in an attempt to avoid collision veered off the road, disembarked badly onto incomplete lowered gravel surface area. The driver of the RunX was declared dead on the scene and his four passengers sustained serious injuries. They were rushed to the Mahikeng Provincial Hospital for treatment. The driver and passengers of the other two vehicles sustained slight injuries. Police opened a case of culpable homicide. The province s Safety and Transport Management MEC, Mpho Motlhabane, later made his way to the scene and said: This tragedy is indeed an indictment of our efforts to reduce fatalities and blatant disobedience of the rules of the road. Unfortunately, whilst we are doing our best to reduce lawlessness on the road, motorists and passengers should do their part to remind one another that: speed kills, unroadworthy cars are a hazard, reckless driving is forbidden, drinking and driving is not allowed, take a comfort rest and leg stretches every 200 km or 2 hours of the trip.
