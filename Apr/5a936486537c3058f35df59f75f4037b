Five men who allegedly raped a 34-year-old woman and then doused her and her male friend with a flammable liquid before callously setting them alight on Thursday withdrew their bail applications at the Kagiso Magistrate s Court, where an angry crowd was baying for their blood. The lawyers for Bheki Mzama, 28, Sabatha Mathuku, 30, Lindokhule Thembani, 23, Thamsanqa Sizama, 22, and Lindani Mzama,22, told the magistrate that after consultations the accused had decided to withdraw their bail applications. The accused face two counts of murder, rape, two counts of kidnapping and negligent and reckless driving.

They gang allegedly raped Cindi before they doused her and Buthelezi with a flammable liquid before setting them alight. Buthelezi succumbed to his injuries and died on the scene. Cindi, who also suffered severe burns, died at the hospital. On Thursday, the accused told the court through their legal representatives they had been assaulted while in custody. However, State prosecutor Myner Mokoakoa dismissed the submission of the accused. This is not their first appearance in court, why did they not mention this to the court on their previous appearance? The public gallery was filled with Tshepisong community members whose anger directed at the accused was palpable. The matter was adjourned to 2 June. Outside the court, Clowy Cindi, the sister of the murdered woman, said she was pleased the accused had withdrawn their bail applications. They were clever and knew the community would hunt them down if they were released on bail, said Cindy.
