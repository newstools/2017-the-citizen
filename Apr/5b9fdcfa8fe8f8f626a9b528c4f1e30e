The outpourings of agonised sympathy across the nation which have greeted the tragic deaths of 18 children, a driver and another adult who died in a horror collision between a minibus taxi and a truck near Bronkhorstspruit over the weekend, have been heartrending. The minibus burst into flames, burning many of the victims so badly that officials estimate it will take some time before they are all identified. It is right and just that a nation should feel this deeply about a tragedy which has devastated the families and friends of the deceased. But the question that still has to be asked is how an overloaded vehicle some estimates say about 34 passengers were crammed into the 22-seater was allowed to operate. If these estimates are to be given credence, the numbers are way over any tolerances and might have severely influenced any normal safety factors. Our roads are lethal enough without these constraints being enforced with all the strictness they deserve; though said in hindsight, this provides little relief for the bereaved. The days of transporting unsuspecting passengers especially children crammed together like undervalued cattle, must cease. And cease immediately. 20 learners die in minibus accident For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
