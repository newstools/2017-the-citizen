Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa will on Sunday join thousands of congregants and church members of the St Engenas Zion Christian Church in a prayer service at Moria in Limpopo to celebrate Easter Sunday, the presidency said. Ramaphosa is the patron of the Moral Regeneration Movement aimed at instilling high moral values in South African society with particular reference to the youth and as part of contributing to social cohesion and the building of a peaceful, non-racial, non-sexist democratic society, his spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa said. In this regard, the Christian church and indeed the entire religious formations of our country have and continue to play a major role in efforts aimed at the reconstruction and development of the soul of our South African society and thus assist in laying a firm foundation for a caring society and the creation of a better life for all South Africans, he said. We believe that only working jointly and collectively with various sectors of our society, including religious formations, can we tackle the social ills that are currently afflicting our society. Indeed as South Africa our history is replete with examples of how in acting in unison and collectively we have been able to tackle and triumph over issues that may have appeared intractable. As Deputy President Ramaphosa joins the St Engenas ZCC prayer service his thoughts and prayers will reach out to all other denominations across the country that will equally be joined in spirit in celebrating Easter Sunday. Ramaphosa would also take the opportunity to remind those who would be returning home following the Easter holidays to drive carefully, co-operate with the law enforcement agencies, observe the rules of the road, and ensure they arrive alive, Mamoepa said.
