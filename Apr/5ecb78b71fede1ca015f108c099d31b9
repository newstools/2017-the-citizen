Cassper has opened a clothing store in Newtown, Johannesburg, where he is selling merchandise. At the launch of the store during the week, he told Zkhiphani.com that the most expensive item in the store was a pair of sneakers he originally bought for R20 000. &#8220;This pair of shoes is called the Maison Martin Margiela, when I bought it, it was R20 000, and I performed with it at The Dome. So on that night I was wearing it for the very first time. I also wore it for the Zulu girls&#8217; video, and I haven&#8217;t worn it since. &#8220;This is the most expensive item in the shop. If you are a baller, come down and look at this shoe. I don&#8217;t know if you will buy it to wear it, but it will be a piece that the first time an African act filled up The Dome in that shoe,&#8221; said Cassper.
