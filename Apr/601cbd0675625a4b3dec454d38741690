In a statement on Saturday, EFF spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi said &#8220;the news reported on the fake news website Global News, that the CIC&#8217;s family has been involved in a car accident are fake&#8221;. &#8220;We would like to reiterate categorically that CIC&#8217;s family is safe and enjoying the Easter weekend in peace. &#8220;We encourage all people to reject Global News (www.globalnews360.com) website as a fake news site that should never be trusted or relied on for genuine news.&#8221; The website had reported that Malema and his wife and seven-month-old son died in an accident in Sandton after clipping the rear of a tipper truck. According to Sunday Sun, sources in the EFF believe such reports are created to &#8220;destabilise&#8221; their party. One EFF member told the tabloid &#8220;only God knows [Malema&#8217;s] lifespan&#8221;.
