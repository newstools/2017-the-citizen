Cricket South Africa&#8217;s high performance manager, Vinnie Barnes, is optimistic about the contribution Wayne Parnell will make for the Proteas in future. The left-arm quick, a stalwart of the Cape Cobras, will represent Kent in this season&#8217;s English domestic campaign.

When he represented the Cape Cobras for a full season, it made a massive difference. At Kent he&#8217;ll play regularly.&#8221; &nbsp; Injuries have hampered Parnell in the past, affecting his action. But his absence from the playing field also meant certain coaches didn&#8217;t have the faith to pick him regularly when he was available. As a result, it affected his confidence. However, when Parnell has been backed, it would seem he flourishes. In his first full domestic season back in 2015/2016, Parnell produced three successive five-wicket hauls for the Cape Cobras in the last two Sunfoil Series matches of the season. It included a 7/51 at Newlands against the Dolphins. Barnes is adamant Parnell should be considered an opening bowler. &#8220;To me, Wayne is a strike bowler who should open the bowling, operate at 142 km/h, hit the right areas and operate with good control,&#8221; he said. &#8220;He can use bounce very effectively not only as a dot ball but as a way to remove batsmen.&#8221; Vernon Philander&#8217;s stint for Sussex is also an ideal move, especially since the Proteas will play in 10 international games from May to August, including four Tests. Barnes, a former Proteas bowling coach, isn&#8217;t concerned about the stocky seamer only bowling around 125km/h in last month&#8217;s Test series against New Zealand. &#8220;Look, Vernon is a very clever bowler who assesses conditions fast on different tracks and knows what is needed to remove batsmen. Of course, he can bowl in the 130 s, there is no doubt at all about that fact.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter. &nbsp;
