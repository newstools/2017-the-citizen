We know it&#8217;s not that deep, considering South Africa has more serious issues right now, such as Khanyi Mbau&#8217;s pink skin and Nasty C&#8217;s Female Artist of the Year nomination at the Samas, but Rebecca Malope and SABC1&#8217;s show Friends Like These are the reasons people have trust issues. Though she has mentioned this a long time ago, so many South Africans did not know that &#8216;Rebecca&#8217; is a stage name. One Twitter user has caused a stir after somehow finding out that the gospel legend&#8217;s real name is Batsogile Lovederia Malope. Now people on Twitter say they feel betrayed by this &#8216;revelation&#8217;. However, some are having none of it as they say they don&#8217;t recognise Batsogile. &#8220;I bet even God knows her as &#8216;Rebecca Malope&#8217; not Batsogile Lovederia Malope,&#8221; one said, while others questioned if our country is even called South Africa. Another fan was faced with a dilemma after revealing she had named her child after Rebecca. What must happen now? Check out some of the reactions on Twitter below: @tshepo_hope1 @gigi_gao_ I named my daughter Rebecca because of her. eish now I must change her name. &mdash; Africa ke ya Rona (@mangaung73) April 20, 2017 @gigi_gao_ I&#39;m soo hurt right now pic.twitter.com/XYlTQVzV0f &mdash; Godfather (@irvin_stunna) April 20, 2017 @gigi_gao_ Yho pic.twitter.com/flPEz9C5Cv &mdash; Lusapho Libosh Gqobo (@LusaphoGqobo) April 19, 2017 @gigi_gao_ Issa Lie pic.twitter.com/uOFguR5muA &mdash; Odirile Mariri (@Odi_Mariri) April 19, 2017 @gigi_gao_ @Malcolm_Munyaza pic.twitter.com/dwocbizVru &mdash; iccy.isak (@iccy_isak) April 19, 2017 @gigi_gao_ I don&#39;t know what life has for me anymore pic.twitter.com/p4KDjuT1RP &mdash; Pineapples on Pizza (@walter_sentsho) April 19, 2017 @gigi_gao_ @MhlangaKudzayi Is the German cut even real? pic.twitter.com/iHkVPIiR8m &mdash; Anelisa Ndungane (@EyFresh) April 19, 2017 Rebecca is not alone in this. Friends Like These has been lying to us all this time. In the Face to Face challenge, where the five friends are asked questions about each other, apparently all those five cylinders that appear from the table have the same questions. To make things worse, there is no computerised machine that pushes all those cylinders. According to a photo that has been circulating on Facebook, there is literally a human being who sits under the table and pushes those cylinders. Check out the picture below: Facebook user Thapelo Thubisi confirmed this after posting a picture of himself with his friends on the same show and said the guy was right there. Now only one question remains: Is this Andile?
