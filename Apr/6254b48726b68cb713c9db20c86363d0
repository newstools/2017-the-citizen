Trainer Tony Nassif does not come to KwaZulu-Natal too often but when he does, he rarely leaves empty handed. With that in mind, Icy Avalanche could be the horse to follow in Race 6, a MR 62 Handicap over 2000m on the Greyville Polytrack on Friday night. Already successful twice in raids to Greyville, the Western Winter gelding has proven his liking for the Polytrack. He also had his current rider, apprentice Mpumelelo Mjoka, in the irons when Icy Avalanche won over this course and distance in December last year. His dangers look to be Smart World, Cuduiari and Night Lock. Earlier on the card in Race 1, a Maiden Plate over 1200m, Alison Wright-trained and Anthony Delpech-ridden He s A Keeper appears the one to beat. This Pathfork two-year-old has had two promising runs in his last two starts. At Scottsville in March He s A Keeper finished third, only 0.75 lengths behind Arianos Bagofgold and then followed up with another decent effort when having his first start on the Polytrack, finishing a 0.75-length third behind Sniper Shot. Both those runs were over 1000m and the step up in distance is expected to suit the gelding. He also has the advantage of jumping from pole position.
