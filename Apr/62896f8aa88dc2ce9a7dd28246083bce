President Jacob Zuma supporter businessman Kenny Kunene wrote on Facebook and Twitter on Tuesday night that at least one good thing has come out of the anti-Zuma protests, and that&#8217;s that South Africans have been more physically active. He said that &#8220;Discovery Vitality should send goodies to Pres. Zuma for making their members engage in physical activity. They must be fit now #ZumaRules.&#8221; Kunene has been scathing in his dismissal of the marchers and other people opposed to Zuma. He went as far as to call for NGOs to be banned in South Africa similar to how &#8220;His Execellency R.Mugabe (sic)&#8221; did so, &#8220;because they r used by regime change agents&#8221;. He said the judiciary also required &#8220;radical transformation&#8221;. He endorsed a tweet by BLF leader Andile Mngxitama calling opposition party members wanting Zuma to resign &#8220;the bodyguards of settler white monopoly capital&#8221;. Kunene wished the president well on his birthday last week and wrote: &#8220;President Zuma please DO NOT RESIGN coz you&#8217;ll be handing us over to stooges of international intelligence agencies. Please STAY. We Love U.&#8221; The one-time convicted Ponzi scheme mastermind had earlier said that only &#8220;stupid blacks&#8221; would march against Zuma. &#8220;Stupid Blacks will march for a white @Our_DA agenda but won&#8217;t march for the plight of fellow Blacks. Zuma is going nowhere #ZumaRules.&#8221; Kunene also retweeted this photo of an ANC member with a firearm allegedly on her way to defend Luthuli House from the DA on April 7, warning: &#8220;BE WARNED: You go to the march on Friday at your own PERIL.Just read that 600 COMBAT READY MK SOLDIERS from KZN are coming to Jozi. SCARY!!!&#8221; Defend Luthuli House by all means&#8230;This country cannot go back to colonialists NOOOOOOOOO NEVER. pic.twitter.com/f1nQMFXV6C &mdash; Kenny Kunene (@Kenny_T_Kunene) April 7, 2017 Kunene&#8217;s transformation from being an ardent critic of Zuma&#8217;s in 2013 to one of his biggest defenders now could not be more drastic. In an open letter to the president that went viral in June of that year, he had written: &#8220;In public you smile and laugh, but in truth you behave like a monster, a tyrant who will target perceived enemies ruthlessly, and because of that fear few dare to speak openly.&#8221; He also wrote: &#8220;The Gupta issue alone should be the last straw for many South Africans. But the extent of how much the Gupta family controls you, and by implication this country, has not even begun to be understood.&#8221;
