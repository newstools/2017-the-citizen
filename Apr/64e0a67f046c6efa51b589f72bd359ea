Leader of Incredible Happenings Ministries Pastor Paseka &#8216;Mboro&#8217; Motsoeneng has accused the Absa in Alberton, Ekurhuleni, of mistreating him on Tuesday. He said he went there to claim his money back, as the bank had allegedly processed illegal debit orders and fees he never agreed to. After confronting the bank staff, Mboro claimed security guards kicked him out and stopped him from entering again. Mboro told Daily Sun the problem began in 2012 when he changed from a small business account to a medium business account to avoid cheques, a transition that cost him nearly R1 million. Changing accounts was the beginning of questionable transactions and debit orders that the bank does not seem to care about, said Mboro. Mboro has reportedly opened cases of intimidation, harassment and fraud at Alberton Police Station. The cops confirmed the cases to the tabloid. Absa&#8217;s relations manager, Liezl Squier, told the tabloid that the bank was investigating the matter and would view the CCTV footage to find out what really happened. However, the process would take some time, she said. Also read: I didn&#8217;t take Lundi to heaven, says Pastor Mboro &nbsp;
