An unexploded Second World War bomb has been found in London&#8217;s River Thames near the start of Sunday&#8217;s Oxford-Cambridge Boat Race, police said on Saturday. &#8220;Police were called by a member of the public at approximately 1.50 pm (1250 GMT) on Saturday reporting what they thought to be World War Two ordnance on the Chelsea shoreline by Putney Bridge,&#8221; said a Scotland Yard spokesman. &#8220;Officers including the Marine Policing Unit attended. The item is currently submerged.&#8221; Thousands of people are due to line the banks of the Thames to watch the 163rd edition of the annual contest between the two British universities, which involves men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s races. Police said they were working with the race organisers. The event is expected to go ahead as planned.
