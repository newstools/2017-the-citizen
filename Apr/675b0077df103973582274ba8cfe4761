Police Minister Fikile Mbalula has come out defending comments he made during his media briefing in Pretoria on Tuesday afternoon. Responding to reports saying he instructed South Africans to download Tbo Touch&#8217;s Touch HD app, Mbalula said he was misquoted. The minister said he only used the app as an example of the one he wanted his ministry to have to make it easier for people to report cases. There are many apps. You know there is an app that we download everyday it s called Touch HD, it s a radio station. I want you to download that app on your cellphones to fight criminality. So when you enter a zone it must tell you how many police stations you got and what the dangers you are facing in the area that you are at. Use your cellphone to report criminality. That s what I am about, he said. But when reports said he had instructed people to download the app, Mbalula said he only used it as an example.
