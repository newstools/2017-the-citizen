His latest victory on home soil will give him a significant boost for the rest of a lengthy season, wheelchair tennis player Lucas Sithole believes, after the local ace reclaimed his SA Open title at Ellis Park on Friday. In a match that was stretched overnight, after the contest was suspended due to rain, Sithole defeated Israel s Itay Erenlib 6-2 6-4 and regained the title he last won in 2015. It was important for me to win as I got a lot of rankings points &#8230; so it was a good opportunity for me, which I grabbed with both hands, said Sithole, who won the US Open in 2013. The 30-year-old player, a former world No 2, said he was geared up for a whirlwind international season. This brings a lot of confidence because there s still a long way to go in the season, he said. I have the Japan Open, and then tours of Korea and France coming up, so winning today is going to give me that confidence going forward. Meanwhile, in the men s singles final at Ellis Park, Swedish player Stefan Olsson claimed his first SA Open title, making a career breakthrough with his maiden ITF Super Series victory. He secured a 6-4 6-2 win over Great Britain s Gordon Reid, the Paralympic champion. In the all-Dutch showdown for the women s singles title, Diede de Groot emerged as another firsttime SA Open champion, defeating compatriot Marjolein Buis 6-1 6-0. The duo then teamed up to win the women s doubles title, beating Sabine Ellerbrock of Germany and Charlotte Famin of France 6-4 6-2 in the final.
