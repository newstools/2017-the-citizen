Truth be told, the current generation of Mercedes-Benz s A Class and CLA models still have the good looks and aren&#8217;t ready for a complete replacement. This said, the Stuttgart-based automaker has plans to introduce an A Class sedan to the range. The Germans didn t only travel to this year s Auto Shanghai to showcase their refreshed S-Class set for next year but also took to the show to debut their Concept A Sedan. . The concept is aimed at giving the motoring world a potential look into the future for entry-level shoppers seeking a path to Mercedes ownership. Our Concept A Sedan shows that the time of creases is over, said Gorden Wagener, Chief Design Officer Daimler AG in a press release. With its perfect proportions and a sensual treatment of surfaces with reduced lines, it is the next milestone of Sensual Purity and has the potential to introduce a new design era.&#8221; The Concept A Sedan takes a cautious-yet-attractive approach to the compact luxury segment. Short overhangs front and rear are complimented by large wheel arches that have the slightest of flair to accommodate 20-inch wheels. Despite Wagener s claim to the contrary, the concept does showcase some angular tendencies for both the front and rear lamps. The high belt line and arching roof are satisfyingly Mercedes, but it s not much of a stretch to see shades of a Mazda6 in the drooping front clip. . Mercedes offers no mention of potential engines or powertrain combinations. There s still no word if the A Class sedan will make it to our shores, since we already have the CLA Coupe that is based on the A Class hatchback.
