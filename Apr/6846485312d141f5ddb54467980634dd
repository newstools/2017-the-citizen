Indian batting great Sachin Tendulkar was known as the &#8220;Little Master&#8221;. Now he probably wants to be known as the &#8220;Little Artist&#8221; too. The 42-year-old, who scored a world record 34 000 international runs, this week released a catchy single that is sure to have his legion of fans hugely excited. In partnership with well-known Indian singer Sonu Nigam, Tendulkar has produced the &#8220;Cricket Wali Beat&#8221;. It&#8217;s a song that&#8217;s supposed to promote his new app 100MB, where all his social media accounts come together in one space. &#8220;He&#8217;s a very good singer. We did not use pitch corrector on his voice as he was singing in the right tone. Despite being a shy person, Sachin got extremely comfortable the moment I kind of increased the fun quotient while we were shooting the video,&#8221; Nigam told various news outlets. &#8220;I am glad to be part of Sachin&#8217;s new innings.&#8221; Our very own AB de Villiers, the Proteas one-day skipper, is also a talented singer and has released various songs previously &#8211; including the hit Maak Jou Drome Waar (Make your dreams come true).
