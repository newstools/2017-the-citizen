by Barnaby CHESTERMAN United had several chances to kill off the tie after Henrikh Mkhitaryan&#8217;s first half opener from a tight angle but their failure to convert chances &#8212; a failing all season long &#8212; came back to haunt them as Leander Dendoncker blasted home a header four minutes from time. &#8220;The result is positive,&#8221; insisted Mourinho, with the second leg at Old Trafford to come next week. &#8220;I think the result should be much better, we can only blame ourselves. &#8220;We have an easy game to play in the second half and we didn&#8217;t &#8212; we lost the ball easily. &#8220;We made sloppy decisions, we had sloppy touches on the ball and then we gave them opportunities to have counter-attacks.&#8221; Mourinho praised the defence which had stood firm until Dendoncker&#8217;s late run wasn&#8217;t tracked, allowing the strapping midfielder to rise above Matteo Darmian and Marcus Rojo to power home a header. &#8220;It was a strong performance for them, from the defence,&#8221; said Mourinho. &#8220;They did defensively what we asked them to do.&#8221; But with centre-backs Chris Smalling and Phil Jones injured, Mourinho complained that Eric Bailly and Rojo will have to shoulder the burden of every match until the end of the season. &#8220;There&#8217;s nothing I can do, they have to go until the end. There&#8217;s no other chance, we don&#8217;t have any other central defenders.&#8221; Mourinho was less impressed with his forwards, who squandered many attacking positions and have managed only 19 goals in their 11 Europa League matches this season. &#8220;The decisions were wrong, the only one that was right was Paul&#8217;s (Pogba) shot &#8212; a good save by the keeper,&#8221; moaned the Portuguese boss. &#8220;This has happened all season.&#8221; Asked why his team are still struggling to score goals, Mourinho was at a loss. &#8220;Good question, difficult answer,&#8221; he said. United captain Michael Carrick echoed his manager&#8217;s feelings with a brutally honest assessment of the team&#8217;s shortcomings. &#8220;It&#8217;s frustrating. We were so in control but got sloppy, we have to kill teams off,&#8221; he told BT Sport. &#8220;We should have won that game. They had one chance and scored a header. &#8220;We need to be more ruthless, it&#8217;s as simple as that. We were too comfortable. We got sloppy. &#8220;It&#8217;s not the end of the world but we are better than that. It&#8217;s that little edge that makes the difference in the end, but we&#8217;ll look forward to the next game.&#8221; Anderlecht coach Rene Weiler said the late equaliser had kept his side&#8217;s hopes of progressing alive. &#8220;We always believe, it&#8217;s always our aim to win,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We know it will be a hard game in Manchester. We&#8217;ll fight for it, we still have chances &#8212; qualification is still open.&#8221; The Belgian champions came on strong in the second half having been holding on at times in the first period. But Weiler said his team hadn&#8217;t been overawed at the start. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think we were timid, we had courage, we played well, we competed well,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They kept the ball well but that&#8217;s due to them, not because we were timid.&#8221;
