Tabloid papers were on Sunday making a meal of rumours that Tsonga disco king Penny Penny had been involved in a punch-up with Lawrence Usibi, the station manager of Munghana Lonene FM. According to sources who spoke to both Sunday Sun and Sunday World, the reality TV star and musician pushed Usibi around and may even have punched or tried to punch him at the 14th Xitsonga Music Awards at Giyani Stadium, Limpopo, last weekend. Penny Penny acknowledges confronting both Usibi and kwaito star Arthur Mafokate, but denies punching anyone. Sunday World alleges the reason was due to Ubisi &#8220;making him strip half naked in public&#8221; as Penny Penny was allegedly not allocated a change room and not given food. The musician apparently alleged the radio station discriminates against him due to his reality show (Pappa Penny Ahee) deal with DStv. According to Sunday Sun, his band was apparently also denied entry to the stadium due to not being accredited. The &#8220;furious&#8221; Penny Penny allegedly also lost his cool with Mafokate, threatening to &#8220;moer him&#8221;, for allegedly trying to take to the stage before him. Mafokate denied knowing anything about being physically threatened. SABC spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago told Sunday Sun that Penny Penny had indeed been unhappy, but he had managed to calm the musician down. Sunday World reports that a witness told them Penny Penny &#8220;stormed the stage and stood there while Mafokate was performing&#8221; since Penny Penny had been about to perform his hit song Mniki only to see Mafokate take to the stage &#8220;as he wanted to rush back to Joburg&#8221;. Ubusi told Sunday Sun the matter was &#8220;water under the bridge&#8221;, but Sunday World reports that, had it not been for the Mopani mayor shielding Mafokate, the disco king would have given a &#8220;possible beating&#8221; to the kwaito king.
