Ten people died in an accident on the N2 at Umzumbe, near Port Shepstone on Monday, the Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) said. The crash happened at around 6.45pm on Monday April 17, 2017, and involved three Toyota Quantum type vehicles. It is alleged that the drivers of two Toyota Quantums were travelling in a southerly direction when the other Toyota Quantum that was driving in a northerly tried to overtake where the road merges and sideswiped the approaching vehicle, spokesperson Simon Zwane said. The vehicle tried to avoid the crash but collided with other vehicle that was travelling in front of it. The precise cause of the crash is still being investigated. A case of culpable homicide will be investigated. He said that the RTMC was also probing the bus accident that claimed 15 lives at Ntunjambili, near Nkandla three days ago.
