A Metallica cover band distraught after its equipment was stolen has been able to return to stage after a gift from surprise benefactors the metal legends themselves. Blistered Earth, a four-piece band from Spokane, Washington that covers Metallica classics and emulates the group&#8217;s headbanging look, said a trailer with all its gear was snatched after a show last week in Portland, Oregon. After two days, the band which lost three guitars, two bass guitars and a drum-kit plus an array of amplifiers and pedals said everything had been replaced. &#8220;Sometimes when bad things happen it really brings out the best in people,&#8221; Blistered Earth wrote on Facebook. James Hetfield &#8220;and the rest of the guys in Metallica (thanx guys) have seen fit to replace our equipment. Thank you guys!!&#8221; There was no immediate word from Metallica. The band on May 10 begins in Baltimore an extensive tour of North America and Europe after completing a leg in Latin America. sct/bbk Agence France-Presse
