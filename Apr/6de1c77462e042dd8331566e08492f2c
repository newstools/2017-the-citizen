The European Union needs a &#8220;serious British response&#8221; to its demands to protect citizens&#8217; rights after Brexit before talks on future ties can begin, EU President Donald Tusk said Saturday. &#8220;We need real guarantees for our people to live, work and study in the UK and the same goes for the Brits&#8221; who live in Europe, Tusk told reporters after a summit where the leaders of the remaining 27 EU countries agreed their Brexit negotiating guidelines. &#8220;We need a serious British response,&#8221; the former Polish premier said. &#8220;I want to assure you that as soon as Britain gives real guarantees for our citizens, we will find a solution rapidly,&#8221; Tusk said.
