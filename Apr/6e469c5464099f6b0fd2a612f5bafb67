by Kieran CANNING Cristiano Ronaldo scored a hat-trick to become the first man to score 100 Champions League goals as holders Madrid completed a 4-2 win on Tuesday, going through 6-3 on aggregate. However, the Portuguese&#8217;s second and third goals were offside, whilst visitors Bayern had Arturo Vidal sent off five minutes from the end of normal time. &#8220;I think we deserved more,&#8221; fumed Ancelotti. &#8220;There are decisions that have penalised us a lot. &#8220;The (red) card for Arturo wasn&#8217;t a card and then the two goals from Cristiano are offside so clearly we are not happy. &#8220;In a quarter-final you have to put a better referee, or it is the moment to introduce video refereeing, which is what UEFA are trying, because there are too many errors.&#8221; Bayern have now been eliminated in four straight seasons by Spanish sides. But they threatened to overturn a 2-1 first-leg deficit as Robert Lewandowski&#8217;s penalty and Sergio Ramos&#8217;s own goal either side of Ronaldo&#8217;s first took the game to extra time at the Santiago Bernabeu. However, Bayern&#8217;s numerical disadvantage told after Vidal saw his second yellow card and Ronaldo made the most of an assistant referee&#8217;s leniency to complete his hat-trick. The 21-year-old Marco Asensio rounded off the scoring with a sensational solo effort. &#8220;If the referee didn&#8217;t make mistakes we don&#8217;t know what would have happened,&#8221; added Ancelotti, who was returning to the Bernabeu for the first time since being sacked as Real boss in 2015. &#8220;Many times in decisions there are doubts, here there is no doubt. You didn&#8217;t need a replay to see Arturo touched the ball.&#8221; Madrid boss and Ancelotti&#8217;s former assistant Zinedine Zidane had a different version of events as both Bayern&#8217;s goals also came about in controversial fashion. Casemiro was harshly penalised when Arjen Robben tumbled inside the Madrid box, whilst Lewandowski was also offside in the build-up to Ramos&#8217;s own goal. &#8220;The referee has a very hard job,&#8221; said Zidane. &#8220;They have told me their second goal was also offside. It goes both ways, that is football.&#8221; &#8211; &#8216;Don&#8217;t boo me&#8217; &#8211; Madrid were once again grateful to Ronaldo&#8217;s killer touch as the four-time World Player of the Year was pivotal in both legs against Bayern. And the Portuguese once again rounded on his critics after a restless Bernabeu crowd got on his back for an error-strewn first-half display. &#8220;The only thing I ask is that they don&#8217;t boo me because I give my best in every game,&#8221; Ronaldo told Spanish TV station Antena 3. &#8220;Although I don&#8217;t always score, I always work hard and try to help Real Madrid.&#8221; Victory also secured history on a collective level for Madrid as they reached the semi-finals for a record seventh straight year. &#8220;To score six goals against a team like Bayern Munich isn&#8217;t easy, so we deserved to go through,&#8221; added Ronaldo. &#8220;Maybe they will not whistle him any more,&#8221; said Zidane in defence of his star man. &#8220;In the end he shows what he can do on the pitch, what very few players can do. &#8220;In the key moments he is always there. He scored three goals. &#8220;The fans will always appreciate Cristiano for all he has done here.&#8221;
