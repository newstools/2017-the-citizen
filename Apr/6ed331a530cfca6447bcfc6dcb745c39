Since then, he has been tweeting about reported crimes and the work police have been doing all over South Africa with the hashtag #WanyaTsotsi. But it seems he has been overdoing it, according to one follower, who told the minister to tone it down, asking him if he was going to tweet every time he did his job.

Please turn on your location.&#8221; She failed to follow Mbalula&#8217;s instruction, as she deleted her tweet. Also read: Wanya tsotsi, says Mbalula as he celebrates his appointment
