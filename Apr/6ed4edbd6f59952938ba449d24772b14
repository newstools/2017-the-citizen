People understood to be apart of Zuma&#8217;s inner circle and who are included in an exclusive Whatsapp group called the &#8216;Black Empowerment Foundation&#8217; were told by Edward Zuma that Gordhan was definitely going to be fired during the Cabinet reshuffle which took place almost two weeks ago. According to Sunday Times, Edward said: &#8220;That one is definitely going Rand or not he is out.&#8221; He said this at 9pm two Thursdays ago, while speculation was still rife on Pravin Gordhan&#8217;s axing. It was eventually announced at 12 am that Gordhan and his deputy, Mcebisi Jonas would no longer serve in Zuma&#8217;s administration. The Whatsapp group consists of Water and Sanitation Minister Nomvula Mokonyane, SAA chairperson Dudu Myeni, Communications Minister Ayanda Dlodlo among others. Gordhan has previously said that he found out about his axing on TV along with the rest of millions of South Africans who were informed. He said he had not been consulted or told beforehand and in an interview with eNCA a day before being fired he confidently said he had not resigned and to his knowledge was still the minister of finance. Edward Zuma has been a fierce critic of Gordhan and downplayed the junk status announcement made by credit rating agencies following his axing. &#8220;Am going to celebrate this grading decision tonight long overdue hence mama action they must go now these people really now. &#8220;Brics is the only way out of this hell on Earth. They did us a favour really,&#8221; he said after it was confirmed SA was downgraded to junk status.
