President Jacob Zuma&#8217;s wife, Thobeka Madiba-Zuma, celebrated her birthday on Sunday and shared a few pictures of the glamourous birthday dinner. &#8220;Thank you Lord for the gift of life you have blessed me with, could not ask for more. I am thankful for every breath I take, I am perfectly aware that every time I take a breath someone somewhere loses it. Thank you for blessing me with the most wonderful family not to mention a husband, best friend, companion, father to my kids,&#8221; she wrote on Instagram. Among the attendees of the dinner was her husband and some MK veterans, who she thanked, saying her day would have been incomplete without them. &#8220;They gave birth to our freedom. Have so much respect for the hard earned MK Veteran Status.&#8221; Madiba-Zuma, who has never shied away from publicly while showing her affection for the president, on Sunday shared a sweet message to him. &#8220;Also have hubby to thank&#8230;There is one foundation in the world that no earthquake or tornado can shake the love of my husband. Thank you Msholozi.&#8221; Check out some of the pictures she shared on Instagram below: A post shared by TMZF Founder &amp; Patron (@firstladytzuma) on Apr 2, 2017 at 1:34pm PDT A post shared by TMZF Founder &amp; Patron (@firstladytzuma) on Apr 2, 2017 at 2:42pm PDT A post shared by TMZF Founder &amp; Patron (@firstladytzuma) on Apr 2, 2017 at 1:00pm PDT Would not have been the woman I am today if it was not for this wonderful soul.
