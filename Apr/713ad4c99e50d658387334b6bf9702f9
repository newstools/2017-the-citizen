It has been more than a year since the Constitutional Court ruled in favour of Nkosana Makate, the guy who invented Please Call Me for Vodacom. However, according to SowetanLive, Makate is yet to receive his money from the mobile company. Makate created the Please Call Me SMS service when he was still employed by Vodacom over a decade ago. Makate took Vodacom to court demanding 15% of the service s proceedings, and following the ConCourt victory, Justice Chris Jafta ordered Vodacom to start negotiating a suitable payout with Makate. &#8220;It&#8217;s been a long battle that has taken its toll on me and my family. I&#8217;m a soldier and I will never give up,&#8221; Makate said. Vodacom&#8217;s Byron Kennedy said: &#8220;Negotiations to determine reasonable compensation have resumed. Vodacom is hopeful that a settlement on the matter will be found soon.&#8221; Makate, who currently works as a financial director for the government, confirmed on Friday that he was talking with Vodacom alone. &#8220;I don&#8217;t have a lawyer. I am alone and I&#8217;m soldiering on. I have not appointed anyone to negotiate on my behalf,&#8221; he said. For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
