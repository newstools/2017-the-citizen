Secretary General of the South African Communist Party (SACP), Blade Nzimande, on Sunday reiterated his support for calls for Jacob Zuma to step down as president and further stated that the party would not support the ANC&#8217;s wrong decisions, just because they were allies. This is according to a report by TimesLive which quoted Nzimande as speaking at the party&#8217;s Chris Hani Commemoration event in Boksburg on Sunday. Nzimande was reportedly saying that Zuma&#8217;s stepping down from office would not be sufficient and that the &#8220;ANC will eat itself&#8221; if things continued as they were at present. News24 further reported that Nzimande said the call for the president to step down was not taken lightly nor was it personal, but rather it was a decision which they believed would be correct, although it would not address all of the ruling party&#8217;s problems. TimesLive quoted Nzimande as saying the state of affairs now was worse than in the lead-up to Polokwane in 2008, and the Gauteng chair of the party, Joe Mpisi, also said the SACP would do what was necessary if the ANC did not &#8220;self-correct&#8221;. Nzimande called on the working class to mobilise and that it was time for a big communist party to be built for the sake of the country, reported TimesLive. News24 quoted Nzimande as saying that the revolution would be lost if workers did not stand up now. #SACP #ChrisHaniMemorialLecture Dr Blade Nzimande addressing members at the Boksburg Civic Centre @ANN7tv pic.twitter.com/1SvJMdlKC4 &mdash; Tiisetso Matsietsa (@TiiWaMatsietsa) April 30, 2017 SACP supporters continue to fill up the Boksburg civic centre ahead of Blade Nzimande&#39;s address at the #ChrisHaniMemorialLecture #SABCNEWS pic.twitter.com/Iz7JCEG72i &mdash; Lopang Alamu (@LopangAlamu) April 30, 2017 SACP supporters lively ahead of #ChrisHani commemoration speech by Blade Nzimande in Boksburg. @TimesLIVE pic.twitter.com/XVhObVAxp8 &mdash; Kyle Cowan (@CowansView) April 30, 2017 For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter. &nbsp;
