The 11-year-old boy who was attacked by a tame lion while visiting his grandmother in Lephalale, is fighting for his life in hospital. Updating supporters, friends of the family, Adri and Herman, wrote on the boy s Facebook page: There is still swelling on the brain and the doctors cannot operate on his vertebrae until the swelling has subsided. There was a complication with his lungs this morning [Friday]. But it was quickly sorted out. While I read through everyone s messages this morning at the hospital, the reality came to me of how blessed we are in this time of need. A sadness came over me because I know that so many people are also going through a severe situation and do not have any support and even worse that do not know of God and do not know or believe in His grace. Lord fold these people in your arms. Amen, said the message. The boy had an MRI on Wednesday to determine if the swelling had left any damage, Last Saturday, he was rushed to a local hospital after the attack then later transferred to the Medi-Clinic Muelmed hospital in Pretoria Central. At the time, Chris Botha, spokesperson for Netcare 911 said the seriously injured boy had been airlifted to the Pretoria hospital.
