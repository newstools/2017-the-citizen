In case you haven&#8217;t noticed, Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema has lost weight and left many wondering how he did it. His weight loss has earned him body-shaming comments from none other than Minister of Social Development Bathabile Dlamini. Responding to his murmurs in parliament, Dlamini said: Okay shut up, you slender for nonsense. She later denied body-shaming him, saying she was just happy he lost weight.
