New Zealander Shaun Treeby will make his Super Rugby debut for the Stormers on Friday. Yet if you didn&#8217;t know the background story, you&#8217;d think Robbie Fleck, the Capetonians&#8217; coach, has timed the 28-year-old centre&#8217;s selection to be perfectly ironic. Also read: Super Rugby Reaction (W)Rap: Refund every single fan! The Stormers&#8217; opponents this week are the Highlanders, the franchise Treeby played 50 times for between 2011 and 2015. But Fleck isn&#8217;t picking him for good sports. He has to. With Dan du Plessis leaving the field early during the 57-24 loss to the Crusaders at the weekend with a dislocated shoulder, the Stormers now only have three fit centres. Juan de Jongh, Damian de Allende and Huw Jones are all experienced options Fleck currently doesn&#8217;t have at his disposal. Despite recruiting Treeby, the Stormers have &#8211; perhaps rightly &#8211; not used him as an excuse to ignore local rookies. In fact, the Kiwi has waited this long for an opportunity exactly for that reason. &#8220;We&#8217;ve made it a priority to give our younger centres a chance,&#8221; said Fleck on Monday. &#8220;Shaun has been brilliant in that regard. We wanted him to be a mentor for the younger guys and he&#8217;s guided them weekly.&#8221; But the need for the Stormers to get their campaign back on track after two successive losses makes Treeby an attractive option for short-term results. &#8220;We&#8217;re definitely going to use him, whether it be in the starting line-up or as replacement,&#8221; said Fleck. &#8220;He&#8217;s got a wealth of experience at Super Rugby level and he&#8217;s very much familiar with how the Highlanders play, for obvious reasons. I&#8217;m excited to see how he performs against his former teammates.&#8221; The Stormers will also be heartened by the news that SP Marais is ready to play following a groin strain. The fullback, unexpectedly recruited late last year as a free agent, has been sensational in this campaign. &#8220;He&#8217;s ready, we have him back,&#8221; said Fleck.
