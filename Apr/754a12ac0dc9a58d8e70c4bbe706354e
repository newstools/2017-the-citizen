The Save South Africa campaign on Thursday called for a weekend of prayer and reflection for South Africa. The campaign, which has actively called for President Jacob Zuma to step down, urged faith-based and interfaith organisations to intensify their commitment and support for activities carried out in defence of the country s democracy. Save SA said in a statement that organisations must organise dedicated services for South Africa s future wherever they go during the Easter period. Organisations are encouraged to broadcast their services and seek opportunities for broader coverage, such as via the internet, to encourage the participation of others. Faith-based organisations played a vital part in the transformation from apartheid to the birth of democracy in 1994, and we are at an equally crucial stage now &#8212; where the collective power of prayer and reflection is vital to get South Africa back onto the right path. The campaign also thanked organisations for their support during recent marches organised against Zuma. The mass support we have already seen by tens of thousands of South Africans is in response to deep disquiet at the erosion of our democracy. This is not a once-off event we need to remain united in ensuring that we fight the battle to root out corruption and looting, defend our democracy and protect our Constitution. Above all, we need to work towards reducing inequality, reducing unemployment and ensuring social justice for all our people.Let us all join together to save South Africa, the campaign said.
