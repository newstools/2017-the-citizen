South Africa will turn out in the promotion playoffs later this season after the national men&#8217;s tennis team romped to a commanding 5-0 victory over Slovenia in their Davis Cup Euro-Africa Group 2 second-round tie in Centurion at the weekend. With 20-year-old Lloyd Harris and Nik Scholtz having won their opening singles matches on Friday, in-form player Raven Klaasen and partner Ruan Roelofse took the doubles rubber on Saturday for an unassailable lead. The host nation were also triumphant in the reverse singles fixtures on Sunday. &#8220;I am extremely happy and proud of my team,&#8221; said SA captain Marcos Ondruska. &#8220;Everything worked for us this weekend and my players executed well and really lifted their games to the highest level I ve seen since taking over the captaincy. &#8220;The boys kept composed and put on a good show.&#8221; The SA squad set up a crucial tie against Denmark in September for a place in the top tier of the Euro-Africa division of the international team competition.
