While she took the board&#8217;s reasoning into account, Brown said she would not approve the large payout. According to EWN, Brown had rejected the proposed payout which was set to be given to Molefe despite him only serving 18 months at the helm of the parastatal. Brown had previously said she was unaware of the board&#8217;s decision and was not involved in operational issues at Eskom. According to a labour expert, who expressed concerns about the use of taxpayer money in what looked like a mutual settlement agreement , the amount appeared very irregular . If the payment was severance, it should have been no more than R15 million, and for it to be a pension payout, Molefe would have needed to be on a gross annual salary of R243 million a year. He &#8220;only&#8221; earned R8 million a year.
