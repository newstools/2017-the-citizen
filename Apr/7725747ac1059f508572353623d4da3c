by Pirate IRWIN The 26-year-old French midfielder saw off the likes of Tottenham striker Harry Kane and Everton&#8217;s marksman Romelu Lukaku for the prestigious award. It may well not be the last piece of silverware he lifts this season as unlike his former team-mates at Leicester &#8212; for whom he was the driving force of a stunning title success last year &#8212; he stands on the brink of becoming the first player to win successive league titles with different clubs. &#8220;To be chosen by the players to be player of the year means a lot to me,&#8221; said Kante. &#8220;It means the world to be chosen and it&#8217;s been two beautiful seasons, one with Leicester, and we are in good form with Chelsea. To be player of the year, it&#8217;s a great honour.&#8221; Kante, who also faces an FA Cup final date against Arsenal, said Chelsea manager Antonio Conte, like Leicester&#8217;s title winning manager Claudio Ranieri an Italian, had instilled a winning mentality into the players. &#8220;He knows what he wants from the players,&#8221; said Kante. &#8220;He wants to win, and we work very, very, very hard in training for him. He put a winning mentality into the squad, and everyone wants to give their best for the team, and to make Chelsea win titles.&#8221; Kante, who had a modest playing career in France with Boulogne and then Caen, said the award will not go to his head as he acknowledges they face a tough battle to win either the league or the Cup &#8212; Spurs are just four points behind them in the title race and Arsenal will be desperate to rescue a poor season with a trophy. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to fight for both competitions,&#8221; said Kante. &#8220;The cup is just one game, and the league six games, and we&#8217;re going to give our best to win these two competitions.&#8221; Kante&#8217;s performances this season has had former players eulogising about his ability especially after he totally overshadowed his compatriot and the world&#8217;s most expensive player Paul Pogba in the 1-0 win over Manchester United in March. &#8220;I&#8217;d go as far to say that he&#8217;s (Kante) the best central midfield player in the world on current form,&#8221; former England and Chelsea great Frank Lampard told the BBC. &#8220;Looking at the way he&#8217;s performing this year, he may not be scoring lots of goals but what he&#8217;s giving to the team in the way he&#8217;s playing, the driving force that he is, I cannot see anyone else out there in world football better than him at the moment.&#8221; Former Barcelona and England striker Gary Lineker said he had the potential to be the greatest midfielder of all time if he corrected one facet of his game. &#8220;Bloody hell, if Kante starts scoring goals as well he&#8217;ll become the best midfield player ever,&#8221; tweeted Lineker Tottenham Hotspur &#8212; who would relish the title even more after being beaten 4-2 by Chelsea in their FA Cup semi-final on Saturday &#8212; didn&#8217;t go away empty-handed. Their goalscoring midfielder English international Dele Alli, whom many thought should have been a contender for the senior award, won the young player of the year award for the second successive year. Other winners included Manchester City&#8217;s Lucy Bronze who was the women&#8217;s player of the year for a second occasion having won it in 2014. Birmingham City&#8217;s Jess Carter won the young player of the year award. English football icon Davd Beckham followed among another former Manchester United team-mate Ryan Giggs in receiving the PFA&#8217;s Merit award for his contribution to the game.
