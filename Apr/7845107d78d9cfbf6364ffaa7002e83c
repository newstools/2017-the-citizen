Eskom said on Friday it was confident about its current funding status though the cost of debt would increase following S&amp;P Global and Moody s rating agencies to lower the power supplier s credit rating and put it on review subsequently. Eskom chief financial officer Anoj Singh said that 72 percent of Eskom s current fiscal year s funding amounting to R72 billion would be secured by the end of April. Singh said the funding requirement for financial year 2017/18 was thus not compromised and was in line with the execution of Eskom s funding plan. We are confident that we will successfully execute Eskom s funding plan over the next five years backed by the availability of the government guarantees; the only challenge that Eskom will have to contend with will be the higher cost of debt, Eskom said. Singh s comments follow S&amp;P Global Ratings&#8217; announcement lowering Eskom s long-term corporate credit rating to B+ from BB-&#8216; following the ratings action on Monday to downgrade South Africa s long-term foreign currency rating credit to junk status . Meanwhile, Moody s Investor Services on Wednesday also announced their decision to place Eskom s Ba1 senior unsecured Medium Term Note rating on review for downgrade. The ratings agency has simultaneously placed Eskom s global scale corporate family rating and its national scale rating on review for downgrade. Moody s review decision on Eskom also follows the ratings agency s decision to place the Sovereign s Baa2 bond rating on review for downgrade on Monday.
