Speaking on SABC 3&#8242; s Real Talk with Anele, Metro FM breakfast show co-host and SA Idols judge Somizi Mhlongo opened up about his former relationship with TV host Bonang Matheba. &#8220;I loved that girl and still do and I never thought our friendship would die. She was my Lebo Mathosa,&#8221; said Mhlongo while answering a question from show host Anele Mdoda about who he thought owed him an apology. Matheba and Mhlongo&#8217;s friendship went south after she stopped talking to him. The rumour mill has it that Matheba believed Somizi had told DJ Zinhle about Matheba&#8217;s affair with her ex-boyfriend AKA. Mhlongo further went on to touch on how much he valued friendship and the love he gets from fans. When asked about his recent achievement of co-hosting the breakfast show with former 5FM drive host now Metro FM breakfast host DJ Fresh, Mhlongo responded by saying, &#8220;It is all the work of God; this is among the biggest blessings in my life and I know this because I was very nervous the Sunday of April 2nd. It is awesome to work with someone who supports and motivates you like Fresh does. At my age I could&#8217;ve been arrogant and allowed my ego and social media to get to me; however, I didn&#8217;t and every day is great.&#8221; Mhlongo also made mention of his autobiography, which will be in stores in two weeks. Season 2 of his reality show Living the Dream with Somizi airs on Wednesday on DStv&#8217;s Mzansi Magic. Somizi throwing shade at Bonang and AKA&#8217;s breakup drama?
