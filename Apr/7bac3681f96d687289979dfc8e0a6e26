It took a few weeks of fishing to clear his mind but Russell Domingo has more clarity over his future. And it&#8217;s good news for the Proteas. &#8220;I&#8217;ve loved my four years to date with the side,&#8221; he said on Wednesday. &#8220;It&#8217;s any coach&#8217;s dream to be involved at this level and having the opportunity to try and win the World Cup. If I&#8217;m fortunate enough, I&#8217;d love to have that opportunity again but it&#8217;s not in my control.&#8221; Also read: LISTEN: Keshav Maharaj s stock as Proteas rock star keeps rising Cricket South Africa (CSA) earlier this month confirmed they&#8217;d start the process of calling for applications after next month&#8217;s board meeting and annual awards. The governing body has asked Domingo to re-apply because his current contract, which ends in August, has already been extended three times. Under South African labour law, Domingo would have a legal claim for permanent employment &#8211; something no sporting federation can afford with any coach. As a result, CSA are merely covering their legal bases instead of doubting Domingo&#8217;s ability. Following the Proteas&#8217; successful tour to New Zealand, the 42-year-old sounded reluctant to throw his name into the hat again. But a three-week break seems to have refreshed him. &#8220;I just think my fishing mates like bragging that they have a national coach as a buddy,&#8221; said Domingo jokingly. &#8220;It was actually them that encouraged me to consider re-applying again. Whether I do, we&#8217;ll see.&#8221; South Africa&#8217;s mentor is probably justified in being cautious at the moment because CSA themselves have admitted no details on the application process have been finalised yet. &#8220;I need to find out what the process is first,&#8221; said Domingo. &#8220;It&#8217;s not really that important whether I throw my name into the hat. It&#8217;s the process that needs to take place that&#8217;s more important. &#8220;The people that make the decisions are the most important figures in this process. The powers that be determine what&#8217;s best for South African cricket. I&#8217;m committed. My passion is South African cricket, whether it&#8217;s with the Proteas or an academy side.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
