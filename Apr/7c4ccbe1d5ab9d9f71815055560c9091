Two people have been killed and five others were injured in two separate road accidents in the Worcester area in the Western Cape this weekend, paramedics said on Sunday. ER24 paramedics attended to an accident between the weighbridge and Goudini on Saturday night, ER24 spokeswoman Annine Dormehl said. One person was killed, three others were critically injured, and two more sustained moderate injuries. It is believed that the driver lost control of the vehicle and that the female driver and passengers were ejected from the vehicle as it rolled, she said. In the second incident, at about 7pm, ER24 paramedics attended to a pregnant woman pedestrian in a critical condition after being knocked over by a vehicle on the N1 close to the Ceres turn-off. The woman was transported to Worcester Hospital for immediate care but unfortunately nothing could be done for her and she was declared dead at the hospital. It is believed that the woman was about five months pregnant. The police, Worcester provincial traffic officers, the Breede Valley fire department, and Metro Emergency Services were all on the scene. Local authorities would investigate both incidents, Dormehl said.
