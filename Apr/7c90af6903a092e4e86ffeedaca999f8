Family members reportedly identified the body of the 12-year-old boy whose death in Coligny, North West province, is believed to have been the cause of violent protest action during the past week. News24 reported on Sunday that police said they traced the family who confirmed the boy was their child. On Friday, the two men, who were arrested on Tuesday in connection to the boy&#8217;s death and face a murder charge, appeared in the Coligny Magistrates&#8217; Court and a large police presence was seen outside the court house. It was previously reported by African News Agency that the boy died on April 20 after he allegedly fell or jumped from a bakkie driven by a farmer and the farmer was alleged to have found the boy stealing a sunflower from his field close to Scotland informal settlement. The boy was put into the bakkie, but allegedly jumped or fell out when it slowed down to negotiate a curve. He was injured and died later. At least three houses and three trucks were reported to have been torched and several shops in the small maize producing town were looted in the violent protest action which followed the boy&#8217;s death. Dozens of people were arrested for offences relating to the burning of a police vehicle, looting and possession of suspected stolen goods in Coligny and Blydeville in Lichtenburg.
