A Port Shepstone police reservist was arrested in Margate in connection with an armed robbery last Thursday, reports the South Coast Herald. Another suspect has been arrested while a third is still being sought. According to police spokesperson, Captain Gerald Mfeka, a 31-year-old man, along with two friends, had parked at a service station in Margate. The man&#8217;s friends entered the store and while he was seated in the vehicle, a man opened the door. Three men approached, one of them wearing a beanie bearing an SAPS emblem. The men were armed with firearms and asked him a lot of questions. One of the men opened the car cubbyhole and removed a large sum of cash, said Captain Mfeka. Once the man s friends returned to the vehicle, they were made to drive to Gamalakhe, where they were abandoned. The men opened a case of armed robbery at Margate Police Station and two men, aged 30 and 33, have since been arrested. One of the men served as a police reservist, said Captain Mfeka. Both men appeared in the Ramsgate Magistrate s Court on Monday and the case was postponed for further investigation.
