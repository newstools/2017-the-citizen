The &#8216;Yes&#8217; campaign to give Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan expanded powers was just ahead in a tightly-contested referendum on Sunday but the &#8216;No&#8217; was closing the gap, according to initial results. The &#8216;Yes&#8217; campaign had won 52.7 percent of the vote while the &#8216;No&#8217; campaign had mustered 47.3 percent, the election commission said in figures quoted by state news agency Anadolu, in a count based on more than 90 percent of the ballot boxes.
