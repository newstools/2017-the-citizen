One person was critically injured and three suffered less serious injuries when a Mercedes-Benz sedan and a truck collided on the R24/R560 near Magaliesburg in North West late on Saturday night, paramedics said. Shortly before 10.30pm paramedics from ER24 and other services arrived on the scene where they found the truck on its side and a severely damaged car a few metres away, ER24 spokesman Werner Vermaak said. The driver of the light motor vehicle was trapped and fire fighters had to use hydraulic rescue tools to free him from the wreckage. An emergency medical helicopter was called to the scene to airlift him to a hospital in Johannesburg. Two other occupants of the Mercedes-Benz sustained moderate injuries. They were assessed and treated on the scene and later transported to hospital. The driver of the truck sustained only minor injuries. The cause of the collision was not yet known, Vermaak said.
