The business rights watchdog AfriBusiness indicated that it will approach the Constitutional Court if the Regulation of Agricultural Land Holdings Bill be passed by parliament. The organisation said in its current form, the bill would not pass constitutional muster. Charles Castle, manager at AfriBusiness, said the proposed Bill would not only cause economic havoc in South Africa, but food security would be compromised. It will affect the property rights of all landowners, regardless of race or ethnicity, in terms of the categories of ceilings which the Minister of Rural Development and Land Reform, Gugile Nkwinti, may determine. AfriBusiness says the Bill is so vague and open for interpretation that it leaves the door wide open for grave injustices to be committed. This is especially worrisome in light of the ANC s most recent all-out attack on agricultural landowners (in fact, all property owners) by proposing the implementation of ludicrous land reform policies and Bills. Politicians most recent statements in this regard are so worrisome that it is now clear that there is no dispute on the question of expropriation, he said. AfriBusiness urges the public to submit comments to the minister at ralhbill@drdlr.gov.za or sello.ramasala@drdlr.gov.za, or deliver comments by hand at 184 Jeff Masemola Street, Pretoria. The period for public comment closes on April 16, 2017. The letter with attached commentary is available on www.afribusiness.co.za. AfriBusiness asked people to SMS the word Land to 32277 to assist in the fight against the unlawful expropriation of land. Each SMS costs R1.
