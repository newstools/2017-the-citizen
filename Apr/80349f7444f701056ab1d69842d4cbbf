Kane scored his 20th goal of the Premier League campaign and created one for Son Heung-Min as Spurs romped to a second successive 4-0 win following last weekend&#8217;s stroll against Watford. He has now reached the 20-goal mark in three successive top-flight seasons &#8212; the first Spurs player to do so since Jimmy Greaves between 1966 and 1969. &#8220;It&#8217;s good to be consistent as a striker,&#8221; Kane told BT Sport. &#8220;I want to do that year in, year out. We&#8217;ve still got plenty to do this season, so I don&#8217;t want to think about it.&#8221; Kane scored in the 48th minute, beating Simon Francis with a neat turn before crashing a low shot past Artur Boruc. It was his first goal since he made his return from a four-week lay-off with ankle ligament damage and left him three goals below Everton&#8217;s Romelu Lukaku in the scoring chart. &#8220;It was great to be back out there,&#8221; Kane said. &#8220;I missed being out there. The guys have been winning comfortably and I had to put in a good shift.&#8221; Mousa Dembele, with the opener, and substitute Vincent Janssen, from a stoppage-time corner, were also on target for Tottenham. It was Spurs&#8217; seventh successive league win &#8212; something they last achieved in 1967 &#8212; and left them four points below leaders Chelsea, who visit Manchester United on Sunday. &#8220;Sometimes it&#8217;s good to play first,&#8221; Kane said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got the three points and we can enjoy the Easter weekend.&#8221; Spurs also face Chelsea in the FA Cup semi-finals next weekend.
