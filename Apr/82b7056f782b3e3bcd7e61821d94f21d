Curwin Bosch was only moved to flyhalf again for Saturday&#8217;s meeting with the Rebels because of injuries in the Sharks&#8217; camp. It turns out the 19-year-old now probably has to stay in that position for the foreseeable future because he&#8217;s now become arguably the most important player in South African rugby this year.

It means he&#8217;ll be sidelined for 8 to 10 weeks. More importantly, Pollard won&#8217;t be able to play for the Springboks in June&#8217;s Test series against France. With Pat Lambie still injured, the Lions&#8217; Elton Jantjies is Bosch&#8217;s only real competition for the Bok No 10 jersey. Of course, that&#8217;s assuming national coach Allister Coetzee is convinced of the teenager&#8217;s ability. Nonetheless, Sharks coach Robert du Preez will also probably feel an extended run at flyhalf is a good thing for Bosch. He&#8217;s rotated between fullback and flyhalf to date in the Super Rugby campaign. &#8220;The question of what&#8217;s Curwin&#8217;s best position is a tricky one,&#8221; said Du Preez on Thursday. &#8220;When we initially brought him into the setup, we wanted him at fullback. That position gives him a bit more space. But he&#8217;s grown a lot already and he&#8217;s actually quite relaxed on where he plays.&#8221; That attitude explains why Bosch has found it relatively easy to play flyhalf in such a tough competition. His decision-making has been sound and his goalkicking arguably the best in South Africa this year. &#8220;Curwin&#8217;s attitude is great. When I sat down with him earlier this week, I told him he&#8217;d probably have to go back to fullback because of Garth April&#8217;s injury,&#8221; said Du Preez. &#8220;He was more than willing to despite being at flyhalf for a few games. But we had to keep him at 10 when Inny Radebe injured himself in training this week.&#8221; However, the Sharks mentor admits that it&#8217;s becoming important for Bosch to settle in one position. &#8220;In future, it&#8217;s probably not going to be ideal to keep on switching him between positions,&#8221; said Du Preez. &#8220;But he really does slot into anywhere easily.&#8221; Given the Boks&#8217; demands, that will have to be flyhalf.
