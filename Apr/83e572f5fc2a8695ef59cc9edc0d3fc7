Keep &#8217;em low. It&#8217;s a strange way of describing one of the Sharks&#8217; main objectives for Saturday&#8217;s Super Rugby meeting with the Jaguares at Kings Park. But it&#8217;s also exactly what it amounts to: keep &#8217;em tackles low. Also read: Vulindlu and Mjekevu the lost and found at the Kings High tackles were arguably the main reason why the Sharks lost a thrilling match to the Lions last week. And given how clear the new rules are in this regard, the Durbanites simply have to adapt. &#8220;It&#8217;s really simple. If the players are going to tackle lower, we won&#8217;t have problems with referees penalising us,&#8221; said coach Robert du Preez. &#8220;We have to keep focusing on keeping our tackles low. We know you simply can&#8217;t touch anywhere above the shoulders. It&#8217;s something we talk about every week.&#8221; The tackling issue forms part of a broader theme &#8211; the Sharks are simply too undisciplined in general. They&#8217;ve conceded 43 penalties to date &#8211; the second most in this campaign &#8211; and will continue to experience near-misses in terms of results. &#8220;We played well last week but discipline is a problem,&#8221; said Du Preez. &#8220;We really have to be more vigilant in that regard. We can&#8217;t afford to concede so many penalties.&#8221; That sounds easy enough in theory but the problem for the Sharks is their opponents. As skillful as the Jaguares have become &#8211; they&#8217;re basically Argentina&#8217;s Test side &#8211; they&#8217;re also prickly opponents. Because they sometimes do the illegal on the field to gain an advantage, they frustrate the opposition. Sharks skipper Tera Mtembu is well aware of that. He already had to diffuse some sticky situations in Johannesburg last week. &#8220;There were some tough decisions we had to deal with,&#8221; said the versatile flanker. &#8220;There&#8217;s only so much you can do. It&#8217;s about staying calm and accepting some of the decisions that go against you. You have to live with it. &#8220;The Jaguares aren&#8217;t necessarily more physical than any other side we&#8217;ll play against. But they have extensive international experience. We&#8217;ll simply have to man-up.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
