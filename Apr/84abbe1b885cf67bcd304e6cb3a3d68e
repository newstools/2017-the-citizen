Given the all-round magnificence of their performance against the Cheetahs, it&#8217;s hardly surprising that Robbie Fleck&#8217;s Stormers dominate our team of the week. But we also had a superb encounter between the Lions and Sharks to provide some balance. 15 &#8211; SP Marais (Stormers) How this man is not part of a Springbok training group yet is beyond belief. The journeyman has found his home at Newlands and delivers play of the highest quality weekly. 14 &#8211; Kobus van Wyk (Sharks) You can&#8217;t argue with a wing that&#8217;s scored five tries in the first five rounds. That points to a very good finisher but it&#8217;s Van Wyk&#8217;s running angles and work-rate that&#8217;s really impressive. 13 &#8211; EW Viljoen (Stormers) The good times keep rolling for the 21-year-old, who&#8217;s become a star out of position (believe it or not). Some of his passing against the Cheetahs was out of this world. 12 &#8211; Dan du Plessis (Stormers) Where do the Stormers get all these talented young men? The son of former Province legend Michael not only creates play, he&#8217;s capable of bone-crunching tackles. What more do you need from a man in his position? 11- Courtnall Skosan (Lions) He continues to be the classiest local winger in this year&#8217;s tournament. 10 &#8211; Curwin Bosch (Sharks) The teenager scored another 19 points this week, including a monster 65m penalty. One is starting to wonder if he needs to go back to fullback when Pat Lambie returns&#8230; 9 &#8211; Dewaldt Duvenhage (Stormers) Some observers were sceptical when he came back to Cape Town after a stint in France. But he&#8217;s really proved his worth. 8 &#8211; Warren Whiteley (Lions) He led from the front as always in a difficult game. It was nice to see him remind all of his ability at the lineouts, something that showcases his versatility. 7 &#8211; Sikhumbuzo Notshe (Stormers) He starred at eighthman but a place simply had to be found for him. Notshe is a skillful, mobile attacker &#8211; he scored a hat-trick of tries after all &#8211; and a strong defender. South African rugby needs him to continue this fine form. 6 &#8211; Jaco Kriel (Lions) The level of endurance of this man is astounding. It was his awareness that led to the Lions&#8217; winning try. 5 &#8211; Lood de Jager (Bulls) He&#8217;s still not at the level he was in 2015&#8217;s World Cup but the tall lock is gradually starting to hit his straps. De Jager&#8217;s tackling has been immense to date. 4 &#8211; Eben Etzebeth (Stormers) Class, class, class. Is there a better No 4 lock in world rugby at the moment? 3 &#8211; Coenie Oosthuizen (Sharks) Another busy, powerful all-round performance from one of South African rugby&#8217;s more enigmatic talents. 2 &#8211; Malcolm Marx (Lions) He&#8217;s rapidly becoming the man he idolises &#8211; Bismarck du Plessis. 1 &#8211; JC Janse van Rensburg (Stormers) The former Lions captain doesn&#8217;t strike one as the modern prop. In fact, he&#8217;s kinda old-school. But, boy, he&#8217;s still pretty good. Click here for week five&#8217;s XV. For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
