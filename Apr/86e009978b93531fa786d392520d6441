The director-general for National Treasury Lungisa Fuzile has quit after media speculation he would do so. Director-General Lungisa Fuzile today confirms reports of his imminent departure at National Treasury. Fuzile s contract was due to end in May 2018, however, last week he requested former Minister Pravin Gordhan for a redetermination of his contract with the exit date of 15 May 2017, said National Treasury in a statement on Wednesday. He has been indicating his desire to leave the Treasury for some time. In the past few days, Fuzile has been focusing on ensuring a smooth handover to Minister Malusi Gigaba. Whilst Fuzile has indicated his flexibility to stay on for reasonable amount of time if needed, he and the minister are in discussions on how to ensure that a smooth transition and the institutional strength of National Treasury is sustained and reinforced. Fuzile said his departure and that of his previous principals should not necessarily lead to a change of course as the mandate of National Treasury was reinforced by the Constitution and a number of other pieces of legislation. He said National Treasury officials were competent, highly skilled professionals who were conscious of their higher duty. Their commitment and diligence is not attached to a minister, and they will continue to serve the nation to ensure protection of the fiscus and the sound financial management in South Africa under the current leadership of Minister Malusi Gigaba and Deputy Minister Sfiso Buthelezi. Fuzile leaves National Treasury after 20 years of service. He moved within the ranks from a deputy director after joining in 1998. In May 2017, he will be completing six years in his role as director-general of National Treasury.
