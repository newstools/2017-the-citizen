Isidingo and Muvhango s production companies have confirmed that they received full payments from the SABC despite reports that have stated otherwise. Following reports that the public broadcaster is struggling to pay top local soapies, Word of Mouth Productions and Endemol SA say that the rumour is a fib and they have received full payment as per usual. TshisaLive spoke to the managing director of Endemol SA, the production company that makes Isidingo , and he confirmed that they had received full payments from the SABC with no difficulties whatsoever. Yes, March 2017 payments were honoured. I don t know where all of this stems from because there haven t been any payment problems with SABC, said Endemol SA managing director Helga Palmer. The COO of Word of Mouth productions, Khumbulani Hlongwane, also confirmed they had received full payment. We were paid for March 2017, and all payments for this year have come in with no problems, he said. SABC spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago said the matter was being handled privately between the concerned parties. These commercial transactions happen between the SABC and the production companies, based on the agreement that we have. We are aware of the allegations, but we deal with these productions directly and individually, so we will not engage this matter on the public platforms, he said.
