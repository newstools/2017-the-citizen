One police officer was shot and killed while another was taken to hospital following an attack in Shoshanguve, Pretoria on Friday. Provincial police spokesperson, Brigadier Mathapelo Peters said the provincial police commissioner, Lieutenant General Deliwe de Lange has condemned these senseless attacks . It is reported that the two police officers, stationed at Soshanguve in the north of Pretoria were conducting a stop-and-search [operation] on Ruth First Avenue as part of Operation Paseka (Easter) crime prevention, Peters said. The officers allegedly pulled a suspicious white Toyota Corolla over then an unknown number of suspects opened fire on them, Rekord East reported. The sergeant succumbed to his injuries and was declared dead upon arrival at the clinic. The constable is in a stable condition in hospital. According to Peters, the Toyota was reported stolen in Vosloorus, East Rand. The police have launched a manhunt for the suspects and are appealing to residents that may have information on their identity or whereabouts to inform the police by calling the Crime Stop on 086-001-0111 or visit their nearest police station, he said. It is ironic that the police recently held an Easter prayer service so that the dedicated men and women in blue could be free this Easter weekend and to ensure that residents and visitors in Gauteng enjoy a crime free Easter long weekend, says de Lange. As sad as it is, such hideous acts will not derail the police from fulfilling our constitutional mandate. Instead, we are even more resolute to rid Gauteng of criminal elements. The murder and attempted murder case is being investigated. &#8211; Caxton News Service For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
