Arsenal fans have been calling for Wenger to step down after yet another poor season that sees the team not among the title contenders this season. The Gunners, who are in the risk of not qualifying for the Uefa Champions League, are currently fifth on the log, trailing leaders Chelsea by 18 points. And now opportunistic campaigners have resorted in seizing political marches for their own means in order to voice their discord against Wenger. Arsenal fans will use any protest to push their agenda #WengerOut pic.twitter.com/SQg5euIH44 #mooshLIVE (@mooshLIVE) 7 April 2017 Are you killing two birds with one stone arsenal supporters #ZumaMustFall #AntiZumaMarches #WengerOut pic.twitter.com/4TC2dS95hK Irshaad Seedat (@iSeedat_) 7 April 2017 Spotted at the #ZumaMustFall #AntiZumaMarches @ Mary Fitzgerald Square. #WengerOut pic.twitter.com/yEsMCIQFb4 Thozi Sejanamane (@ThoziTheCreator) 7 April 2017 Arsenal fans mara.. next level Opportunists #MarchforChange #marchagainstzuma #ZumaMustFall #zumamustgo #wengerout pic.twitter.com/QUiVs4fdKa Grate (@theGrateApp) 7 April 2017 No man Arsenal supporters why are you using the #ZumaMustFall marches for Wenger pic.twitter.com/N62zP4pWEI Althea (@otp_love) 7 April 2017 Arsenal fans know what&#8217;s up #ZumaMustFall #wengerout pic.twitter.com/CkiriWqcsp KriesLFC (@KriesLFC) 7 April 2017 @vngalwana @moloko_ta ARSENAL supporters have a different agenda #ZumaMustFall but Wenger 1st pic.twitter.com/Zwn2eirB12 Thulani Luvalo (@houzmates) 7 April 2017
