Protest action aimed at putting pressure on Jacob Zuma to step down as president is mounting after thousands of South Africans took to the streets on Friday in anti-Zuma marches and pickets. Opposition parties are reportedly organising a National Day of Action in which they will march from Church Square in Pretoria at noon on Wednesday to the Union Buildings in a bid for President Jacob Zuma to be removed from office.

The parties reportedly pointed to Zuma&#8217;s Cabinet reshuffle of finance ministers over the past three years, saying that it had resulted in international ratings agencies downgrading the country. They criticised how the reshuffle &#8220;protected and rewarded incompetent ministers&#8221;, pointing to Faith Muthambi and Bathabile Dlamini specifically. They further reminded that the Constitutional Court had found Zuma had acted illegally unlawfully and failed to uphold defend and respect the Constitution in that he disregarded the Public Protector s remedial action on the Nkandla corruption , as quoted from the TimesLive report. Wednesday&#8217;s march will follow the day of national protest action on Friday. See some of the tweets from the day here: This was Mary Fitzgerald Square!
