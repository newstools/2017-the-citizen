Commuters making use of the Golden Arrow and MyCiTi bus services can expect to be left stranded on Wednesday morning if they don t make use of alternative means of transport. Both Golden Arrow and the City of Cape Town have confirmed their bus services would be suspended due to the nationwide strike by bus drivers. Golden Arrow spokesperson Bronwen Dyke advised commuters to make use of alternative transport, adding their would be no refunds but those who had purchased tickets before Tuesday would be able to use it at a later date. Golden Arrow has warned its bus commuters to use alternative means of transport as its service would be suspended indefinitely from Wednesday. In a media statement, the City of Cape Town said it was informed by its vehicle operating companies that a lockout would be instituted from midnight on Tuesday to ensure the safety of commuters and personnel for the duration of the strike. This in effect means that there will be no MyCiTi trunk or feeder services available as from Wednesday morning, for as long as the strike and lockout continue. The city said nearly 71,000 people make use of the MyCiTi service. These commuters would now have to use either trains, minibus taxis or private vehicles, meaning roads and trains were expected to be congested on Wednesday. The strike follows talks between unions and bus companies deadlocking at the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA). Unions are seeking a 12% increase while employers are offering 7.5%. African News Agency For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
