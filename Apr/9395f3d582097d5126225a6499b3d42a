A man was caught in the act after he overpowered an elderly couple and attempted to rob them of their belongings at a farm outside Tzaneen, Limpopo police said on Friday. It is alleged that the suspect attacked an elderly couple aged 65 and 68 years old who were with their 9 year-old grand child at Charles Luther Farm in the Lekgalameetse area outside Tzaneen, said spokesman Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe. During that process, the old man and the child managed to escape and called the police who reacted swiftly jointly with the local farming community and arrested the suspect. The family was unharmed. The 32-year-old man would appear in the Lenyenye Magistrate Court on Tuesday on charges of house-breaking, assault and possession of an unlicensed firearm.
