Though she admits a third straight Old Mutual Two Oceans victory is a tempting prospect, Caroline Wostmann says she is willing to sacrifice a historic treble this weekend, as she goes in search of the Comrades Marathon crown in June. After starting conservatively at the 56km Two Oceans ultra-marathon in Cape Town in 2015 and 2016, Wostmann chased down the early leaders to win on both occasions.

After discussing both goals with her coach, Lindsey Parry, she insisted she would not be lured into a fast early pace this weekend, in order to reserve herself for the gruelling Comrades contest. &#8220;I&#8217;ve thought about it a lot,&#8221; Wostmann said. &#8220;I spoke to Lindsey about it, and he told me I have to decide what I want because I&#8217;ll have to push hard to be competitive on Saturday, and it&#8217;s so close to Comrades. &#8220;I decided Comrades was more important to me.&#8221; With Wostmann taking a cautious approach, and last year&#8217;s Comrades &#8216;down&#8217; run winner Charne Bosman giving the race a miss, local favourites for the Two Oceans title will include ultra-marathon debutant Jenna Challenor and veteran Olympian Tanith Maxwell. The foreign contingent is expected to dominate the men&#8217;s race, led by defending champion Mike Fokoroni of Zimbabwe. For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
