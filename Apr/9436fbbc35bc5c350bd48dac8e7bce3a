One person died and two were critically injured when two cars collided near the Kliprivier and Swartkoppies roads intersection in Alberton late on Friday night, Gauteng paramedics said. Shortly before 11pm, paramedics from ER24 arrived on the scene and found that bystanders had pulled the driver out of one of the cars, ER24 spokesman Werner Vermaak said. He was in a critical condition. He was treated on the scene and later rushed to Mulbarton Hospital for further care. A woman was also found with various injuries. She was still trapped in the vehicle and had to be extricated. Once freed, she was rushed to Union Hospital. A 19-year-old woman was also found with critical injuries. While paramedics were attending to her, her condition deteriorated and she showed no signs of life. Paramedics attempted to revive her for some time. Sadly, she succumbed to her injuries on [the] scene and was later declared dead, Vermaak said. African News Agency (ANA) For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
