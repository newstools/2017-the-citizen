We have Oskido to thank for ending the conflict between Robert Marawa and Fikile Mbalula. Oskido had a sit down with both Marawa and Mbalula and compelled them to sort out their differences. &#8220;They are both my best friends, and I decided to call them for a meeting, and they agreed so everything went well. So Fikile and Marawa [Robert] are buddies, no more fighting,&#8221; Oskido told TshisaLIVE. &#8220;Conflicts and fights are a result of a failure to sit down and talk. This often leads to undesirable drama. It&#8217;s good to see two people I hold highly, @robert_marawa and Minister of Police, hug and make up after talking,&#8221; the DJ wrote on Instagram.
