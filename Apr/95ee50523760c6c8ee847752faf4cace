Don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s just South African cricket that complains over the exodus of local players to the United Kingdom. Certain sections of the English cricketing family aren&#8217;t happy either. Former Proteas quick Marchant de Lange has become the latest target accused by critics of robbing English players of playing opportunities. Also read: Wayne Parnell still represents the future of the Proteas The 26-year-old, who played two Tests for South Africa, recently joined county side Glamorgan. He didn&#8217;t qualify for a so-called Kolpak contract but managed to wangle a gig as an overseas player because his wife has a British passport. Steve Rhodes, a former England wicketkeeper and current coach of Worcestershire, is one prominent local voice who&#8217;s not impressed with De Lange&#8217;s recruitment. &#8220;I think some of Glamorgan&#8217;s inclusions, moving away from the boys from the valleys, is disappointing,&#8221; he told Wales Online. &#8220;Their attack could be an Australian in Michael Hogan, a South African in Marchant de Lange and Craig Meschede who was born in South Africa and raised here. Timm van der Gugten is playing on a Dutch passport. &#8220;I don t think that s necessarily a good thing for English cricket.&#8221; It doesn&#8217;t actually stop there. Glamorgan also boast former Proteas batters in Jacques Rudolph and Colin Ingram, who potentially keep out promising local batsmen. It&#8217;s a problem in general because &#8211; with perhaps the exception of Sussex&#8217;s Stiaan van Zyl &#8211; the South African players don&#8217;t necessarily go to England to improve for future Proteas selection again. Rhodes subtly accused Glamorgan, who play Worcestershire from Thursday onwards, of buying foreign players to &#8220;improve results in the short-term&#8221; instead of focusing on the future. &#8220;I d never say we are not going to recruit foreign players at Worcester,&#8221; he said. &#8220;All of a sudden you may get a cracker-jack player who is worth the effort and money to bring to Worcester. That could be a real bonus to Worcestershire and county cricket. &#8220;But surely it s about producing English-qualified players that England can pick. Sadly a lot of these (foreign) guys are going to be taking up major positions in local teams.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
