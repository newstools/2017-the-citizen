Five people were injured when the roof of Charlotte Maxeke hospital collapsed at the beginning of last month. Gauteng Infrastructure Development MEC Jacob Mamabolo appointed a private firm, Adams and Adams to investigate the incident which left the front entrance of the hospital in shambles. According to EWN, Mamabolo said the findings were still confidential at this stage. I will now be circulating the report to government to the premier, MEC Gwen Ramokgopa and Minister Aaron Motsaoledi. Several patients had to be evacuated while others scrambled in the dark to safety. Sections of the hospital was plunged into darkness because the collapse caused the electricity to cut out. The DA s shadow MEC for Health in Gauteng, Jack Bloom, meanwhile has called for an independent investigation, saying a structural engineering assessment must urgently be done into other areas of the hospital which might be in danger of collapse. There was a report in 2012 that had warned about structural problems in the building. And staff have complained for years about roofs that leak water and sewage, Bloom said.
