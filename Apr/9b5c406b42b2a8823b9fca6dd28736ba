Makhura urged residents to take action against leaders who have failed them instead of sitting back and complaining . This country has come very far. We must do everything in our power to defend and consolidate our freedom. We must advance our democracy. When your leaders, from local to national government, are not leading properly, take action because freedom is in your hands, he said. Unfortunately, our country is captured by a few people who benefit from it.
