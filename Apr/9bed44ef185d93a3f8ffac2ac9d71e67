Johan Ackermann&#8217;s burning desire to improve himself and become an international coach is the main reason why he&#8217;s leaving the Lions. The widely expected news that the 46-year-old mentor has joined English club Gloucester was confirmed on Monday morning. He has signed a three-year contract. One positive development to emerge though is that he&#8217;ll only be leaving at the end of the current Super Rugby campaign. Also read: Lions nervous over Ackermann as overseas compliments roll in &#8220;I want to get all the emotion out the way so we can focus on the current campaign,&#8221; said Ackermann. &#8220;This is not about me. My focus is the players.&#8221; Ackermann&#8217;s departure asks renewed questions over South African rugby&#8217;s ability to keep its leading coaches. Following last year&#8217;s shocking Springbok year under Allister Coetzee, there were calls from some quarters that the South African Rugby Union (Saru) should&#8217;ve found a spot for the Lions coach. That didn&#8217;t happen. But Ackermann reiterated that he&#8217;s not moving abroad because Saru weren&#8217;t proactive in trying to keep him. &#8220;Obviously there are contracts in place at the Springboks,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I must look at opportunities where I can enhance myself and at this stage I respect the fact that there is a man in the national coaching job. I&#8217;m going to improve myself as a coach and I believe if that&#8217;s the end goal, a door will open for me.&#8221; &#8220;SA Rugby has the right to choose who they want as coach. Every coach wants to coach an international side. Hopefully this is a stepping stone for me.&#8221; Given that Ackermann is still available for the rest of the Super Rugby campaign, the Lions aren&#8217;t in a rush to identify a replacement. Swys de Bruin, the union&#8217;s experienced assistant coach, will not be joining Ackermann in Gloucester and would be an obvious candidate to take over. &#8220;The team is in a good place right now. Theres no need to name a replacement immediately,&#8221; said Rudolf Straeuli, the Lions&#8217; chief executive. For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
