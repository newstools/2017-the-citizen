Sprinting sensation Wayde van Niekerk duly received a National Order on Friday in another entry to his glittering CV. The 24-year-old, who romped to Olympic gold last year in Rio, was bestowed the Order of Ikhamanga in Gold.

Another sporting recipient was rower Matthew Brittain for his gold medal at 2012&#8217;s London Olympics. &#8220;His strong determination is an inspiration to the young people of South Africa,&#8221; said the Presidency. &#8220;Brittain s career has been adversely affected by recurring back injuries. In 2010 he had a back surgery, but recovered remarkably to go on and win in the 2012 Olympics in London. However, his back problem recurred in 2013, forcing him to eventually take the decision to retire. He is now fulfilling this passion through his events company focusing on sponsorship for the rowing team and raising the profile of the sport in the country.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
