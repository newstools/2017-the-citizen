Following the axing of former finance minister Pravin Gordhan and his deputy, Mcebisi Jonas, from National Treasury, the ministry s director-general, Lungisa Fuzile, has reportedly asked to leave his post at the end of this month. Bloomberg reported on Tuesday that ,according to three people with knowledge of the matter, Fuzile wants to resign a year before his contract runs out after being at the helm of Treasury for six years. Fuzile informed former finance minister Pravin Gordhan of his plans to leave a day before Gordhan was fired on March 31, according to the people who asked not to be identified because no announcement has been made yet, the report stated. During a press conference earlier on Tuesday in Pretoria with newly appointed Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba and his deputy, Sfiso Buthelezi, Fuzile said his objective was to ensure that the handover to the ministers was orderly and not harmful to the stability of Treasury. He said he would do everything to make sure that happens , but his resignation could spark fears of a mass exodus of skilled people in the department. Cabinet last year extended Fuzile s original five-year term for 24 months.
