Electronics giant Samsung will this week offer an unusually early software update for its newly-released Galaxy S8 phone, it said Monday after some consumers complained of red-tinted screens. The launch of the device is a key step for the South Korean tech firm as it seeks to move on from last year&#8217;s humiliating withdrawal of the Galaxy Note 7 over exploding batteries, which hammered the firm&#8217;s once-stellar reputation. The Galaxy S8 started over-the-counter sales in the US and its home market but South Korean users who pre-ordered the phones complained their screens displayed an unusually reddish hue. Online images of their phones went viral on social media but Samsung denied a hardware flaw and maintained that users could manually adjust the colour range according to their preferences. As more users voiced doubts, Samsung said Monday that a software update would fix the problem by allowing them to readjust colours over a wider range than at present. &#8220;Samsung&#8230; has decided to release a software update starting from this week which will provide consumers with a further enhanced ability to adjust the colour setting to their preference,&#8221; it said in a statement. Samsung &#8212; the world&#8217;s largest maker of smartphones &#8212; has pinned its hopes on the Galaxy S8 to compete against archrival Apple&#8217;s iPhone after last year&#8217;s Note 7 disaster. The recall debacle cost Samsung billions of dollars in lost profits and hammered its global credibility, forcing it to apologise to consumers and postpone the S8 launch.
