Popular South African house DJ Zinhle Jiyane has had her fair share of romance drama with ex-boyfriend AKA in the past two years, and her relationship with new boyfriend Brendon Naidoo is no different. Jiyane s boyfriend has been trending on social media following rumours of him being a fraudster and after numerous people accused him of stealing their money . Naidoo was taken away by the police on Saturday afternoon on charges of fraud. Police spokesperson Lieutenant Kay Makhubela told Sunday Times that Brandon was still under police custody. &#8220;I can confirm that he appeared in court on Monday and has been remanded in custody. He will remain in custody until next week,&#8221; he said. Naidoo is currently in prison and is being kept in prison until his next court appearance, which is next week Tuesday, April 18, when they would have gathered enough evidence by then. Drum Magazine sat down with Naidoo s mother Ramela Reddy, who said she did not know what would happen to her son and preferred that the family lawyer speak on their behalf. &#8220;We have just come to see Brendon, and once we get the all evidence, we will be able to give an update. For now, we cannot give too much,&#8221; said Brendon s lawyer, Mr Abaner. The magazine article also reported that DJ Zinhle tried visiting her boyfriend in jail on Saturday night, but was not allowed to see him due to strict visiting hours.
