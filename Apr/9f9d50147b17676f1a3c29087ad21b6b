Road cyclist Ashleigh Moolman-Pasio continued to build on her superb form on Sunday, earning her third top-10 finish at a World Tour race in the space of eight days. The 31-year-old Cervelo-Bigla Pro Cycling rider finished sixth at the Liege-Bastogne-Liege, 31 seconds off the pace of Dutch winner Anna van der Breggen (Boels-Dolmans), after finishing sixth and ninth respectively at La Fleche Wallonne Feminine, also held in Belgium, and the Amstel Gold Race in the Netherlands. &#8220;Overall I am happy with how things are progressing. It&#8217;s getting better every race,&#8221; said Moolman-Pasio, who closed out her European spring campaign in style after recovering from a fractured hip late last year. &#8220;It&#8217;s amazing to ride with this (Cervelo-Bigla) team. The level of commitment to each other and to the team goal is so inspiring. &#8220;We started Amstel Gold with bad luck and not being in a great position and every race since then we have taken a step up.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
