ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe has poured water over reports that he, treasurer-general Zweli Mkhize and Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa had to apologise to Zuma for voicing their discontent with the Cabinet reshuffle. The trio broke ranks with ANC tradition and publicly criticised Zuma last week. Ramaphosa called the axing of former finance minister Gordhan &#8216;unacceptable&#8217;, while Mantashe said the restructuring of the Cabinet had been forced upon them and Mkhize said the ANC was no longer on top of Zuma&#8217;s priorities. At a press briefing, Mantashe said the three leaders were not expected to apologise for their remarks. He admitted, though, that it could have been handled better. &#8220;The length of the meeting collapses rapidly the rumour that we were put in this meeting, and President Zuma just lectured us, and we all cowered down and apologised &#8221; Mantashe said. &#8220;The officials acknowledged that their public dissonance on the matter was a mistake that should not be committed again,&#8221; he said.
