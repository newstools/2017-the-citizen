The City of Cape Town announced on Friday its MyCiTi bus service would start operating again on Saturday morning following the majority of unions representing bus drivers signing an agreement with employers following a crippling two day strike. Passengers should please note that it may take a few hours for the service to settle in, meaning there may be some initial delays on some of the routes. We expect that the service will normalise and that most buses will adhere to the weekend time schedule as the day continues, said Brett Herron, the city s mayoral committee member for transport and urban development. I want to thank commuters for their patience during the strike and ask them to please bear with us as we get the service up to full speed again tomorrow [Saturday]. Buses ceased operating on Wednesday when drivers from five unions went on strike following a deadlock in wage negotiations. Labour minister Mildred Oliphant on Friday announced the strike was over as the SA Transport Allied Workers Union (Satawu), Transport and Allied Workers Union of SA (Tawusa) and Transport and Allied Workers Union (Tawu) accepted the nine percent wage deal, signing an agreement binding all unions. The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) and the Transport and Services Workers Union (Taswu) rejected the offer, with Numsa defiantly announcing the strike would continue.
