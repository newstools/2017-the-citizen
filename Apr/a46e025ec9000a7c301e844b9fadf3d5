TV veteran Joe Mafela&#8217;s tombstone was temporarily removed a few days after his funeral because the soil needed to settle first. The erection of the six-ton tombstone set tongues wagging, as it was estimated to cost between R100 000 and R300 000. &#8220;Yes, the tombstone was put back yesterday, and the Mafela family are happy to have it re-erected,&#8221; said Lebohang Khitsane, who designed and created the tombstone. &#8220;It&#8217;s a heavy stone 6 tons. The worst thing that could happen is that the stone sinks into the concrete. So we have it removed so it can all settle,&#8221; Khitsane told TimesLIVE about the removal of the tombstone. Mafela&#8217;s family had specifically requested that Mafela&#8217;s final resting place be an accurate depiction of who he was a man who had spent decades entertaining millions of people through the silver screen. The family was extremely happy with the design, and our team worked hard to make it in just three days, Khitsane said.
