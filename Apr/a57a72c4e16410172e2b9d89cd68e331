Sushi king and businessman Kenny Kunene on Tuesday criticised ANC veterans for calling for President Jacob Zuma&#8217;s sacking. More than 100 veterans and stalwarts, who included Sheryl Carolus, Gertrude Shope, Frank Chikane, Siphiwe Nyanda, Ben Turok and Andrew Mlangeni, held a meeting in Johannesburg and, later, a press conference in which they accused the president of having crossed a new line following last week&#8217;s Cabinet reshuffle. I just think that veterans should let young ppl decide who should lead them&#8230;and they must joy enjoy their pension n retirement&#8230; &mdash; Kenny Kunene (@Kenny_T_Kunene) April 4, 2017 However, Kunene thinks the veterans had no business discussing ANC matters, saying they must just enjoy their pension and retirement and let young people decided who should lead them. &#8220;I don&#8217;t understand archbishops n pastors who cannot forgive n pray for people but continue to condemn them. Worse sitting next to politicians,&#8221; he said, referring to Chikane and the church leaders who had recently called for the president to step down.

Worse sitting next to politicians &mdash; Kenny Kunene (@Kenny_T_Kunene) April 4, 2017 However, Kenny was never ready for the reactions he received from his followers. These were some of the comments he received: &#8220;You are trying too hard &#8230;&#8230;sense dololo.&#8221; &#8220;Jack of all trades, master of none from being a thief, to Sushi king, now an ANN7 political analyst Emanyana Tuu.&#8221; &#8220;You&#8217;ve got it all wrong Kenny, veterans never spend years in jail and in the struggle to come back and look at Zuma destroying the ANC.&#8221; &#8220;Again missing the point, ANC is out of control, they providing some advice what&#8217;s wrong with that?&#8221; Another said the veterans had every right to be commenting on ANC matters as they spent &#8220;most&#8221;of their lives in prison or in exile fighting for a democratic government. &#8220;Unlike you who was in prison for robbery,&#8221; they said. Kunene was actually imprisoned for Ponzi scheme fraud. Another called Kunene a &#8220;hypocrite&#8221; for having, in 2013, written an open letter criticising the president but now talks like his praise singer. In the letter Kunene had told the president he was disappointed with the ANC. He said he was once Zuma&#8217;s &#8220;fervent&#8221; supporter and donated to his cause, believing &#8220;you would be the force for change the youth and the poor desperately need in our country&#8221;. He had further criticised Zuma for, among others, his friendship with the Guptas and the money spent on Nkandla, saying they should have been the last straw for South Africans. &#8220;I love the ANC, or what it&#8217;s supposed to be, but I don&#8217;t love your ANC,&#8221; he said in a letter published by IOL. Things have evidently changed now as Kunene criticises any movement against the president. Also read: Fire Zuma, stalwarts tell ANC
