In case you missed it, former SABC COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng, the most confident man South Africa, held a press conference on Wednesday and spoke about, among other things, his amazing self, the chaos at the SABC and politics. After his exciting speech, legendary Kwaito musician Doc Shebeleza had a few words of his own to share. He praised the former COO for the 90% local music quota &#8211; one of the things Hlaudi did right &#8211; further calling for artists to show their appreciation. He said if someone made the right decisions for you, it was only right to thank them. &#8220;You have the radio presenters, Robert Marawa, Bonang Matheba, they are not here to say thank you. Why? The ones who are benefiting are not here,&#8221; he was quoted as saying. Though Bonang has not yet responded to the call, Marawa said Doc Shebeleza should come to the Metro FM studios and tell him that &#8220;nonsense&#8221; to his face. @Allan_Tshuma @bonang_m Tell that Doc Shebeleza to come to MetroFM Studios at 6pm and tell me that nonsense to my face!! &mdash; robertmarawa (@robertmarawa) April 19, 2017 Now Doc Shebeleza&#8217;s comments have left us confused. All this time we thought Police Minister Fikile Mbalula was the one who saved Marawa from being fired. Read more: You tried to get me fired, Marawa tells Mbalula
