Andre Esterhuizen and the Sharks both felt the sharp pain of him being suspended for six weeks on Monday. The 23-year-old centre was handed the sentence following his red card for a tip tackle against the Rebels at the weekend. Referees have been told to merciless when it comes to dangerous tackling. It certainly didn&#8217;t help that Esterhuizen crashed Sefanaia Naivalu&#8217;s head into the ground first. &#8220;His ban is a massive disappointment for us and a big loss,&#8221; said Sharks coach Robert du Preez on Monday before the team&#8217;s departure for Argentina to play the Jaguares. &#8220;These things happen in rugby. Andre is really remorseful of what happened. To be honest, it can happen to any player. But we&#8217;ve got to look forward now.&#8221; Nonetheless, it&#8217;s still a hammer blow to Esterhuizen, who&#8217;s arguably been the best local inside centre in this year&#8217;s campaign. The former Junior Springbok has always been an excellent defender but in 2017 he&#8217;s really become an attacking force too, particularly with his ability to break tackles. &#8220;Andre&#8217;s been playing such good rugby,&#8221; said Du Preez. &#8220;I believe he would&#8217;ve been a certainty to make the South Africa &#8216;A&#8217; side but he probably could&#8217;ve even been in the Springbok squad. His defence and his organisational abilities are so valuable to us.&#8221; But it&#8217;s not all doom and gloom. Esterhuizen&#8217;s place will be taken by Johan Deysel, a talented Namibian international. The 25-year-old is well known to Du Preez, who coached him at NWU-Pukke and the Leopards in Potchefstroom. He&#8217;s perhaps more known for his fine attacking play &#8211; he had the honour of scoring a try against the All Blacks in the 2015 World Cup. And don&#8217;t forget a stupendous individual try during the Varsity Cup in 2015. &#8220;The door has now been opened for Johan. He&#8217;s been in our setup all along and it&#8217;s great to give a guy like him an opportunity. His defence is also sound,&#8221; said Du Preez.
