President Jacob Zuma on Tuesday, hosted the Emir of the State of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al-Thani, who is in South Africa on a two day state visit. The State visit aims to deepen and strengthen the already existing good political, economic and social relations. The visit by the Emir will further review progress in South Africa-Qatar bilateral political and economic relations and identify three short-term projects in the fields of trade and investment, agriculture and oceans economy, the Presidency said in a statement. The Presidency said that the visit is anticipated to provide the two heads of State with a platform to discuss matters of strategic interest related to regional and global security. The total trade between South Africa and Qatar has increased from R4 billion in 2012 to R7 billion in 2016. One of South Africa s largest investments in the Middle East is Sasol s joint venture gas-to-liquid (GTL) facility located in Qatar. Other South African investments in Qatar include PetroWorld, PetroSA, and CKR Consulting Engineers. The Presidency said the visit followed Zuma s visit to Qatar in May 2016. Zuma s visit last year, focused on cooperation in trade and investment, agriculture and agro-processing, defence, the ocean economy, as well as tourism. It also led to the proposed elevation of structured bilateral engagement to Ministerial level and agreements to establish a Joint Technical Committee and pursue the establishment of a joint SA-Qatar Investment Fund in cooperation with Qatar s Sovereign Wealth Fund.
