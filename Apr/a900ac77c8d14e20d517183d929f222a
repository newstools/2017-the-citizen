Sipho Ndlovu, popularly known as Brickz MaBrigado, has reconnected with DJ Cleo after 10 years of beef and are back in the studio again. The two went their separate ways 10 years ago after Brickz reportedly said DJ Cleo was gay, but that all seems to be in the past now. DJ Cleo told Phat Joe, in an interview on Real Goboza, that drugs made Brickz feel &#8220;untouchable&#8221;, further urging young people not to do drugs. &#8220;We&#8217;ve never really come out about it, but obviously I was protective of him, but now it&#8217;s just the perfect moment to say it strained a perfect relationship. And now that he&#8217;s clean two years clean we&#8217;re back to making music and making people dance.&#8221; Though DJ Cleo does not drink or smoke, Brickz said it was not about doing what others were doing. &#8220;We&#8217;ve had conversations about a lot things, and I said: &#8216;you know, I don&#8217;t want to have regrets, I&#8217;ve learned a lot about everything that has been happening in my life&#8217;.&#8221; &#8220;So basically what he&#8217;s trying to say is: &#8216;I don&#8217;t do all the other stuff, but I drink&#8217;,&#8221; interjected Cleo. Brickz told Phat Joe that when he got in to the music industry, he was still mourning and did not know where to get comfort. Drugs seemed like the only option at the time, with money rolling in. &#8220;I would like to think it was, when I got into the industry I was still mourning, I lost my mom. I lost my gran. My gran was like my father, like my dad. So I lost two of the most important people in my life, and when the money started rolling in, you never know what to do with it, really. Because the people you&#8217;ve dreamed of buying houses for are nowhere to be found. However, R2 million later, MaBrigado is back in the music scene with their new single, &#8216;Amafluit&#8217;, already out. They two will perform it on Friday on Club 808 for the first time.
