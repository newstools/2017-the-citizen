It&#8217;s not exactly a full-blown demotion but Tera Mtembu won&#8217;t be captaining the Sharks against the Jaguares on Saturday. Coach Robert du Preez on Thursday named a side sporting seven changes for the trip to Buenos Aires, with the 26-year-old flanker sitting on the bench. There&#8217;s a certain amount of intrigue over that move.

But last week&#8217;s dire 9-all draw against the Rebels perhaps exposed the Sharks&#8217; inexperienced leadership core. Du Preez backed every on-field decision Mtembu made afterwards yet perhaps felt against the prickly Argentinians, the team needs a more grizzled leader. As a result, the veteran Philip van der Walt will lead the side this weekend. That said, Mtembu&#8217;s workload has been heavy to date as well. Though a late decision was made to rather rest him, Springbok prop Beast Mtawarira gave a glimpse as to what a pressurised atmosphere the Durbanites will experience. &#8220;The Jaguares lift their game at home and feed off the crowd,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a different atmosphere. There&#8217;s a lot of noise and loud music that plays. It is a vibe that can throw you off your game but you also need to feed off it. You don&#8217;t get the opportunity much to do so.&#8221; Discipline is very much in focus at the moment when it comes to the Sharks. They&#8217;ve lost influential centre Andre Esterhuizen for six weeks following a tip tackle and face the most undisciplined team in this year&#8217;s tournament. The Jaguares also have no problem dragging opponents down to their level. To emerge from this trip unscathed, the Sharks &#8211; for one thing &#8211; will need to keep the tackles low. Yet that&#8217;s easier said than done. &#8220;Every season there are law changes,&#8221; said Mtawarira. &#8220;You simply have to adapt. It&#8217;s your responsibility to train within those new laws. There are going to be marginal calls and of course you inhibit yourself a bit because you&#8217;re wary of a card. But it&#8217;s something you can&#8217;t change.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
