Rapper Riky Rick proves that you cannot keep a good man down. Merely a month after leaving record label Mabala Noise and accusing them of taking back their possessions, Riky has bought himself a flashy new car worth million, putting rumors of bankruptcy to shame. Rick hasn t said anything about his new ride, understandably so, after his ordeal with his former record label, Mabala Noise. However, fellow rapper and friend, Cassper Nyovest was not shy to spill the beans. Nyovest who has never been shy of flaunting his fancy cars on social media told reporters that he was the one who convinced Riky to purchase the expensive ride after receiving a huge pay cheque, which we assume was from his recent partnership with Vaseline. According to Johannesburg Ferrari dealer, Mr Kotini s new toy costs anything between R4 million to R7 million. So there you have it, Riky may have left his record label, but he is obviously still cashing it.
