All seems right in Luvo Manyonga&#8217;s world. The freakishly talented athlete made headlines last year when he claimed silver in the long jump at the Rio Olympics and began 2017 with a leap of 8.62m, the South African record. But the 26-year-old&#8217;s recent success doesn&#8217;t everything is now hunky dory in his personal life.

The man from Mbekweni in Paarl was addicted to tik &#8211; crystal meth in South African terms &#8211; and was banned for 18 months in 2012 when he tested positive during a routine test. &#8220;I have been battling substance abuse since I was a teenager and it has been a difficult journey,&#8221; Manyonga said in a statement. &#8220;I want to show others there is no shame in your past and to empower others to shake off the stigma associated with addiction.&#8221; Manyonga didn&#8217;t travel to Rio without help. He was actually enrolled in rehabilitation programme in the build-up to the showpiece and is currently still busy participating in the relevant treatment facility&#8217;s aftercare. &#8220;Decisions such as the one I have taken to be a part of a rehabilitation movement hopefully can allow others to admit to the daily challenges,&#8221; said Manyonga. &#8220;I am committed to staying drug free and I want to achieve great things in my career and life. To achieve my goals and dreams I understand that I will need all the support I can get.&#8221; It&#8217;s understood Manyonga was tested immediately after his record jump in Pretoria, delivering a negative result.
