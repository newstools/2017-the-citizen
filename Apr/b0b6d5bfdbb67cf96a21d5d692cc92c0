The SA National Civic Organisation (Sanco) has said a robbery at 9 Infantry Batallion base in Khayelitsha in the early hours of Good Friday that saw the suspects get away with assault rifles undermined national security and compromised the safety of local communities. Gunmen made off with several rifles after overpowering two guards on duty at the base, forcing them into the armoury to open the firearms safe, before making off with the guns. We are extremely concerned about the ease with which high-calibre weapons and ammunition are robbed from national key points which are supposed to be highly securitised environments, said Sanco spokesman Jabu Mahlangu. We cannot imagine these weapons a day longer in the hands of mindless and heartless gangsters who have the potential to unleash terror on our communities. Sanco called for the speedy arrest of those behind the robbery. Criminals are the ones that should be disarmed and not be armed from state armouries. African News Agency (ANA)
