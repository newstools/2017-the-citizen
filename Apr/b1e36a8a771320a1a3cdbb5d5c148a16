The woman accused of siphoning off about R24 million from MTN will plead not guilty, her attorney, Piet du Plessis, said on Wednesday. Ruth Moshabane, an accountant at the multinational cellular phone company, was alleged to have committed the crimes of fraud and theft between July 16, 2105 and April 4 this year. The bank contacted MTN management about suspicious transactions made into one of their employees personal bank accounts. Moshabane appeared in the Johannesburg Specialised Commercial Crimes Court yesterday to apply for bail. However, due to a full roll, prosecutor Bongani Chauke asked for the matter to be rolled over to tomorrow, which regional magistrate Jerry van Vuuren granted. The Hawks Serious Commercial Crimes Unit in Johannesburg arrested the 42-year-old woman last week at MTN headquarters in Fairlands. She made a brief appearance in court last Thursday. Moshabane has been working for MTN for more than 13 years. Additional reporting by ANA For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
