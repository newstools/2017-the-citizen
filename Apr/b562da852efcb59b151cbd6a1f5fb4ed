Two people died in two separate road accidents, one an apparent hit-and-run, in Kempton Park in Ekurhuleni on Saturday morning, paramedics said. A pedestrian was killed when he was hit by a vehicle on the Pretoria Road near Elgin Road in Kempton Park, ER24 spokesman Werner Vermaak said. At about 7am, paramedics from ER24 arrived on the scene where they found the lifeless body of the man in the road. Sadly, there was nothing that they could do for him and he was declared dead. Bystanders explained that the vehicle responsible for the collision fled the scene prior to paramedics arrival. The incident was handed over to the local authorities for investigation, he said. In a second accident about 15 minutes later, paramedics from ER24 arrived on the corner of CR Swart and Green streets where they found two vehicles had collided. One of the vehicles overturned during the collision and ejected its driver. Upon assessment, paramedics found that the driver was trapped underneath the overturned vehicle. There was nothing that paramedics could do for him and he was declared dead on the scene. Three other people were found with minor injuries near the second vehicle. They were assessed by paramedics and later transported to Arwyp Hospital for further care, Vermaak said. African News Agency (ANA) For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
