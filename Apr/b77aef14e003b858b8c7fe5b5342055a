By now, the world is aware of Gift Ngoepe, South Africa and the continent&#8217;s first Baseball superstar. On Saturday morning (SA time) though, the 27-year-old infielder of the Pittsburgh Pirates showed that he has the potential to truly contribute substantially. Ngoepe played a starring role in the Pirates&#8217; 12-2 victory over the Miami Marlins, notably hitting a triple in the sixth inning. It was a beauty, almost sailing over for a home run and allowing him to run all the way to third base. Less spectacularly but nonetheless impressive, the man from Polokwane also managed two walks.
