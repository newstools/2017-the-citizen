A video of a man, presumed to be a taxi driver, assaulting a woman in Johannesburg CBD on Friday has emerged. In the video, a man can be seen slapping a woman and trying to force her in to his taxi as she tries to run away, but to no avail. The man finally manages to force her in to the taxi and shuts the door. An eyewitness who took the video said she called the police, and the man was arrested, though the Jeppe and Johannesburg Central police stations could not confirm the arrest.
