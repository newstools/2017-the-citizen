Talk about luck a Gauteng man who struck lucky twice on the PowerBall game has come forward to claim his winnings, said lottery operator Ithuba this morning. The winner, who has asked not to be named, bought his two winning tickets with the same numbers from two different stores in the East of Johannesburg. Yes, two tickets won in the same draw! The winner, who has been a regular lottery player since inception, told Ithuba he has, without fail, always played specific numbers and trusted that someday his numbers would come through. He told Ithuba he bought the first ticket on a Friday morning while on his way to work and forgot that he had played, and made another bet later the same day. On that PowerBall draw, the jackpot was R30.6 million and there were four winning tickets, each worth R7.6 million. The lucky Johannesburg-based engineer walked away with R15.2 million. The PowerBall draw took place on March 24. The first winning ticket was bought at the One Stop Spar in Kempton Park, where he played for R45 and the second winning ticket was purchased at Brenthurst Supermarket, Brakpan, where he also played for another R45. Upon discovering he had won, he kept on checking and rechecking his two tickets in disbelief. The winner says he plans on investing most of his winnings to go towards retirement and settle all of his debts, including his bond and car repayments. The winner informed Ithuba that he had also been one of those affected by the Johannesburg floods last year in which his car was swept away by the floods. This is indeed a miracle, as I can now pay off the debt I had incurred for the new vehicle and also help those in need around me, said the PowerBall winner.
