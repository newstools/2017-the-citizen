A seven-year-old girl is fighting for her life in a Durban hospital after falling into a swimming pool at a popular hotel in Umhlanga, north of the city, on Saturday morning, paramedics said. Rescue Care paramedics together with other services arrived on the scene just after 11.45am to find the little girl in a critical condition, Rescue Care spokesperson Ceron Lennox said. The child had been found in the pool of the resort. A doctor had done CPR [cardiopulmonary resuscitation] and managed to resuscitate the little girl before advanced life support paramedics took over placing the child on a ventilator. Due to the severity of the injury a decision was made to call in the EMRS Air Mercy helicopter to airlift the child to a Durban hospital for the urgent care that she required. At this stage the exact events leading up to the child falling in are unknown; however SAPS [the South African Police Service] were on [the] scene and will be investigating further, Lennox said.
