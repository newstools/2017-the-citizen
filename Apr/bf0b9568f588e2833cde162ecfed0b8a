Rashford opened the scoring at Old Trafford after being played in by man-of-the-match Ander Herrera, who scored United&#8217;s second goal as manager Jose Mourinho enjoyed a victory over his former club. It was Rashford&#8217;s ninth goal of a season that has seen the 19-year-old find life tough after a superb breakthrough campaign last term. &#8220;I think Marcus is a great player,&#8221; Italy full-back Darmian said. &#8220;He is still very, very young and I think he is very important for us. &#8220;With his quality, he can be one of the top players, one of the most important players, in the world. &#8220;I think he is very good in every part of the game, he has a very good shot, movement, speed.&#8221; He added: &#8220;Sometimes for a striker, it is normal there is a not as good period (scoring goals) but I hope he continues like this&#8230;.because it helps the team to reach their objective.&#8221;
