Smiling Blue Eyes looked a possible Wilgerbosdrift SA Triple Tiara winner after her impressive victory in the Gauteng Fillies Guineas over 1600m at Turffontein and was all the rage to win the SA Fillies Classic over 1800m. However, trainer Sean Tarry warned there was a virus in the yard and the grey filly appears to have been its next victim as she trailed in 13 lengths behind Mike de Kock-trained Orchid Island, who fought off the challenge of Safe Harbour to win by a neck. On Saturday 6 May the two are set to square off in a series decider in the R1-million Wilgerbosdrift SA Oaks (Grade 2) over 2450m. Horses from the two yards have dominated the Triple Tiara and Triple Crown events this year and they could do so again. Geoff Woodruff, however, may have other thoughts as Bi Pot, hopelessly out at the weights based on merit ratings, managed to finish third in the Classic, beaten just 0.45 lengths and could be even better over this distance. The SA Oaks is one of four Grade 2 races to be run on Champions Day, which also includes four Grade 1 events the R4- million Premier s Champions Challenge over 2000m, the R2- million SA Derby over 2450m, the R1-million Computaform Sprint over 1000m and the R1-million SA Nursery over 1160m.
