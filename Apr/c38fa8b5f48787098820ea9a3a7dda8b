While in America last year, Nkosinathi &#8216;Black Coffee&#8217; Maphumulo tried working with American artist Usher, but things did not work out because of the American artist&#8217;s view on what African music should sound like. In an interview on Metro FM, Black Coffee said he met up with Usher&#8217;s manager to arrange that the two artists work together on a song. The manager told Black Coffee he liked the &#8220;African&#8221; vibe and asked that he come up with something that had an &#8220;African&#8221; sound to it. With enthusiasm, Black Coffee said he told the manager that he already had something that he wanted the &#8216;Crush&#8217; hit maker to listen to. &#8220;The following day the response came, and the manager said: &#8216;No, he says the song is a bit too modern, he wanted something African,&#8217; and I&#8217;m like: &#8216;Maybe not&#8217;,&#8221; he said. Black Coffee said Usher&#8217;s interpretation of Africa differed from his. &#8220;We&#8217;re not in the jungle right now, Africa is different, Africa is a totally different place. Other people still want to hear the bongos of music, and I&#8217;m cool to do that, but only if it fits. For me, if I want to do a song with you, this is the vision I have, so the song might not happen because I&#8217;m not African enough,&#8221; he said.

Diddy. Rumour at the time was that Diddy was working on a dance album, something that was not true, according to Coffee. No, I even assumed he wanted me for a dance album, but that s not the case. He s worked on his last hip-hop album. I finally sat down with him, and he was explaining to me the vision, like the sound he was trying to get.&#8221; Read more: Black Coffee opens up about working with P. Diddy, beef with AKA &nbsp;
