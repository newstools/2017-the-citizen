The 18th edition of the Cape Town International Jazz Festival kicked off on Friday. This year s festival has drawn a slightly younger hip-hop and pop culture conscious crowned with the introduction of international acts such as Californian-born Cassandra Monique, better known as Andra Day, 32. Day is both a singer and songwriter. She received the Billboard Powerhouse Award and the Soul Train Award for her recent album and her concerns about gender equality and other social issues facing the youth of the world. Speaking at a press conference, Day touched on the importance of promoting schools which teach the arts to the youth, not only as an alternative but as equivalent and parallel to the usual form of education. One of my goals for this year is to bring an awareness of the importance of the arts in society, she said. VUDU, a collective of four young musicians from Port Elizabeth and the winners of the 2016 Young Legends talent search, are at the festival for the first time. The group expressed their gratitude for the opportunity to perform on such a great stage. They encouraged young people to get more involved in jazz. South African Afro-pop jazz legend musician Tshepo Tshola also touched on the importance of collaborations among artists of all musical genres. The Lesotho-born artist is among the heavyweight headliners and is celebrating 47 years in the music industry. For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
