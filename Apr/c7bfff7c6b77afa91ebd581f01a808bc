A Munich-based fitness start-up issued a grovelling apology to the World Cup winner over a fake April 1 story, which hit the German media last Saturday, falsely claiming he had invested in them. The story even contained a fake quote attributed to the Bayern Munich star after an employee decided to circulate an internal newsletter to the German media without the knowledge of the company&#8217;s bosses. &#8220;It was an April Fool&#8217;s joke which should have been sent exclusively to our members in a newsletter,&#8221; explained the company&#8217;s red-faced co-founder. However, the stunt quickly backfired and although the firm apologised several times, Lahm failed to see the funny side with the prank having generated plenty of free publicity for the start-up. &#8220;I&#8217;m taking advice and bringing the matter to the detailed attention of a lawyer,&#8221; said the 33-year-old, who will retire from all football in June, in a statement. &#8220;The personal apology reached me, but nevertheless, the company has overstepped the mark with this action. &#8220;We will now get in direct contact and look for a solution.&#8221; The firm has already suggested making a donation to Lahm&#8217;s charity, The Philipp Lahm Foundation, in an attempt to make amends.
