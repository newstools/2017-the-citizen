DA leader Mmusi Maimane in a press conference on Sunday in Cape Town announced the outcome of discussions in his party over what to do regarding the controversial tweets posted by Western Cape premier Helen Zille. He said it had been a &#8220;very difficult decision&#8221; by the party&#8217;s federal executive to institute formal disciplinary steps against Zille. Maimane said that what made it difficult was that Zille had a sterling track record as a politician who had &#8220;consistently fought oppression&#8221; and grown the DA more than any other leader. However, he said he was committed to &#8220;the project&#8221; of growing the DA and making it attractive to a broader cross-section of South Africa&#8217;s population, particularly black people, and no one would stand in the way of achieving the goals of that project. He said the tweets by Zille on March 16 about her trip to Singapore, and which gave the impression that she may have been defending the legacy of colonialism, amounted to a possible case of misconduct according to the party&#8217;s constitution, since she had potentially brought the party into disrepute. &#8220;This is not confined only to the series of tweets by Ms. Zille,&#8221; he said, explaining that her comments following the tweets had exacerbated the matter and appeared to have further impacted negatively on the image of the party, harming its good name. &#8220;I have confidence in the independence and institutional strength of our structures.&#8221; He said he knew due process would be followed and the correct decision would be arrived at following disciplinary steps by following due process. He said the party&#8217;s disciplinary panel was &#8220;indeed a panel of independently minded, legally qualified individuals&#8221; and he would have no way of influencing their findings on Zille&#8217;s guilt or innocence. Maimane said that his party was resolute in bringing an &#8220;accountable government that serves the people of this country in 2019&#8221; and expressed a commitment to nonracialism and accountable government. &#8220;We are fast running out of time &#8230; [since] an organisation led by President Jacob Zuma and the Guptas [is destroying South Africa]. &#8220;We will be marching on Friday to the ANC&#8217;s headquarters Luthuli House, calling on the ANC to support our motion of no confidence in Jacob Zuma.&#8221; He said the march would be peaceful, but it was an opportunity for the ANC to finally set right its continued wrongs in supporting Zuma The DA leader added he was hoping the motion could take place before the official reopening of parliament on May 9, and he would be meeting on Monday with his fellow opposition leaders to discuss the removal of Zuma. He encouraged South Africans not to feel hopeless and to remember that the power remained in their hands through the power of their votes. &#8220;The destiny of this nation lies in all of our hands &#8230; ultimately it is us the people who will triumph. There is no greater moment than now.&#8221;
