Cheetahs supporters have become so nervous over the possibility that their team might be cut from Super Rugby that they&#8217;ve set up an online petition to keep the side safe. Regional radio station OFM, a media partner of the union, recently took it upon themselves to take this course of action. Click here to view the petition. The South African Rugby Union&#8217;s (Saru) general council will meet on Thursday, where they are expected to decide which local side(s) get the chop as Sanzaar &#8211; Super Rugby&#8217;s governing body &#8211; look to streamline the competition from 18 to 15 teams. The embattled Kings are virtually guaranteed of being ditched but various reports allege the Cheetahs will join them. &#8220;For the Cheetahs it s a fight for survival and Central South Africa (has) a duty to keep the team in the competition,&#8221; the petition states. &#8220;The region is (a) breeding ground of Springbok rugby.&#8221; A rash of injuries, particularly in the backline, has seen Franco Smith&#8217;s troops struggle in this year&#8217;s campaign. Ironically though their two out of five wins to date is still better than the Bulls. However, it&#8217;s understood Saru also need to take financial considerations into account as Bloemfontein&#8217;s market is simply too small to attract consistently decent crowds. But the petition begs local supporters to show that this notion is wrong. &#8220;It is also up to the supporters to start backing their team they claimed unwavering loyalty to and start turning up in droves to the home match. Lack of support could be a determining factor.&#8221; Meanwhile, former Springbok flyhalf Joel Stransky believes South Africa can only remain competitive if both the Kings and Cheetahs are cut. &#8220;Financially they are not sustainable. They have very low supporter bases during Super Rugby,&#8221; he told New Zealand&#8217;s Radio Sport. &#8220;They&#8217;re in the middle of the country, they churn out great young talents but they are not places that can economically sustain a team. It&#8217;s the only way.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
