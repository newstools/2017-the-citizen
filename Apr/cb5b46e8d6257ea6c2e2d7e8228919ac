For 22 years the second weekend of August was known as Oppikoppi weekend where thousands of revellers embraced Limpopo s dust and the best South African and international music &#8211; until now. Now the organisers of Oppikoppi, Hilltop Live, announced the festival would take place from 5 to 7 October &#8211; the same weekend as Rocking The Daisies. The announcement says, &#8220;This was not a smallanyana decision. When we started the rock music loving hedonistic bar parties in 1994 we were like adult little kids and did not know what we were doing. Over the years Oppikoppi has become a South African benchmark festival on the international calendar, and 2016 just made it super clear that we had to be outside of the European summer calendar if we did want a long-term festival with a strong and relevant South African and international lineup. And keep growing. Moving the festival also opens up a few alluring cooperation opportunities which makes a great deal of sense for SA bands, crews and fans.&#8221; The organisers of Rocking The Daisies, Steyn Entertainment, was proud to announce that this would be the first time in the history of SA where two promoters would work together on this scale. The combined attendance at both festivals is expected to reach 45 000, as fans descend on Darling, Western Cape and Northam, Limpopo, for two of SA&#8217;s biggest music and lifestyle festivals. Oppikoppi&#8217;s organisers came under fire in December for not managing to pay band The Kiffness for their 2016 performance at the festival. Oppikoppi organisers said the cancellation of Ramfest was one of the reasons they had trouble with cash flow. &#8220;Largely due to the rand-dollar we had to cancel Ramfest, park a few other projects and took a big hit on the Oppikoppi festival itself. Not a nice year for live music in SA in general, and one that left quite a hole in our pockets. &#8220;(And quite a few other SA promoters/festivals),&#8221; the organisers said on the festival&#8217;s Facebook page. The latest announcement might ease the financial straits for Oppikoppi&#8217;s organisers &#8211; especially when it comes to paying headlining acts. Previously Oppikoppi has been headlined by international bands such as The Eagles of Death Metal, Sum 41, Bullet for my Valentine and Jimmy Eat World. The new partnership could open up both festivals to feature even more prominent acts. However, both festivals also provide an important platform for up-and-coming bands. This year&#8217;s Oppikoppi is expected to still feature seven stages, about 160 different bands and acts and 20 000 revellers.
