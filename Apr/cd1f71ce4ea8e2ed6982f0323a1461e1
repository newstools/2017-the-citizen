The Bulls suffered the ultimate embarrassment when they lost 20-21 to the Sunwolves in Tokyo on Saturday. It just illustrated again how far the men from Pretoria are from being a force again. Remember, this is the same Sunwolves that earlier lost 83-17 to the Hurricanes. Who was the star of this match? Slim pickings obviously but Bulls centre Burger Odendaal scored a brilliant individual try and even kicked well on occasion. Key events and moments The Bulls weren&#8217;t ever really in control, so when wing Travis Ismaiel went over in the corner in the third quarter to score, it gave the menf from Pretoria the illusion of a comfortable 20-11 lead. Seven minutes later, centre Jan Serfontein was yellow carded for not rolling away. It was a turning point as Takaaki Nakazuru went over shortly afterwards to give the Sunwolves a foothold. Rather undeservingly, the Bulls still had a chance to win when replacement flyhalf Francois Brummer had a shot at goal but missed. This was arguably the poorest performance by a Bulls side for a decade. They still don&#8217;t possess the basic skills to even try and implement their new running game. The amount of knocks they made trying to complete off-loads was astounding and the decision-making is non-existent. That was illustrated by their poor kicking game. Filo Tiatia&#8217;s Sunwolves are by no means a powerhouse. They still keep their opponents in games with errors but against this hapless bunch Bulls, they deserved to win because they kept their heads so well.
