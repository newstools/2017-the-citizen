Minority white-rights party Front National said in a statement prior to the ANC&#8217;s national working committee press conference on Wednesday that it was clear President Jacob Zuma was likely to survive as president of both the ANC and the country. However, they don&#8217;t believe this is a bad thing as the ongoing divisions he is causing in the ANC and among &#8220;black parties&#8221; will possibly leave them all weaker in 2019, allowing white people to pick up the pieces. The ANC&#8217;s notes leaked on Tuesday night already, and it was clear the party was planning to rally behind the president. This proved to be the case. Secretary-general Gwede Mantashe announced they had accepted that Zuma had axed Pravin Gordhan due to the working relationship between the former finance minister and the president breaking down. They showed support for the decision despite it having led to a ratings downgrade for the country to &#8220;junk&#8221; status, apparent division in the ANC&#8217;s top six and turmoil throughout the country, with further protests planned. Mantashe said the ANC wished the newly appointed ministers well. In his statement, Front National&#8217;s spokesperson Daniel Lotter incorrectly quoted a Citizen report claiming former president Thabo Mbeki said this week Zuma should stay in power. However, the article in question was from November 2016, and quoted Mbeki as saying that firing Zuma alone would not be enough to solve the ANC&#8217;s problems. Mbeki said the problems in the ruling party should not be blamed only on Zuma but on the entire NEC, of which Zuma was merely a part. There are wrong things that are happening with the ANC, but I think it s the fault of the collective leadership. For instance, the ANC has a national executive committee: a body which takes decisions for the ANC between the conferences where the whole party meets, and that is the body that must take responsibility for what s gone wrong. Even if you removed President Zuma, let us say just hypothetically, it would change nothing if you didn t change the national executive committee. So you need to look at the whole national executive committee, the decisions and actions they have taken and not taken.&#8221; On Wednesday, writing in Afrikaans, Lotter said it was &#8220;crystal clear&#8221; that Zuma would survive another motion of no confidence in parliament. &#8220;What about the proposed mass action this coming Friday? A person should perhaps start by asking: is Zuma the problem or is he just the face of the problem? Is it indeed Zuma that has brought the economy to the level of junk status, or is it 20 years of ANC policies such as affirmative action, black economic empowerment, racism and land reform? Could Zuma do all the damage alone, or did he have the support of nearly two-thirds of an elected parliament?&#8221; Lotter said that removing Zuma would be like snipping a malignant mole while the underlying cancer spread undisturbed. &#8220;Further, we should keep in mind that black opposition is not opposed to the ANC but to Zuma as a person. [Julius] Malema&#8217;s fight is with Zuma. Zwelinzima Vavi&#8217;s fight is with Zuma. Mmusi Maimane&#8217;s fight is with Zuma. Pravin Gordhan&#8217;s fight is with Zuma. The SACP&#8217;s fight is with Zuma not with the ANC and its policies.&#8221; He said that if they helped to get rid of Zuma they might merely be removing a source of division among black politicians. &#8220;A Zuma successor is certainly not going to let go of the policy directions that hobble the economy. What are we achieving, then, other than helping to repair divisions within the ANC? That&#8217;s the last thing we want. The more they jump each other and fight, the better for all the minorities in the country!&#8221; He warned white people to think twice before joining Friday&#8217;s protest as Zuma and others had allegedly successfully convinced the black majority in the country that the problem with the economy was &#8220;white monopoly capital&#8221; and that white people were the cause of South Africa&#8217;s problems. &#8220;We should thus not object when we aren&#8217;t welcomed with open arms on Friday. We&#8217;ve known for a long time that the black majority doesn&#8217;t actually think much of the anti-Zuma sentiment of the white man.&#8221; He said that joining the protest would therefore be futile. Zuma would survive until 2019 and the best hope for white people would be that the conflict among black political blocs would rage so heavily that, by the time of the next election, they suffered enough losses to allow white people to &#8220;unite and speak out against the failure of multiculturalism&#8221; and have a strong mandate for white self-determination and minority rights. &#8220;If the Communists fight among themselves, we say: Thank you Father and leave them in peace to beat each other black and blue. It&#8217;s ultimately not our fight and that&#8217;s why you have to ask yourself: Should I really go and poke my nose into a fight between a bunch of terrorists who have just one thing in common: They consider me their enemy?&#8221; Front National was formed in late 2013 and contested the 2014 national elections without winning a seat.
