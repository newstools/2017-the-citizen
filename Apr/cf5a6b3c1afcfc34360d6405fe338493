After announcing her exit from Metro FM, saying she was leaving because the station only told her about the line-up changes to her show an hour before going on air, evidence has emerged proving otherwise. Reports had said Metro FM tried to meet with Bonang Matheba since last week to try to sort out differences between her and Lerato Kganyago, but to no avail. Bonang reportedly avoided the meetings and threatened the station, thinking they would change their mind and not pair her up with Kganyago. Once she lost the battle, she then handed in a resignation letter, claiming she was leaving as a matter of &#8220;principle&#8221; and not because she did not want to work with Kganyago. Now Times Live is reporting that it is in possession of WhatsApp messages, emails and records of phone calls between Metro FM station manager Sibongile Mtayli, Metro FM programme manager Tony Soglo and Bonang, proving the station made several attempts to meet with her. The presenter, however, denied receiving meeting requests, and allegedly failed to arrive for scheduled meetings. In one case, she allegedly agreed to a meeting only to later say she knew nothing about it. She then told the publication the first time the SABC contacted her about the changes was on Sunday, when she told them she was with her family. Bonang confirmed her resignation from Metro FM on Monday, writing on Twitter: After three years of making magic on the Front Row, I can confirm that I have officially stepped down as the host of the show. I will miss my Metro FM family dearly, as they say all good things do come to an end .Looking forward to the next chapter of my radio life. My heart is broken. I was told about the changes to my show an hour before going on air today, she tweeted yesterday, causing a storm among fans who were not happy about the news. Also read: You&#8217;re an idiot!
