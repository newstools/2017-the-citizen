Veteran TV commentator Peter Alliss is in trouble for yet another potentially sexist remark. The 86-year-old, who works for the BBC, made the comment after Sergio Garcia celebrated his at the Masters in Augusta last weekend. Garcia was greeted by his fiancee, Angela Akins, on the green when Alliss could be heard saying: &#8220;She&#8217;s got the shortest skirt on campus.&#8221; Also read: Ernie Els reminds us sporting fairy tales don t always happen Alliss was under the impression he was making the comment off-mic but it was nonetheless picked up by a live microphone. &#8220;Whilst believing he was off air Peter made a lighthearted remark which he now knows was inappropriate,&#8221; a BBC spokesman said. But it&#8217;s unlikely critics will give Alliss the benefit of the doubt. He&#8217;s known for previous utterances that could also be considered sexist. &#8220;No matter how you wrap it up, women will never be able to do things that men can do,&#8221; Alliss told Newsweek this month. Two years ago, Alliss soured another crowning moment in Dustin Johnson&#8217;s win in the British Open. &#8220;She is probably thinking &#8211; &#8216;if this goes in I get a new kitchen&#8217;,&#8221; Alliss said as Johnson executed the putt to win the tournament, referring to his wife Kim Barclay. The BBC then also had to apologise. For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
