Luthuli House has given shamed and suspended Western Cape chairperson Marius Fransman another chance to redeem himself. In a letter The Citizen has seen, the National Disciplinary Committee of Appeal (NDCA) said it had found that the matter should be referred back the disciplinary committee. Fransman was found guilty by the disciplinary committee on two charges of misconduct. This followed allegations of sexual assault earlier last year. He claimed the process was flawed and he had not been given a fair hearing. The NDCA said the charges should be reviewed by the disciplinary committee and should convene another hearing within 21 working days from April 3. Following the disciplinary hearing, Fransman s membership to the ANC was suspended for five years. The NDCA directive was signed by members Minister Naledi Pandor and Ngoako Ramatlhodi and chairperson Jeff Radebe. Fransman could not be reached for comment.
