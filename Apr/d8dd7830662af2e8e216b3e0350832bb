Former Olympic champions Chad le Clos and Cameron van der Burgh gained momentum on Thursday evening, storming to their second gold medals on day four of the SA National Aquatics Championships in Durban. Le Clos touched the wall in 1:55.00 in the men&#8217;s 200m butterfly final, achieving the qualifying mark for this year&#8217;s World Championships in Budapest and adding to the 200m freestyle title he earned the night before. He finished well clear of distance specialist Myles Brown, who settled for another silver medal in 1:59.77. Van der Burgh raced to gold in the 50m breaststroke final in 27.17, after defending his 100m crown earlier in the week. He was nearly a full second clear of Olympic sprint finalist Brad Tandy who grabbed second place in 28.16. Teenager Matthew Meyer narrowly missed out on a place in the 800m freestyle contest at the global championships, covering the distance 0.22 outside the required standard in 7:54.53.
