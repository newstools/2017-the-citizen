The Progressive Professionals Forum (PPF) on Wednesday said it was disgusted by Zapiro s cartoon depicting a woman wearing a dress of the South African flag being raped purportedly by the President . The cartoon, published in the Daily Maverick on Tuesday, depicts President Jacob Zuma closing his zip and saying to one of the controversial businessman Gupta brothers that she s all yours boss while a woman dressed in the SA flag is held down by three other characters. The cartoon has been criticised and praised on social media and radio talk shows. This is not the first time such despicable and racist cartoons were drawn by the same Zapiro on the president and his leadership, said the PPF in a statement issued by its secretary general, Zinhle Cele. The PPF said it expects the media in general and Zapiro in particular to bring stories and cartoons that build a united, non-racial, non-sexist South African as opposed this type of stereotype racial cartoons . PPF calls on Zapiro to refrain with immediate from his also barbaric, insensitive and racial undertone cartoons and be part of the builders of a better South Africa. The PPF said it was warning Zapiro that his continuous attack and depiction of black people as nothing else a primitive and barbaric lot will not be tolerated forever and must stop. We are calling on all non-racist and non-sexist progressive South Africans and in particular professionals to condemn this insulting cartoon so that the whole country is geared up to build non-racial, non-sexist democratic South Africa. Zapiro has defended his cartoon saying he did not take the depiction lightly. He said there was nothing in the cartoon that enjoys or revels in the idea of rape or gang rape.
