The SA Police Service (SAPS) under the umbrella of the National Police Music and Cultural Association (Polmusca) in partnership with the SAPS Tshwane West Cluster donated a number of things to Thuto Ke Lesedi Cr che at Itereleng Squatter Camp in Laudium. Polmusca donated a JOJO water tank since the cr che had a small JOJO tank that couldn&#8217;t sustain the cr che for a whole week. The cr che also received kiddies&#8217; chairs, groceries and snacks. Laudium station commander Johannes Britz expressed his gratitude towards the Polmusca members for making the day as dazzling as it was. He further said: &#8220;Social responsibility is each individual and organisation&#8217;s responsibility for fulfilling their civic duty through their action within the society.&#8221; Laudium Community Police Forum (CPF) chairperson Bilal Sattar said this kind act of generosity in assisting members of Laudium, especially the innocent children of Thuto ke Lesedi cr che, would not go unnoticed. William Mapaya from the Polmusca NEC thanked Polmusca members for their swift response in assisting with bringing a smile to the young ones&#8217; faces. &#8220;Every year Polmusca changes people&#8217;s lives by identifying homes and schools to make their challenging situations better,&#8221; said Mapaya. He added that through music and cultural activities they fought crime and were at the cr che to display to the kids that police were not monsters but people who wanted to make a difference in communities&#8217; lives. &#8220;Communities need to teach their kids what is right and what is wrong to root out the possibilities of them becoming susceptible to criminal activities at a young age,&#8221; Mapaya said. Women&#8217;s Network Champion Colonel Mabena thanked everyone for their attendance and support. Mabena said the generous gifts would go to good use, and kids were smiling today to see the other side of police. &#8220;What kids saw today will encourage them to want to become police officers one day. Polmusca is an important part of the community they build here,&#8221; said Mabena. Supplied. Supplied. Supplied. Supplied. Supplied.
