The president of the newly launched South African Federation of Trade Unions, Mac Chabalala, has warned authorities to put their house in order and end the road carnage in the country. The trade unionist was reacting to the deaths of at least 27 people, mainly schoolchildren, when a school taxi crashed into a truck near Bronkhorstpruit in Mpumalanga on Friday. The minibus burst into flames after the crash. Chabalala said Saftu would be forced to act if people, especially schoolchildren, continued to die as a result of negligence and laxity in the implementation of road safety laws and regulations. &#8220;It is enough, we are sick and tired of this. As Saftu we would have to do something if Angie (Motshekga) and those MECs fail to handle this situation properly,&#8221; said Chabalala. He passed the federation&#8217;s condolences to the relatives of the diseased. In his election acceptance speech and closing remarks at the federation&#8217;s inaugural congress in Boksburg, Chabalala said the working class should work to take over state power. He said the federation said no vote should be wasted in 2019. &#8220;Our task is to replace capitalism with socialism,&#8221; Chabalala said. To think that you can replace Jacob Zuma with Cyril Ramaphosa is a myth and believing that electing Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma is going to end capitalism, is a myth,&#8221; said Chabalala.
