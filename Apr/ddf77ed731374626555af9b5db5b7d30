Meet John McCroy, the man who made headlines in the US in 2014 for giving the worst excuse any man could ever come up with for failing to pay his child&#8217;s maintenance. McCroy has three children by three different mothers. In an old video that has recently resurfaced on social media, a man can be seen being interviewed by Fox Now on why he failed to pay maintenance. &#8220;I was ineligible to pay, I was in the hospital, I died in a car accident,&#8221; he tells the reporter. When asked to explain how he died in the accident, McCroy says: &#8220;No further questions.&#8221; Watch the video posted on YouTube by KevOnStage: &nbsp;
