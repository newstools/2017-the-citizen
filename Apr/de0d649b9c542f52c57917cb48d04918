The Kings were superb in scoring 26 unanswered points to record a brilliant 26-24 win over the Waratahs in Sydney on Friday. It was just reward for a competitive tour to Australia and also backed up the coaching staff&#8217;s words earlier in the week that the men from Port Elizabeth are growing weekly. Who was the star in this match? The Kings had numerous heroes but Andisa Ntsila definitely stood out a bit more. This was his first game at eighthman and the 23-year-old hardly put a foot wrong. He tackled well but it&#8217;s his ball-carrying ability that stood out as well as being an effective link in attacking movements. South Western Districts &#8211; a regional partner of the Kings &#8211; are certainly providing some hidden gems to this team. Key themes and events The Kings for the umpteenth time started this game badly. Simple errors led to all three the Waratahs&#8217; opening tries &#8211; a missed catch from a kick; a knock-on on the attack and an intercept. Cameron Clark&#8217;s intercept was especially painful because the Kings were playing against 14 men. Prop Justin Forwood&#8217;s try just before half-time gave the Kings their momentum. But the manner in which they score &#8211; a driving maul &#8211; was the key. Scrumhalf Louis Schreuder charged down a kick initially and quick, patient handling saw him burst over. It was a massive injection of confidence, showing the Kings that you make your own luck sometimes. Despite fullback Coyi Banda rounding off a sweeping attacking move, hooker Mikey Willemse&#8217;s try from a driving maul was significant. It showcased the Kings&#8217; ability to adapt and, in many ways, their calmness in the second half too. Too many times on this tour have the men from the Eastern Cape shown a lack of composure from promising positions. The set-pieces have been, strangely a problem for the Kings to date, but in this game the forwards really upped their game. Only one line-out and scrum were lost the entire game. In fact, the Waratahs conceded a penalty try from a powerful Kings push. It would&#8217;ve been immensely satisfying for coach Deon Davids to see that. As deserved as this win was, further questions need to be asked about Australian rugby. The Waratahs are supposed to be the top dogs in the country.
