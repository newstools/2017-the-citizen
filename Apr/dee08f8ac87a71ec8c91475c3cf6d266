Three police officers and two fans also suffered minor injuries in clashes between police and the travelling supporters in one of central Madrid&#8217;s tourist hotspots, Plaza Mayor, at 2200 local time (2000GMT) on Tuesday night. &#8220;Eight hooligans were arrested for public disorder and vandalism,&#8221; a police spokesperson told AFP. Videos showed riot police charging at the Leicester fans, who had gathered to drink in the various bars and restaurants in the Plaza Mayor, a spot often invaded by travelling fans for Champions League matches. &#8220;There was a group of 70 hooligans when the police charged,&#8221; said a spokesperson for the municipal emergency services. &#8220;On the ground we attended five people, three police officers and two English ultras for cuts and bruises, but nobody was taken to hospital.&#8221; The police source said the intervention was caused by Leicester fans &#8220;throwing bottles at the police.&#8221;
