The African National Congress (ANC) said on Thursday that Freedom Day was about assessing the work that still needed to be done to build a national democratic society. On April 27, 1994, millions of South Africans who were classified as black or coloured under apartheid voted in a national election for the first time. Such a society is one that is based on the best in human civilisation in terms of political and human freedoms, socio-economic rights, value systems and identity. It is also one that guarantees social emancipation and a better quality of life for all, especially the poor. The ruling party said that attaining social emancipation and bettering the lives of all South Africans required ongoing decisive action by society led by the ANC government to effect economic transformation and democratic consolidation. As South Africans mark this day we should give pause for reflection on the role each and every South African must play in advancing this vision, it said in a statement. It warned that some who benefited from apartheid would try to derail efforts to build an equal society. We must at all times remain vigilant of certain sections of our population who were the beneficiaries of the old order and are bent on either reversing this achievement or at best stall the progress. Various rallies have been organised to commemorate South Africa s 23rd year as a non-racial and democratic country, with President Jacob Zuma speaking in Umhlabuyalingana Municipality, northern KwaZulu-Natal.
