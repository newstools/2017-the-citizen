If you thought Lionel Messi&#8217;s dribbling skills were great, then you haven&#8217;t a Beagle&#8217;s ability to &#8220;create magic&#8221; on a soccer pitch. An English regional football game between Halesowen Town and Skelmersdale United at the weekend had to be suspended for a full six minutes after the fleet-footed dog invaded the pitch. The Beagle dodged several players as they tried to catch him but simply couldn&#8217;t. Eventually, Asa Charlton, a Halesowen defender, managed to catch him. Halesowen manager John Hill was initially livid over the break in play affecting the rhythm of the game though he lightened up afterwards. &#8220;It may have been really frustrating at the time but it s all good fun,&#8221; he told Express &amp; Star. And, in an ironic twist, he revealed who the owner of the dog is. &#8220;Asa managed to get the dog off the pitch, and I do believe it was Asa s family dog.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
