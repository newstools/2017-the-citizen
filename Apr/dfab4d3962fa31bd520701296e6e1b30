Dar es Salaam. A distinguished constitutional law expert and liberal conservative politician, Prof Palamagamba Kabudi, the newly-appointed minister for Constitution and Legal Affairs, has inherited challenges that have a lot to do with Tanzania s political future. His approach to handling them will determine his fate and legacy.Reviving the stalled constitution writing process, ensuring the respect for freedom of expression and spearheading the protection of the rule of law, both within and outside the government system are the key issues at stake.It is no secret that for him to tackle the three issues against the political direction, which the current government takes, he will have to play a delicate balancing act: meeting expectations of wananchi and right activists while protecting the interests and wishes of President John Magufuli and the party he leads, CCM.His first major promise last week that a task force was now reviewing the legal framework of on how to resume the Katiba making process has won him a certain degree of trust and confidence.But will he sustain the zeal to finalise the writing of a Katiba that reflect views of the majority and work to ensure Tanzanians fully enjoy constitutionally guaranteed freedom of expression, opinion and assembly and cast off perceptions that some executives are able the law without touching on the interests of CCM hardliners?These are some of questions that the actions of Prof Kabudi will be answering in the course of fulfilling his obligations.Rewriting KatibaProf Kabudi was part of the 30-member Constitution Review Commission (CRC) that was formed by former President Jakaya Kikwete in April 2012 to coordinate and supervise the constitution making process in the country.The team was tasked, among other things, to collect views of the people on what should be included in the mother law and was expected to complete the task by October 2013 with a target of having a new constitution by April 2014.The CRC team that was led by former AG and Prime Minister Joseph Warioba gathered opinion throughout the country and unveiled the draft constitution which to a large extent reflected the view of the majority in June 2013.After discussion by institution the CRC came up with the second draft of the constitution before the constitution assembly, which later passed the Proposed Constitution, which saw many issues in the draft constitution being reversed.Since then, the Katiba process has stagnated and referendum to validate the Proposed Constitution, which was to take place before the 2015 General Elections under the Referendum Act, 2013 was postponed to pave the way for election preparations.To date the referendum has not been held despite growing calls for the country to resume the constitution making.And with the growing signs that CCM is not ready to expedite the process which, after all, is not a priority under its 2015 election manifesto has made Kabudi s work more complex. His predecessor, Dr Harrison Mwakyembe, was quoted sometimes last year as saying the government would resume the process, indicating that it could follow after the 2016/2017 budget.But it took less than three months before President Magufuli buried any hope of having a new Katiba soon when he declared at his meeting with media houses on the eve of marking one year in office that it was not his government s priority.He told media practitioners that he covered 42,500 kilometres during his countrywide campaigns without making a single pledge on the new constitution. President Magufuli was clear that he was concentrating on delivering his election campaign promised, which did not include the push for a new Constitution.More recently, CCM publicity and ideology secretary Hamphrey Polepole, who was also CRC member, admitted during an interview with a local TV station that it was difficult to resume the process before the President sets the country in one direction. By this time even Dr Mwakyembe who had promised to restart the process had changed his mind. What card then will Prof Kabudi have to play to revitalise the process and at the same time win the confidence of the President who has publicly stated his position over new Katiba and fulfilling expectations of wananchi is the question many are asking.But people who know him are confident that the new minister has capabilities to play his cards smartly while avoiding possible fallout with his bosses. He has the convincing power and influential. If he had consulted the President before promising to work on new Katiba, then we are sure things will proceed but if he didn t consult the president whose stance is already known, then we should not expect anything new, says Dr Hellen-Kijo Bisimba, executive director of the Legal and Human Rights Centre (LHRC).Her views are echoed by the chairman of the Tanzania Constitutional Forum (Jukwaa la Katiba) Deus Kibamba who feel that Prof Kabudi s promise on Katiba can only materalise if the move has the blessings of the cabinet or Head of State. The major issue here is consultation. I have serious doubts if there has been adequate consultation before such crucial statements are issued, he said. Kabudi also made the statement after he was asked by the parliamentary committee. I am not sure if he consulted with the President. Another challenge that the new minister will have to confront is how to bury the growing perception that the current administration is shrinking the democratic space for the opposition and civil society.President Magufuli s has indefinitely restricted activities of political parties, saying the rime for politicking was over and that he needed a space to deliver on his campaign promises without distraction from his political opponents.The decision to ban the opposition rallies until the 2020 General Elections has been roundly criticised by human rights groups as unconstitutional. The government is also accused of suppressing the freedom of expression.Last week, members of the Parliamentarian Constitution and Legal Affairs Committee said individual citizens, human rights groups and activists are being denied their constitution right to criticise the government.Dozens have been arraigned since last year for posting on social media opinion criticising the President. Regional and district commissioners are also being accused of frenziedly making unconstitutional orders and statements that has in recent months raised concern among parliamentarian and ordinary wananchi to the extent of being seen as behaving as if they are above the law.The impunity with which many government executive have been breaking the law is also a tough task professor Kabudi will have to deal with and stop the growing perception that some people are above the law. Prof Kabudi is leading a ministry under which the office of the Attorney General is, and currently there is growing perception that the President is not adequately advised on legal issues, so he will have to look at the role the AG plays in advising the Head of State. When the President bans political rallies until 2020 this is a constitutional issue and the AG s duty is to advise the president that freedom of assembly is guaranteed by the constitution and breach of the constitution is a serious mistake, says Dr Bisimba.Mr Kibamba says there is no doubt that the freedom of expression and assembly is under attack in Tanzania and that Kabudi will have to do an extra job.
