Police union Popcru has warned axed Hawks boss Berning Ntlemeza that his arrogance would not win him his job back . The ex-top cop remains adamant he is still technically head of the elite unit, despite a high court ruling that he be removed immediately from his post. New police minister Fikile Mbalula recently warned Ntlemeza to toe the line or face the consequences after the axed Hawks head s lawyer, Comfort Ngidi, indicated that he would report for duty next week. Popcru spokesperson Richard Mamabolo told The Citizen on Thursday the elite crime-fighting unit should be more concerned with policing than politics. Nltemeza s arrogance will not assist him, because the courts have already taken a decision and the minister is not going to appeal that decision, he said. The minister has appointed an acting head and we are confident that she will continue the work because we don t want to see a Hawks that is working on political issues instead of policing criminal activities. But Ntlemeza insists the law is on his side, with his lawyer telling reporters that according to the South African Police Act 68 of 1995, Section 17DA, only parliament can remove him. We don t have to ask for permission. General Ntlemeza is still in office, said Ngidi.
