It&#8217;s something that happens to the very best entertainers. Even Fred Astaire must have slipped a few times. But rapper Cassper Nyovest, real name Refiloe Phoolo, did a little more slipping than jumping when he took to the stage this past weekend to perform his hit track Jump at uShaka Marine World in Durban.

He tried to make his tumble seem like nothing (he jumped up faster than you can say Bruce Lee), and the crowd was actually pretty impressed at his recovery. They really got into the song.
