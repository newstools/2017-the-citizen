Newly appointed police minister Fikile Mbalula said the fight between Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) boss Robert McBride and acting national police commissioner Khomotso Phahlane must come to an end. Mbalula was speaking at the announcement of the new acting Hawks head, Lieutenant-General Yolisa Matakata, on Thursday and said the ongoing spat had an impact on the public s perception of law enforcement agencies. Matakata replaced Berning Ntlemeza as Hawks boss following a court ruling, which enforced a previous ruling that had set aside his appointment. According to Timeslive, Mbalula said he was tired of the ongoing war between McBride and Phahlane, adding that the unnecessary tension had to come to an end. He added that both men had jobs to do and needed to get on with it. Mbalula said he intended to address the confrontation between the two and would have a sit down with each of them again following an initial meeting with each of them separately. He added that Ipid should be allowed to do its work and assured McBride that he would protect him to ensure he was able to carry out his mandate. McBride and Phahlane have been at each other s throats for months now following the directorate s investigation into the top cop for defeating the ends of justice. The investigation relates to another probe into to an upmarket house Phahlane had built in the exclusive Sable Hills Waterfront Estate, north of Pretoria.
