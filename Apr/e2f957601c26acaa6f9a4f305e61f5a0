AB de Villiers had the cricketing world buzzing again on Monday evening with a magnificent innings in his first Indian Premier League (IPL) match of 2017. Turning out for the Royal Challengers Bangalore, the Proteas one-day skipper whacked an unbeaten 89 off just 46 deliveries against the Kings XI Punjab. De Villiers was truly at his brilliant best. Showing no signs of a sore back, he went on his knee numerous times to hit the faster men square for six. And when they bowled fuller, De Villiers merely carvede those balls for four.

She told me that she backs me and to stay calm and that she was on her way, arriving tomorrow, so I think that was the inspiration.&#8221; Regardless of his own doubts, many prominent cricket stars were in awe on Twitter.
