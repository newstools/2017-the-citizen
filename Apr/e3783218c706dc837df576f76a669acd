Two-time defending champion Caroline W stmann pulled out with a hamstring injury of the 56km Two Oceans Ultra-marathon in the early stages of the race on Saturday. Just after the 11km mark, W stmann decided she could no longer bear the discomfort of the injured hamstring and ended her chances of a hat-trick of victories in the race. It s very disappointing, especially now watching the race from the sidelines, said W stmann. I m disappointed to not get to see the views and feel the vibe of Chapman s Peak, but I think I made the right call. It is not known yet what the injury means for her preparation and participation in the Comrades Marathon in the first week of June. In 2015, a relatively unknown W stmann caused quite a stir by winning the Two Oceans and the Comrades in the same year. Last year she was hampered by severe cramps over the last few kilometres in Comrades, which meant she was unable to complete the unique double again. Still, her performance was one of the gutsiest ever in the history of the race as she basically hobbled her way to a second-place finish. African News Agency (ANA)
