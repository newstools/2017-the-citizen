Speeding, overloading, and driving without a licence are the leading offences identified since the start of the Easter holiday period, the Road Traffic Management Cosporation (RTMC) said on Saturday. A total of 4 500 motorists have received traffic fines for various traffic offences so far. About 368 were given fines for speeding, 232 for overloading of goods, and 228 for driving without licences, RTMC spokesman Simon Zwane said. Driving unroadworthy vehicles was another significant contributor to crashes which had already claimed the lives of many people around the country. Many vehicles that were stopped and inspected this weekend were found to have defects which rendered them unroadworthy. Tyres, direction indicators, and parking brakes were found to be defective in most vehicles, Zwane said. The RTMC urged motorist to use the holiday period to fix whatever defects their vehicles may have before making their trip back home from the holidays. Traffic law enforcement operations would remain in place for the entire holiday period to ensure the safety of pedestrians and passengers. Road safety education and awareness campaigns were continuing in all identified hotpots to encourage road users to take responsibility for their safety, Zwane said. African News Agency (ANA)
