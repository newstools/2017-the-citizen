Callan Murray has been having a great season and the young man could well score another couple of winners on Friday at Fairview on the turf track. His first opportunity comes in Race 1 where he rides Window s Lamp in this Maiden Juvenile Plate for fillies over 1200m. He has been aboard this two-year-old daughter of Go Deputy in her last two outings and with each run she s edged closer to the winner. She stayed on well last time out when only 1.25 lengths in third behind Precious Pansy. This Yvette Bremner-trained filly will jump from stall No 7. Although Road To Indy has proven rather costly to follow of late, this son of Distorted Humor will be looking to return to winning ways when lining up in Race 6, a MR 93 Divided Handicap over 1600m. Murray retains the ride and the pair will have quite a lot in their favour. They jump from No 1 draw and as an added advantage Road To Indy will shoulder 58kg. This four-year-old gelding has been heavily backed in his last couple of starts so one can assume his work at home has been most encouraging. The young rider could also close off the proceedings aboard Reef Of Fortune in Race 9, a MR 66 Handicap over 1200m. A son of Trippi, this four-year-old has run into the money in all of his last four outings and that looks unlikely to change on this occasion. That last run was over 1400m but the drop back to 1200m should be ideal. He will shoulder 59.5kg which, over this sort of trip, shouldn t prove too much of a disadvantage. Murray also excellent eachway chances in Race 5 and Race 7. In Race 5 he rides Coltrane. This Tara Laing-trained gelding disappointed in his first run in Port Elizabeth. He s faced stronger opposition and could produce further improvement. Murray rides Off To Gaul in Race 7, a MR 75 Handicap over 1600m, and this is another who should be included in all bets.
