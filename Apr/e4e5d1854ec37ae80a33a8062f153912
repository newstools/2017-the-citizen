As expected runners from the stables of champion trainer Sean Tarry and Mike de Kock dominate the entries for the R1-million HSH Princess Charlene Empress Club Stakes (Grade 1) over 1600m at Turffontein on Saturday 22 April. Tarry has nominated five runners including three-year-old Safe Harbour who at 106, has the highest merit rating of the 19 entries. She put up an improved performance when narrowly beaten by Orchid Island in the Grade 1 Wilgerbosdrift SA Classic over 1800m. She is likely to prefer this 1600m and having drawn at No 7 will have plenty fans if she runs. Tarry has also entered Intergalactic, Trophy Wife, Tahini and Heaps Of Fun. De Kock has nominated three runners, including Nother Russia, three-year-old Al Hawraa and The Centenary, who is likely to find this trip a touch sharp. Cape Town-based trainer Justin Snaith has entered Star Express who narrowly beaten by Nightingale in the Grade 1 Klawervlei Paddock Stakes on Sun Met Day. She has not raced since then but would be a massive contender if she runs. Fort Ember has been taking on the boys of late and performed well and Paul Peter s runner has also got the advantage of jumping from No 1 draw. Supplementary entries close at 9am on Thursday, with declarations by 11am on Tuesday 18 April Entries for the R1-million HSH Princess Charlene Empress Club Stakes (Grade 1) over 1600m at Turffontein on Saturday 22 April
