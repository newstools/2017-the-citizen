AB de Villiers sure isn&#8217;t being reassuring towards the Proteas. South Africa&#8217;s one-day skipper withdrew from Royal Challengers Bangalore&#8217;s match against Gujarat Lions in the Indian Premier League (IPL) on Tuesday afternoon. Also read: IPL thanks AB de Villiers wife for her pep talk It&#8217;s the second time in this campaign that De Villiers has been sidelined with a suspected back injury and has many wondering how ready he&#8217;ll be for the Proteas&#8217; ICC Champions Trophy assault in England. The dynamic batter missed his franchise&#8217;s first two games after feeling only &#8220;90% ready&#8221;. He returned to score 89*, 19 and 29 in his next three games. &#8220;Disappointed to be missing the match tonight for RCB, due to injury,&#8221; De Villiers wrote on Twitter. The 33-year-old was superb in the Proteas&#8217; one-day series win over New Zealand last month and, despite not playing Test cricket currently, is a vital player in the limited overs format. South Africa announce their squads for the tour to England in Illovo on Wednesday and it&#8217;s hoped De Villiers&#8217; name can be read out without any injury concern. Meanwhile, seamer Vernon Philander&#8217;s scan on a groin injury only revealed a grade one tear. He&#8217;s currently playing for English county Sussex in preparation for the tour. Normally, an injury of that kind only means 10 days&#8217; rest. For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
