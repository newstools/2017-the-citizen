EWN reporter Ziyanda Ngcobo attended the Siyabakhumbula heroes event at the University of Zululand on Saturday and tweeted what President Jacob Zuma was saying. However, the reporter was shocked to see that the ANC Twitter account had copied and pasted some of her tweets, only that they forgot to remove her initials. #Siyabakhumbula #KZNANC President Jacob Zuma at the Siyabakhumbula heroes event at the University of Zululand.ZN pic.twitter.com/DnPgDyfBx3 &mdash; Year of OR Tambo (@MYANC) April 22, 2017 &#8220;So you steal my tweets word for word and forget to remove the ZN part? OOOOOKAAAYYY,&#8221; Ngcobo tweeted the account. When she stopped tweeting from her personal account, @MYANC then went for the ones she tweeted using her work Twitter account, and this time, they didn&#8217;t have her initials. Copying and pasting exactly the same thing from @ewnreporter https://t.co/4X760FuKv2 &mdash; Ziyanda N (@ZiyandaNgcobo) April 22, 2017 Ngcobo said she was not angry about the plagiarism, but found it hilarious as they copied even her initials. Why the account did not do the easy things and just retweet her is a mystery. To make things even more hilarious, the account went on to take tweets that she had translated from isiZulu into English. @ThembiMrototo @MyAnc and I translated Zuma&#39;s speech from IsiZulu into English in the EXACT same words but of course their tweets were slightly delayed pic.twitter.com/34cVhWFiKJ &mdash; Ziyanda N (@ZiyandaNgcobo) April 23, 2017 The Twitter account has not responded to the accusations.
