Dybala scored twice in the first 22 minutes for the Italian champions and Giorgio Chiellini made it 3-0 10 minutes into the second half, leaving Barcelona shellshocked. Having overturned a 4-0 first-leg deficit against Paris Saint-Germain in the last 16 by winning the return 6-1, Barcelona will need another stunning comeback in next week&#8217;s second leg if they are to reach the last four.
