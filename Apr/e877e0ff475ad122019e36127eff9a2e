&nbsp; Whenever there is a feature race at Fairview, particularly for fillies, it attracts the trainers from the Western Cape who are hoping to pick up some Black Type for their runners. That is once again the case on Friday when the Listed East Cape Oaks over 2000m on the turf track will be run. Justin Snaith is a regular in Port Elizabeth as he keeps a satellite stable in the Eastern Cape but has brought a newbie to town in the form of Konkola. This three-year-old daughter of Silvano is only a maiden winner but she has run some decent races once Snaith started to put her over a little further. She should have no problem with the distance and Snaith has brought Bernard Fayd Herbe from Cape Town to ride her. She has not raced since December but Snaith tends to bring his runners back fit enough to win. Snaith also has Fortissimus who was narrowly beaten on debut in the province but will have come on from that run and should reverse the result with Another Night, even though they meet at the same weights. Brett Crawford has brought Baroness Mary to Fairview but the man who can stop the raiders is Alan Greeff who has five runners. Best of these looks to be Beataboutthebush who has won four of her five starts and was narrowly beaten in her fifth. She was hard ridden to win over 1600m last time and but if this daughter of Gimmethegreenlight sees out the trip she could beat off all the visiting horses. Greg Cheyne takes the ride.
