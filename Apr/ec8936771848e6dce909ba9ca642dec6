We are pleased to announce the arrival of our VW Passat 2.0 TSI R-Line DSG to our Citizen Motoring long term test fleet. We will be living with this full house family sedan for the coming months and bringing you regular updates. This is the all-new VW Passat, and everything in the car is new: its design, technologies and engines. The Passat also sets new standards with an unladen weight that has been reduced by up to 85kg and fuel economy figures that have been improved by up to 14%. At 4767mm long, the Passat is 2mm shorter than the previous model, while the wheelbase is 79mm longer at 2791mm and therefore the body overhangs significantly shorter. At the same time, the Passat is 14mm lower at 1 456mm, and 12mm wider at 1 832mm. Despite exterior dimensions that are actually marginally smaller than those of the previous Passat, interior space is improved, with more leg and head room, as well as increased luggage space, which is perfect for a big family. The Passat uses as its base the Volkswagen Group s MQB (ModularerQuerbaukasten) platform or Modular Transverse Matrix. The introduction of the MQB strategy represents a turning point in the design and production of future automobiles with transverse-mounted engines as it standardises many vehicle component parameters across brands and vehicle classes and, at the same time, offers access to new technologies. The 2.0-litre turbocharged direct injection petrol engine with 162kW of power is fitted in our range topper here. It has maximum torque of 350Nm available from 1500 to 4400rpm. It is said to accelerate to 100km/h in 6.7 seconds and reach a top speed of 246km/h. The combined fuel consumption is claimed at 6.2 litres per 100km (143g/km of CO2). And this 162kW engine runs a six-speed DSG transmission. The Passat is equipped at the front with the latest generation strut-type suspension; coil springs are integrated here with telescopic shock absorbers as a unit within the spring strut. The wheels are suspended via the spring struts and the lower wishbones with a track-stabilising scrub radius. At the rear a fourlink axle with independent wheel suspension provides a high level of comfort and agile, secure chassis handling. The suspension itself is provided by gas-filled shock absorbers with separate springs. Both front and rear stabilisers are used. The 2.0 TSI R-Line 162kW DSG retails for R532 800 and comes standard with a three-year / 120000km manufacturer warranty and five-year / 100 000km Automotion Maintenance Plan. All models have a 12 year anti-corrosion warranty and 15 000 km service intervals.
