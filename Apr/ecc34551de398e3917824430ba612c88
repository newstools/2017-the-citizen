There has been one pertinent question asked by Stormers supporters this week: Shaun who? The Capetonians surprised many on Monday when they confirmed New Zealander Shaun Treeby, a 28-year-old former Highlanders centre, had joined them on a four-month contract. Injuries to three of the Stormers&#8217; international centres &#8211; Damian de Allende, Juan de Jongh and Huw Jones (Scotland) &#8211; had forced their hand. Also read: The Stormers storm their way into our Super Rugby XV for the week Gert Smal, the union&#8217;s director of rugby, had previously stated the side wanted an experienced part-timer. Yet it was widely expected that the Stormers&#8217; would&#8217;ve poached a local player. That search proved fruitless. &#8220;We did look within South Africa and even within our own provincial border but the type of experience we needed wasn&#8217;t there,&#8221; Robbie Fleck, the Stormers coach, insisted on Tuesday. &#8220;We lost a lot of experience when that trio got injured. Shaun is exactly what we&#8217;re looking for. He&#8217;s experienced at Super Rugby level, having played 50 times for the Highlanders.&#8221; Strictly speaking the Stormers did actually have a South African candidate in mind after they approached JJ Engelbrecht. But the former Springbok centre&#8217;s career has fizzled out badly in the past few years. &#8220;We looked at him,&#8221; said Fleck. &#8220;And decided not to pursue him further for various reasons.&#8221; However, there need not be a worry that the previously unemployed Treeby&#8217;s recruitment will block the development of the Stormers&#8217; promising young centres. The pairing of 21-year-old EW Viljoen and 22-year-old Dan du Plessis have already shown themselves to be capable of handling the challenge of Super Rugby. As a result, Treeby will have to be satisfied with a mentorship role. &#8220;There are only three fit centres in our group and they only boast a handful of caps,&#8221; said Fleck. &#8220;We want him to provide leadership to the rookies. The thinking is also that if we were to get another centre injured, we would need to bring in a replacement immediately.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
