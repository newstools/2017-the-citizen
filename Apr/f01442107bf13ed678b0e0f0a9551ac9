Controversial pastor Paseka &#8216;Mboro&#8217; Motsoeneng of Incredible Happenings on Wednesday visited the family of the five-year-old boy who was allegedly stabbed by a man who sucked blood from his wound. The pastor, accompanied by actors Lucky Legodi, Jerry Phele and musician Winnie Khumalo, visited the boy&#8217;s home in Orlando East, Soweto, to pray for the family, which is reportedly not coping after the death of their son. Rosina Mosiuoa, the boy&#8217;s mother, told the Sowetan that she had been struggling to sleep since the incident, saying everytime she she closed her eyes, she would see her son. Mosiuoa further said she had not forgiven the man who killed her son, and wanted him to feel the same pain she was feeling. After the prayers, Pastor Mboro reportedly gave the family several R100 notes. They have reportedly not received any counselling since their son&#8217;s killing. He further said he would also visit the alleged killer and pray for him too, as &#8220;satanism exists&#8221;. Tinyiko Mongwe was killed in Orlando East last week after the 21-year-old man allegedly attacked him while he was playing on the streets with his friends.
