Cassper is no stranger to snagging top international artists for features, he has worked with rappers The Game and Talip Kweli on his previous albums. Now as exciting as him collaborating with Drake for his next album is, it&#8217;s not happening just yet because Drake hasn&#8217;t met Cassper or even spoken to him. After a pic of Drake and a man who looked similar to Cassper started circulating on Twitter, some started speculating that the two had hung out and had even made music together. Cassper quickly shut that down though responding to a fan that it wasn&#8217;t him in the image and he wouldn&#8217;t have any surprise features on his new album, Thuto. Surprise surprise, Drake is on that new Cassper Nyovest album #Thuto pic.twitter.com/1jWVt9DLoe &mdash; Issa Graduate (@SNEH_W) April 21, 2017 Lmao&#8230; That&#39;s not me in the picture. Drake is not on the album. I haven&#39;t even spoke to him in my life. No surprise features. Just music https://t.co/kmKW7l8mdY &mdash; Abuti Fill Up (@CassperNyovest) April 21, 2017 Cassper has already started creating hype for his album, tweeting that people should brace themselves for publicity stunts in anticipation of his next offering. I just wanna drop this #Thuto album now. Honestly over this waiting. I also can&#39;t wait 2 see all the publicity stunts people have planned. &mdash; Abuti Fill Up (@CassperNyovest) April 21, 2017 Trust me&#8230; This is my best album!!! https://t.co/TAtgqUZrVm &mdash; Abuti Fill Up (@CassperNyovest) April 21, 2017 ALSO READ: Rebecca Malope, Friends Like These had us all fooled For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
