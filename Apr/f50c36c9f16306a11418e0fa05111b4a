A senior ANC member has reportedly called for an urgent meeting of the party s national executive committee (NEC), prompted by the continued calls by society at large for President Jacob Zuma to resign. NEC member Mathole Motshekga, an NEC member and former parliamentary chief whip of the ANC, said the clamour against Zuma was harming the country and the ruling party. He reportedly told Bloomberg by phone that he wrote to ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe requesting the meeting. There is unrest in the country, and it is affecting civil and business life, so it is important that the matters that have been placed on the agenda be attended to quickly so that society can return to normalcy and people must go on with their work, Bloomberg quoted him as saying. The country&#8217;s sovereign credit ratings have been downgraded to junk by both Standard and Poor&#8217;s Global and Fitch Ratings in the wake of a cabinet reshuffle that saw the then finance minister and his deputy axed.
