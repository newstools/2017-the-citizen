Springbok Sevens coach Neil Powell is quietly confident that his Blitzboks team can continue their good form in the World Rugby Sevens Series at this weekend s Hong Kong Sevens. The South Africans have contested all six finals played so far in the series and will be chasing their first title in Hong Kong when the tournament starts on Friday morning. Their only game on day one is against France at 14:40 (SA time). Powell feels that the intensity at training pointed to his team being switched on for the task at hand. &#8220;I&#8217;m happy with our preparation, with all 13 players on the field working hard,&#8221; said Powell. We had to nurse some of the guys back to fitness in Stellenbosch, in order to get them here. But there was no sign of slacking on the field, so I am pleased with the intensity, as that is always a good sign.&#8221; Powell has selected four players who have not experienced the cauldron of the Hong Kong National Stadium before. Selvyn Davids will make his debut here, Stedman Gans and Zain Davids are fairly new to the series and Dylan Sage did not travel to Hong Kong last year. &#8220;The youngsters are improving all the time. They will make mistakes, but that is part of the growth of any player,&#8221; Powell said. I am pleased how they progressed, they now need some playing team on the field. We have a balanced side, with a number of stalwarts and some exciting talent coming off the bench, so we are hoping to again give a good account of ourselves. The coach admitted that their Hong Kong track record was not good, compared to teams such as Fiji, New Zealand and Samoa. &#8220;Fiji and New Zealand tend to lift themselves when playing here, so we will have to be at our very best if we want to compete,&#8221; said Powell. He was also very proud of stalwart Cecil Afrika, who will be running out in his 50th tournament. &#8220;Cecil understands this game. He is a strong leader and few players deserve this more than Cecil. Maybe we can also reward him with a tournament win, like we did with Branco du Preez in Las Vegas,&#8221; the coach said. Afrika himself said he will enjoy the moment: &#8220;I can still recall that first touch, coming off the bench. I had to throw into the line-out, something that was not a strong suit of mine. My hands were pretty sweaty. I also fondly remembers my first try a week later in George. It was against France. I also managed two more for my first hat-trick.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter. &nbsp; &nbsp;
