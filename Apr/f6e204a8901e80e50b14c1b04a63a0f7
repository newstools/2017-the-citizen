A Port Elizabeth man, accused of stabbing his estranged wife several times, was back in the city s magistrates court on Wednesday, where the case against him was once again postponed. Forty-seven-year old Martin Stevens, from Algoa Park, is facing a charge of attempted murder after he allegedly stabbed his estranged wife, Anna-Marie, outside her friend s flat in Sydenham in October 2015. He handed himself over to police after being on the run for four days after the attack. Subsequent to his arrest, the case was postponed several times and Stevens eventually underwent observation at Fort England Psychiatric Hospital. Stevens, who is out on bail, is being represented by well-known defence attorney Alwyn Griebenow. Last month, the case against him was postponed for a provisional trial date to be set. However, it emerged in court on Wednesday that the State was awaiting for certain information from Fort England Psychiatric Hospital following Stevens stay there. The case was postponed to May 16. Fifteen years ago Stevens reportedly killed his ex-wife Hettie and her friend Colin Rosslee before attempting to kill himself by turning the gun on himself. Stevens was acquitted of the double murder after the court found he had suffered a psychotic episode.
