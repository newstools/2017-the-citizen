Four-time major-winner Ernie Els turned back the clock with a level-par 72 in the opening round of the Masters at Augusta on Thursday night. The &#8220;Big Easy&#8221; finds himself tied for 12th, seven-shots behind American Charley Hoffman who was a class apart in round one with a seven-under 65 to lead by four in biting cold and windy conditions.

The 47-year-old leads the way among the South Africans in the field, with Charl Schwartzel compiling a two-over 74 for 26th place, Branden Grace settling for 76 and a share of 54th, Louis Oosthuizen in 66th after a 77 and Trevor Immelman near the back of the field in 86th after shooting a 79. The former world number one has seen his world ranking slip to 410th, and could well be playing in his last Masters off the five-year exemption he received for winning the 2012 Open Championship. There is hope for Els, however, as the top-12 players and ties receive an invite to the tournament the following year. Maintaining his place near the top of the leaderboard, though, could prove difficult with the quality field that&#8217;s present. &#8220;Obviously I ll take a 72 in these conditions,&#8221; said Els. &#8220;And after what happened last year, it was quite different. I was hoping for an easier day. I played good golf on the back nine and you ve got to keep doing what you are doing. &#8220;We are going to be absolutely exhausted by the end of the week if this weather keeps up. This is some of the toughest conditions I ve ever played in. We ll see how it goes.&#8221; With windy and rainy conditions dominating the buildup and much of day one, the experience of Els in difficult weather came in handy. &#8220;I wouldn t say I m a links specialist, but I like to play linksy golf. &#8220;You had to play some of those shots. The greens were quite receptive because of the rain, so you can play a low shot in there. Normally Augusta National doesn t receive that low shot; today it did. And I just kept doing that.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
