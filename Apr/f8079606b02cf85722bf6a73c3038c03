Earthlife activists were jubilant outside the Western Cape High Court after it found government s nuclear procurement processes to be unlawful and unconstitutional. Judge Lee Bozalek delivered judgement on Wednesday to a packed courtroom. The case was brought by Earthlife Africa and the Southern African Faith Communities Environment Institute against government in 2015. The applicants argued that government could not afford the one trillion rand it would cost to go ahead with the nuclear deal. Activists at court described it as a victory for South Africans after government s agreements with Russia, the United States and South Korea were set aside by the court.
