A man was murdered and two people assaulted during a farm attack on Friday night at Moseley Farm on the R40 outside Barberton in Mpumalanga.

When the Barberton Times visited the victims home on Saturday morning, the woman had bruises on her face. She said three armed men entered the house and two followed them later. &#8220;My husband was upstairs and we were downstairs when they arrived. &#8220;The suspects tied our hands and legs using speaker wire they found in our house. &#8220;They assaulted me, demanding to know where we keep the safe in the house. &#8220;During this torment, some went upstairs and stabbed my husband to death. They took the jewellery I was wearing before leaving our property. After they left, I screamed for help,&#8221; she said.
