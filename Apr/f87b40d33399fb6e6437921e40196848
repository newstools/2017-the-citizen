Social grants payments were under way across the country for beneficiaries who received their grants through ATMs and merchants. At 10am, 2.6 million beneficiaries had already accessed their grants, the department said in a statement. Beneficiaries were encouraged to contact the SA Social Security Agency (Sassa) call centre for any enquires on 0800-60-10-11. So far, over 1500 queries had already been handled. Government wishes to remind beneficiaries who receive their grants at pay points that they will receive their grants as normal from Monday, 3 April 2017.
