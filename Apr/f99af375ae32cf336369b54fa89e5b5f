I have a question that I would like to get a clear and succinct answer on; what s up with men and cheating? Is it something that is bequeathed to them at creation?I always thought womanising was an African man s syndrome but now I am convinced that it is every man s diseases.Even those who pretend to be faithful secretly hunker for adultery and would jump at the opportunity.Well it is only now that I know that the mchepuko virus is here to stay and with time it is only getting complicated, men and women are coming up with new ways to make it work.Just imagine your husband or wife waking up as early as 5am with the excuse of beating the mad traffic jams.To any understanding spouse it is quite a relevant excuse given what people have to go through in the crazy Dar traffic.But well you could be wrong as well because she is not heading to work straight she is stopping somewhere for a romp with her mchepuko before heading to the office! How about that?Now this new one beats all any of those tracking systems that we keep making noise about!The other day, I stumbled on an interesting piece that gave a list of animals that have an opportunity of having only one partner for life and till death do they part.If animals can afford to be faithful, why has man with an advanced brain failed stick to a single partner even as religion stresses the importance of fidelity?Even with dangers associated with adultery men and women just won t take heedTechnology has taken it to another level and made it easier.If you look at all the guys who cheated, it was either that it started from that exchange of mobile numbers, Facebook accounts and many other ways.Men cheat with the full knowledge of what is at stake, but still do it with some low lives that end up leaking the intimate details of their liaison to the press.Since they control the mobile phones and email, they assume they can clear their traces beyond reasonable doubt.Not in this era! Just a reminder you can never clear all your traces on those gadgets.I heard this interesting story of a woman who was curious about a certain Juma who was always sending texts to her husband and calling on regular basis at night.Whenever she asked her husband who it was, he would say that Juma was a childhood friend who had just returned from abroad and they were just catching up on their days as boys playing in the fields.Her seventh sense nagged her to find out more just to dispel her fears. When she called the receiver was a woman. Juma was the woman she had been sharing her husband with for several months.Another friend at the office has fears about the kind of name on her boyfriend s phone. He has names like Garage, Barbers, Rav4 and chips- kuku who texts all the time.Men consider this a public notice. The very gadget you use to cheat on your spouse is the same that will bring you down.A man whose inbox and sent items is always empty is a man who has something to hide; a man whose call log is always empty despite receiving and making calls is suspect.As the world gets smaller, cheating gets easier so are the ways of catching a cheat.So make your choice, to cheat or not to cheat.
