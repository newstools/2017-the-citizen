It s high fashion and high stakes. By now dresses have been picked out, suits tailored and top hats waiting patiently for their wearers. There s an air of anticipation as Turffontein Racecourse prepares to welcome Her Serene Highness Princess Charlene of Monaco to the city track on Saturday. It s a day that sees the Benoni-born royal lend her support to the Sport of Kings with the main aim to raise funds for a number of causes, chief among them the Highveld Horse Care Unit, the Gugu Lesizwe school and the Red Cross. Funds for these initiatives will be raised from the Diamond Drop which will see a helicopter swoop over the venue and drop a marker. The winner will be the ticket holder of the relevant block in which the diamond lands with a prize, sponsored by Petra Diamonds, worth R150 000, up for grabs. The entry fees for the lucrative HSH Princess Charlene of Monaco Maiden Plates have also been added to the amount for the various charities. The highlight of the day will be the running of the HSH Princess Charlene of Monaco Empress Club Stakes, a Group One race that sees a maximum field of 16 fillies and mares battle it out in a R1-million spectacle and in a bid to emulate the feats of a former champion. Empress Club is regarded as one of South African horseracing s legendary performers with six Group One wins to her name among 17 career victories spanning between 1991 and 1993 including an impressive win in the Met. For racegoers there is also the opportunity to stand a chance to walk away with one of four R10 000 cash prizes as part of a Best Dressed competition on the day. In order to qualify as one of the Best Dressed couples, ladies need to be wearing a fascinator or hat and gents must be in top hat and tails or black tie with a hat. Tickets for the HSH Princess Charlene of Monaco Ladies Day are available at Webtickets (https://goo.gl/Nid30l) or at the gate on the day.
