For a minority devastated by a series of church bombings that killed dozens of Christians, it was a chance for a rare joyous respite. It was, said Coptic Catholic engineer Maged Francis, a &#8220;historic occasion&#8221;. &#8220;It&#8217;s unlikely it will ever happen again,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Today joy has eclipsed the sadness of the last few weeks.&#8221; Outside, armed security personnel stood guard and checked vehicles bringing in the pilgrims, while helicopters flew overhead. Inside a choir sang &#8220;Hallelujah, Hallelujah&#8221; as the smiling pontiff entered and circled on a golf cart, waving to the crowds who released yellow and white balloons, the colours of the Vatican flag. The faithful filled up the stadium&#8217;s terraces and chairs neatly lined up in front of a main stage sheltered by a large white canopy where the pope led a mass of peace. Well-wishers waved flags as the pontiff advanced slowly along a red carpet adorned with yellow and white flowers. The pope &#8212; flanked by bodyguards who scanned the crowd from behind their black sunglasses &#8212; bent down smiling to greet children wearing the gilded headgear of ancient Egypt&#8217;s pharaohs. -&#8216;Difficult moments&#8217;- Hymns in Italian, Arabic and French resounded across the playing field, as the pontiff bowed before a portrait of the Holy Family escaping to Egypt, and kissed the altar on the main stage. &#8220;Peace be with you,&#8221; the spiritual leader of the world&#8217;s 1.3 billion Catholics said in Arabic as he started his homily. &#8220;True faith&#8230; makes us see the other not as an enemy to be overcome, but a brother or sister to be loved, served and helped,&#8221; he then told the crowds in Italian. &#8220;True faith leads us to protect the rights of others with the same zeal and enthusiasm with which we defend our own,&#8221; he said in the speech translated into Arabic. In the audience, Nabil Shukri followed the pontiff&#8217;s words on a service leaflet in Arabic. &#8220;It&#8217;s very important that he&#8217;s here. We are not scared of going to church in Egypt,&#8221; he said, holding a Vatican flag. Nagwa Kamal, a maths teacher at a Coptic Catholic school in Cairo, said she was delighted to be in the Argentine pontiff&#8217;s presence. &#8220;We love him so much. We feel he loves peace,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We have lived through difficult moments but we have overcome them,&#8221; she said, apparently referring to Coptic church bombings in December and April claimed by the Islamic State group that killed dozens of worshippers. &#8220;Terrorism will not win. It&#8217;s peace that counts.&#8221; IS has threatened more attacks against Egypt&#8217;s Christians, who make up around 10 percent of the country&#8217;s population of 92 million. Egypt&#8217;s Catholic community is estimated at about 272,000, with much of the rest following the Coptic Orthodox Church. Manal George, who had come from a Cairo middle-class neighbourhood with her nephew to attend the mass, said the pope&#8217;s visit brought much-needed cheer to Egypt&#8217;s Christians. &#8220;By coming to Egypt, the pope has taken away the sadness to replace it with joy,&#8221; she said.
