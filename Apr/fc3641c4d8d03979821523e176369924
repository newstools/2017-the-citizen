Small Business Development Minister Lindiwe Zulu has strongly condemned acts of violence and destruction of property that took place in the early hours of Saturday morning and resulted in the death of an Ethiopian businessman in Nokhala village, Kwelera, outside East London. In a strongly worded statement, Zulu reiterated that all forms of violence against small businesses, small business-owners and their employees are strongly condemned by government, the police and society in general. Informed by the principled stance and efforts of the government of South Africa, I reiterate that all forms of violence against small businesses, small business-owners and their employees are acts of violence against the fabric, values and integrity of our democratic society and collective endeavours to build an inclusive and sustainable economy, she said. She said the criminal acts that were carried out pursuant of the death of the Ethiopian national businessman, and the destruction of the property he operated in, only served to undermine government s gains and ongoing efforts that are targeted at nurturing an entrepreneurial society. We are confident that our law-enforcement agencies will timeously deploy the necessary resources towards effecting justice. Meanwhile, we urge these agencies to continue asserting the rule of law, calm and stability in Nokhala Village, said Zulu. -African News Agency For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
