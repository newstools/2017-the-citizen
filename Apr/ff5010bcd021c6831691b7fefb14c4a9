The South African Music Awards (Samas) have announced that rapper Nasty C&#8217;s two music videos for Good Girls and Don t Do It have been removed from the nomination list. This after the organisers received several inquiries about the qualification of the rapper&#8217;s music videos and lauched an investigation. According to the Samas rules, a video should be submitted for nomination only if it was aired on TV before the closing date of January 31. However, the organisers&#8217; investigation revealed that the videos were submitted for entry on 24 January 2017 and were aired on TV after the deadline. In light of this, the two music videos are automatically disqualified because they do not meet the criteria for Best Music Video Category. &mdash; The SA Music Awards (@TheSAMAs) April 26, 2017 &#8220;We have determined that the videos were not flighted before the closing date of the entries of 31 January 2017 as required by the SAMA rules. &#8220;We have always trusted that music videos submitted for this category have been flighted by broadcasters during the specific entry period. &#8220;This case has proven us wrong and we accept full responsibility for our oversight to further verify whether the music videos were flighted,&#8221; said the Sama office. The office said they would announce replacement nominees soon. The videos were nominated in the Best Music Video category. Nasty C&#8217;s nominations are now down to five, making Kwesta the most nominated artist.
