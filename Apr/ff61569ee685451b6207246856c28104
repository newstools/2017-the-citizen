A presumed US drone strike on Sunday killed three suspected members of Al-Qaeda in south Yemen, a local official said. Speaking on condition of anonymity, the official said the suspects&#8217; vehicle had been targeted and its three occupants were incinerated in the strike. The attack took place in the Al-Said area of Shabwa province. Washington has sharply intensified its air war against the jihadists since President Donald Trump took office in January. The Pentagon said on April 3 that it had carried out more than 70 strikes against jihadist targets in Yemen since February 28. Before Sunday&#8217;s attack, two strikes overnight on Tuesday killed five suspected members of Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula that the US regards to be the most dangerous branch of the extremist group. Last month, US media reports said Trump&#8217;s administration had given new powers to the CIA to conduct drone strikes against extremist targets in the Middle East.
