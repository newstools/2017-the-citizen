There&#8217;s a reason why there wasn&#8217;t much of a reaction when 22-year-old Aiden Markram was named South Africa A&#8217;s four-day captain. And it&#8217;s quite an obvious one: it&#8217;s happened before. Also read: Russell Domingo: I d still rather want Kagiso Rabada back in SA 14 years ago, the Proteas selectors controversially decided to install a rookie named Graeme Smith as skipper. He became South Africa&#8217;s most successful captain ever. Markram also has no captaincy experience at senior level though he was the World Cup-winning captain of the 2014 national U-19 side. That group also featured a certain Kagiso Rabada. Instead, the national selectors are banking on Markram&#8217;s &#8220;captaincy potential&#8221;, much like Smith. &#8220;Aiden has done very well in franchise cricket,&#8221; said selection convener Linda Zondi. &#8220;To be honest, it has already give us enough confidence to make him captain. Granted, he has no senior experience but we know him from his U-19 days. This really isn&#8217;t a decision we&#8217;re shy to make.&#8221; Even if the captaincy decision was a surprising one, Markram&#8217;s selection purely as a player was inevitable. South African cricket has been crying out for a specialist opener of his potential. After scoring 565 runs at an average of 51 in the domestic four-day competition, the Titans star blew some minds in the One-day Cup. He first smashed 183 off 138 balls against the Highveld Lions &#8211; the highest individual score in domestic one-day cricket. The Markram proved it was no fluke in the final, where he hammered 161 off 123. Uncannily, the man from Centurion also took 8 wickets with his more than useful off-spinners. Who was another skilled tweaker in his younger days? You guessed it, Graeme Smith. The only real burning question left then is whether the A-tour to England is an &#8220;audition&#8221; for Markram to get into the Proteas setup? Zondi was a bit more vague on that issue. &#8220;Every player that&#8217;s been picked in the SA A-side is good enough to play for the Proteas if they grab an opportunity,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Given that the A-side are also playing in England against strong opponents, you can say with quite some confidence this is a trial for them to stake a claim for higher honours.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
