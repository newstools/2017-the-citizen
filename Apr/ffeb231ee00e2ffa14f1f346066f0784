A security guard and a passerby were killed in a shooting incident in Soweto on Saturday morning, while six other people, including two taxi owners, were injured. In an interview with eNCA earlier on Saturday, Gauteng police spokesperson Captain Kay Makhubela said police could not rule out the possibility that the incident may be linked to taxi violence, as during the week, four taxi bosses were killed in a similar shooting incident. Makhubela pointed to disputes over taxi routes as a possible reason for the violent flare-ups. Makhubela further told eNCA that a case of murder and attempted murder had been opened following Saturday&#8217;s shooting incident in which unknown men started shooting at people at the taxi rank in Crossroads, Soweto. Police are now reportedly appealing to the public to come forward with any information that could lead to the suspects&#8217; arrests.
