No, no, it wasn t me, it was them. Star flank Siya Kolisi quickly pointed to his Springbok teammates after last weekend s 41-23 win in the Rugby Championship against Argentina in Salta. For a second time in five Tests this year Kolisi was named Man-of-the-Match after also receiving the accolade following the second French Test in Durban, won 37-15 by the Boks.

It s all about the team, said Kolisi. So we are enjoying what we do and we hope the people are enjoying it with us as we are trying to get better and better with every game. The 26-year-old Bok flanker, who has now scored four times in 21 Tests, simply raved about the almost miraculous turnaround this year after the turmoil of last season. I really enjoy playing with these guys as we have started our own brand and our own culture, he said. And you are allowed to be who you are, just bring your best for the team who always come first. While the Boks are currently unbeaten after five Tests and having scored their first away win in two seasons, Kolisi said they know tough times lie ahead with the Wallabies and the All Blacks awaiting them. For us to win there in Salta was quite special as we struggled over there the past couple of years, he said. We knew we had to fight fire with fire, so we knew at the weekend it was going to be all about guts. And what better way to do it than in our new red jersey, celebrating unity. It was an immensely proud occasion to be part of and I really enjoyed it. Kolisi said they will rest for a few days before leaving for Perth this weekend for the Wallaby Test next weekend. We know tough times will come, but as a team we are looking forward to going on this journey together, he said.
