Set in the 1990s on a hot California night, &#8220;Meteor Shower&#8221; will star Schumer as one half of the two couples who dine together and end up watching a cosmic shower of smoldering rocks. &#8220;I am more thrilled than thrilled about this announcement,&#8221; Martin tweeted of the production. &#8220;An impeccable cast.&#8221; The Hollywood actor, writer and producer told The New York Times he recruited 36-year-old Schumer by approaching her at a party at her house and asking her to read the script. Schumer praised the play on twitter as &#8220;hilarious&#8221; as she confirmed that she was joining the Broadway lineup. While reviews of earlier productions have been mixed, her star power is likely to drive ticket sales ahead of curtain&#8217;s up. The actress can currently be seen on the silver screen in action-comedy &#8220;Snatched&#8221; alongside Goldie Hawn as a mother-daughter duo who go on a holiday-from-hell adventure. The play&#8217;s director will be Jerry Zaks, whose glitzy revival of &#8220;Hello, Dolly!&#8221; won four Tony awards, including best actress in a musical for legendary star Bette Midler. &#8220;Meteor Shower&#8221; will run for 12 weeks at New York&#8217;s Booth Theatre. Previews begin November 1 with official opening night on November 29. Starring alongside Schumer will be Alan Tudyk, Laura Benanti and Keegan-Michael Key.
