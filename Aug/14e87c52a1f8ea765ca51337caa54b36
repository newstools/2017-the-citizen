In a development that will divide opinion, AB de Villiers has decided to play Test cricket again. The Proteas&#8217; middle-order dynamo announced his decision on Wednesday afternoon after widespread speculation that he&#8217;d actually ditch the longest form of the game. &#8220;I really do feel refreshed and revived,&#8221; said De Villiers. &#8220;I want to get back on the field and I have assured the national selectors that I will be available for selection in all three formats of the game during the coming season.&#8221; He had communicated in January that he was taking an indefinite break from Tests. However, there is a caveat. In order to play Tests, the 33-year-old has quit the one-day captaincy. &#8220;Faf du Plessis has proved to be an outstanding captain of the T20 and Test teams, and bearing this in mind, I have informed Cricket South Africa that I would like to step down as captain of the ODI team,&#8221; said De Villiers. &#8220;It has been an honour to lead the team for the past six years, but it is now time for someone else to take the ODI side forward. Whoever is chosen as the new ODI captain will have my complete support.&#8221; De Villiers won&#8217;t play in the Test series against Bangladesh at the end of next month but is available from mid-October for all international matches. His decision will go a long way towards silencing some critics, who believe he put his own interests ahead of the national side. &#8220;People to said I&#8217;m picking and choosing when to play for the Proteas, and even to suggest I am somehow putting myself before the team. That is simply not true. That has never been true. Playing for South Africa is, and will always be, the greatest privilege of my life,&#8221; De Villiers said.
