Prophetess Mary Bushiri, prophet Shepherd Bushiri&#8217;s wife, celebrated her birthday on Wednesday, and her husband had nothing but good things to say about her. He wrote a lengthy message on Facebook, praising her as nothing but the best. &#8220;Through the years, you have given me the gift of your heart. But on your birthday, please know you have my heart and all that I can possibly give. You do so much to take care of the kids, the church, our family and me. And because you are so good at what you do, sometimes I tend to forget the hard work you put, to make sure that our lives are as great as they are. &#8220;On this birthday, I hope I can show you how much you mean to me and how grateful I am that you are my wife. Not only have you given me a beautiful family, you&#8217;ve made your heart a beautiful home I can always run to,&#8221; he said. He threw a birthday dinner for her with close friends, and later surprised her with a Mercedes-Benz G-Class, worth about R2 million. The first lady of Enlightened Christian Gathering could not help but look at her husband in adoration.
