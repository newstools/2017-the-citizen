Kessel Ferrari driver David Perel from South Africa will head to Budapest in Hungary this weekend, to compete in the fourth round of the Blancpain Sports Car Sprint Championship. Perel, who leads all three Sprint, Endurance and Overall AM Class championships in the series, stands to wrap up the Sprint title at the Hungaroring. This is a track he is familiar with following his first Blancpain win at the Formula 1 circuit in 2016. The Hungaroring is such an awesome track to drive, David said. Last year was my first time there and I took to it immediately. I enjoyed every lap so I can not wait to get back there. It s also a pretty big weekend for my co-driver Stephen Earle and me because all we need to do is finish both races to be crowned the 2017 Sprint Champions. The first race will get underway on Saturday and the main race on Sunday.
