The South African cricket team have just a few days to find a way of salvaging their dismal tour to England. Having already lost the one-day international and T20 international series to England, and being dumped out of the Champions Trophy in the first round after winning just a solitary match, the tour to England hasn t been a good one. Monday s 239-run loss in the third Test at The Oval means the Proteas cannot win the four-match Test series. However, if they win the fourth and final Test at Old Trafford in Manchester, starting on Friday, they can still secure a series draw. A 2-2 draw would be an excellent result for the Proteas, who were comprehensively beaten in the first and third Tests, but put in arguably their best performance on tour when they won by 340 runs at Trent Bridge. Exactly how Faf du Plessis men will find a way to turn their fortunes around is anyone s guess because the Proteas have failed to find consistency on a tour that started on May 19. There have been very few moments of brilliance from the team, but when that has occurred it has been isolated and brief. The Proteas will have to dig deep, make tough changes and find a way to play as a unit if they are to bring anything home from their trip.
