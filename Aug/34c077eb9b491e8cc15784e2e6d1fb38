The Springboks&#8217; red jersey for Saturday&#8217;s Rugby Championship battle against Argentina in Salta might&#8217;ve caused a stir among the general public but not the team itself. In fact, Jaco Kriel insists the players aren&#8217;t bothered in the slightest. Also read: Jake White clearly hates the Springboks special red jersey &#8220;I haven t seen the red jerseys yet, I have only seen them on social media,&#8221; said the energetic Lions flanker. The South African Rugby Union (Saru) controversially unveiled the special kit a few weeks back, explaining that it will be used to commemorate 25 years of unity in the country.

But Kriel believes it doesn&#8217;t matter what type of kit a player appears in. Representing your country is all that matters. &#8220;We are all proud to represent our country and it doesn t matter what colour the jersey is.We will be proud to wear it if that is the colour that signifies us as a team representing our country on the day,&#8221; said Kriel. For good measure, he tried to give the general public a glimpse of what that truly means. &#8220;It is such an honour to play for our country, and we feel so blessed. Only a small number of people get to feel the pride of representing the whole nation. As small boys we all wanted to play for our country, to represent the whole nation. We grew up wanting that. That&#8217;s what is important to us.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
