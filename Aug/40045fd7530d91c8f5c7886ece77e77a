Dar es Salaam. There were days when Diamond and AliKiba who are believed to Tanzania s top artistes made the world believe that all was well between them, but that seems to be in quite a distant past.This week the release of Fresh remix by rapper Fid Q brought to the surface the ugly nature of their cold war pitting Diamond against AliKiba and Ommy Dimpoz.In the remix in what seems to be a dig at AliKiba s long silence, Diamond raps saying they once asked to be given the throne but now I have given them a bed to sleep as well .AliKiba in his response referred to Diamond as the Queen who has laid his bed, a response that seemed to attract negative comments and positive in equal measures.But that was not until Ommy Dimpoz joined the fray posting a picture with Diamond s mother saying Diamond is his son.The post received an instant reaction with people like Steve Nyerere and Mubenga warning the singer not to go that direction because it was disrespectful to all mothers. Isn t you who sang that there is no one like a mother, wrote Mubenga Dimpoz s former manager.To date it is not clear what really happened between these three singers that have brought them to the brink of war.Sources say it started with Diamond s elimination of Kiba s vocals on one of the songs he had they had done together whereas there are those who claim that it started after Single Boy.It is also reported that the hostility was further entrenched when AliKiba started dating Diamond s former flame Jokate Mwegelo, something that many believe Diamond was not pleased with at all. Whatever happened to them remains a mystery but it is quite clear that they have made the social media such a noisy place for now.
