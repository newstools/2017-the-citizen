Ndebele artist Esther Mahlangu&#8217;s work is being celebrated in the latest issue of Destiny magazine. Mahlangu has recently collaborated with BMW in a lucrative deal in which her artwork is used in the &#8216;art car&#8217; luxury 7 series model. Mahlangu has also worked with an alcohol brand and her work has been honoured internationally. According to South Africa.net, Esther Mahlangu has exhibited locally and abroad in Australia, America, Japan and in many European countries, and was also awarded the Order of Ikhamanga in Silver by the South African presidency for her contribution to the development of indigenous Ndebele arts. Khanyi Dhlomo, publisher of Destiny magazine, posted on Instagram that Mahlangu&#8217;s legacy needed to be honoured. &#8220;Africa you are Beautiful. Africa you are Powerful. Africa you are the Cradle of Humankind. Africa you are the Now. Africa you are the Future. Believe it. Embrace it. Celebrate it.
