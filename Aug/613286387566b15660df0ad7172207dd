Cassper Nyovest recently shared a video of his father, Letsebela Phoolo, dancing at a house party, and it is pretty cute. According to the description on the video, Phoolo was getting down at their housewarming party and dancing to old school kwaito as the crowd cheers him on. He does get tired, though, in the middle and opts to take a breather, but then gets right back to it. The old man definitely dances a lot better than some of us. Now we know where Cassper got his moves from. &#8220;Oh snap, I thought you had moves until I saw this video. Big up to your pops, he knows how to burn the dance floor. Good looking out for your dad, its inspiring to see the young remember those that stuck around through thick and thin,&#8221; commented one of his followers, while another wrote: &#8220;Exactly how a father should be a friend, a protector and someone who makes his children laugh and smile. This is beautiful. A true superman indeed! You are blessed!&#8221; Watch the video below: Also read: Meet Cassper Nyovest&#8217;s father no, it&#8217;s not Penny Penny
