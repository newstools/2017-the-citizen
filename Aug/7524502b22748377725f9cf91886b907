From November 2017 onwards, the CFRP driveshaft in the BMW M3 Sedan, BMW M4 Coupe and BMW M4 Convertible high-performance sports cars will be gradually replaced by an M specific high-performance driveshaft made of steel. This measure will create the necessary technical basis for meeting future statutory emissions requirements. At a later point in time, a petrol particulate filter (PPF) will be incorporated into the existing installation space in these models in major markets. The newly developed steel driveshaft has been designed to ensure the superlative performance and handling qualities of the BMW M3/M4 high-performance sports cars remain unaffected. For production-related reasons, this pre-enabling needs to be carried out universally for the BMW M3 Sedan, BMW M4 Coupe and BMW M4 Convertible. This measure does not apply to the BMW M4 CS and BMW M4 GTS special-edition models. Now in their fifth generation, the BMW M3 Sedan, BMW M4 Coupe and BMW M4 Convertible represent the epitome of the high-performance sports car that can be used without compromise every day. Customer deliveries of the successful current generation of models have now topped 68 000.
