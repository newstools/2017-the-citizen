A 28-year-old suspect arrested for possession of abalone worth R900 000 in Hawston on the Cape south coast was due to appear in the Hermanus Magistrates Court on Tuesday. Police spokesperson Captain FC Van Wyk said police efforts to tackle the lucrative illegal abalone trade in the Western Cape paid off on Sunday afternoon when police and the Department of Agriculture, Forest and Fisheries were busy with a crime intelligence-driven operation in Marine Drive, Hawston. On arrival in Marine Drive, the members spotted the white Toyota Hilux LDV with Reg CA 654 720, standing in the bushes. As the members got closer to the vehicle, they noticed a man busy offloading bags from the vehicle. When the man saw the marked police vehicles he tried to run away but officials were able to apprehend him. Upon inspecting the bags, the members found that they were filled with abalone. Fourteen bags were found on the scene with a combined weight of 500kg and an estimated street value of R900 000. An 8-metre rubber duck boat with diving gear was also found standing at the back of the LDV. All the exhibits, excluding the LDV, was handed over to members from the Department of Agriculture, Forest and Fisheries. The suspect was arrested for being in possession of abalone.
