Local taxpayers who may have stashed their assets in cash and property offshore have a month to disclose their earnings and ownership details to the South African Revenue Services (Sars). The deadline for the Special Voluntary Disclosure Programme (SVDP) is August 31, 2017. &#8220;SVDP is a window period for individuals and companies to regularise undisclosed or unauthorised foreign assets and associated income. It came into effect on 01 October 2016,&#8221; Sars said in a media statement. Common Reporting Standard (CRS), a new global entity that authorises the automatic exchange of information between tax authorities, will enable Sars to start receiving offshore third-party financial data from other tax authorities on a regular basis from September 2017.

This disclosure will assist us to ascertain how much they have so we know how to tax them; even if you don&#8217;t tell us, we will know, as governments of different countries will inform us,&#8221; said Sars spokesperson Sandile Memela.
