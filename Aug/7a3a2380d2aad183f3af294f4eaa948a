If you want to drop your weight, consider dropping the number of calories that you are consuming. Here are a few simple ways in which you can do this: Cut down your portion size Reduce your portion size of meals gradually by just eating a spoonful or two less of your meal. Depending on what you are eating and how it was prepared, you may be able to save yourself from many calories! Treat or no treat? Try having one treat less a day, for example, if you usually help yourself to three pieces of chocolate daily, drop down to two. Similarly, have one scoop less of ice cream if you tend to enjoy this treat regularly. Sometimes you may find that you may not even need the treat at all! Remember that there is nothing wrong in treating yourself just watch the portion size! Drink fewer high calorie beverages Note that beverages also carry calories with them so if you are indulging in high calorie beverages very often, it may be time to cut down. Consider having a glass less than what you usually indulge in. See a dietician If you need help in creating a diet plan of healthy and balanced meals, seek the help of a dietician.
