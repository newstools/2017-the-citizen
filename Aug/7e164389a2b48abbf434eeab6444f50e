Last year, the Lions found themselves in the South African Rugby Union&#8217;s (Saru) crosshair. As the Springboks moved towards picking nine and ten players of colour in their match squads, the Johannesburg-based union was defiant. Their average hovered around five. Also read: This weekend s talking points from the Currie Cup In the brave new world of aggressive transformation, that was (apparently) not good enough. Of course, the Lions had the reasonable argument that their five regular players of colour &#8211; Elton Jantjies, Courtnall Skosan, Lionel Mapoe and Howard Mnisi &#8211; had become key players. Quality of opportunity over quantity. But in this season&#8217;s Currie Cup campaign, coach Swys de Bruin has instigated change. When the Lions take on the Pumas at Ellis Park on Saturday afternoon, they do so with nine players of colour in their match squad. Seven of them are in the starting line-up. Three weeks ago, there were ten. &#8220;I&#8217;m personally very exciting with the direction we&#8217;re going,&#8221; De Bruin said on Thursday. &#8220;It&#8217;s the right one. Of course we have to add men like Elton, Lionel and Courtnall, who&#8217;ve become Springboks. Then we&#8217;re really looking good on the transformation front. &#8220;It&#8217;s just really pleasing to see how the guys are performing and fitting in.&#8221; De Bruin&#8217;s faith has delivered results, particularly in last weekend&#8217;s agonising defeat to the Cheetahs. 20-year-old eighthman Hacjivah Dayimani made an immediate impact with a try, while Aphiwe Dyantyi &#8211; a Varsity Cup hero for University of Johannesburg &#8211; showed superb playmaking abilities. This weekend, De Bruin hands a debut to 19-year-old centre Manuel Rass. &#8220;We watched him closely at Paarl Boys&#8217; High. He&#8217;s a great youngster,&#8221; said the Lions mentor. &#8220;Manny is stockily built but he&#8217;s got very good ball skills, definitely one for the future. It&#8217;s great to be able to pick him.&#8221; Dayimani, who missed out on selection for the Junior Springboks this year, can attest to the players&#8217; hunger to perform. &#8220;If you asked me two years ago where&#8217;d I&#8217;d be as a player, it wouldn&#8217;t be here,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s been tough playing at this level but the senior players have made it easy. They do the hard yards, I just showcase my talent. It&#8217;s a honour.&#8221;
