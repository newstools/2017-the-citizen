There s nothing like gulping your last burning breaths of oxygen as you cross the finish line. Running encompasses some pain, but its overwhelming moments of euphoria have made it a favourite for centuries just take a look at those ancient Greek amphoras depicting running on display in museums around the world. That could be because there s no bad time for running. Rain, wind, winter or summer, runners take to the streets (or cleared fields, back in antiquity) around the world every day. But like most road runners will know, weekdays are for training and weekends are for collecting yourself some medals to impressively display around your home. If you re new to the running game, navigating the Gauteng running calendar is easier than it seems. Log on to websites like runnersguide.co.za and you might be confused about when and where to run a race. The main confusion sets in when you see races hosted by North Gauteng or Central Gauteng. All you really need to know is North Gauteng road races take place on Saturdays, while Central Gauteng Athletics South Africa-affiliated races take place on Sundays. In even simpler terms: if you enter a race on Saturday you will likely run in Pretoria, while Joburg (and its surrounds) have races on Sundays. It also means if you re from Pretoria or Joburg you have some of the best opportunities to explore your sister city. With the Vitality Run Series dominating the Johannesburg running scene over the next two months, perhaps now is the time to head to Pretoria to see what it has to offer. If you re not affiliated to any running club, just remember to get yourself a temporary licence before pounding the streets.
