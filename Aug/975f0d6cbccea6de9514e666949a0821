It s easy to feel overwhelmed by the bad news of state capture, corruption, junk status, the rand exchange rate or inflation. It s difficult for the good news to shine through the gloom. (And by good news, we mean information which is genuinely positive, and not President Jacob Zuma s idea of good news , which makes him and the ANC look good). The good news that this year s maize harvest is likely to come close to 16 million tons eclipsing 1981 s record of 14.6 million tons has been welcomed by economists, most of whose comments have been pessimistic for the last year or so. One of the biggest impacts of the bumper maize harvest, say these economic experts, is in the potential to significantly bring down food prices by this time next year. Last year, the devastating drought forced South Africa to import five million tons of maize, which increased prices, especially of livestock feed which, in turn, caused meat prices to rise. Although livestock farmers are still struggling to recover (it can take as long as five years to get over the effects of a bad drought), crop farmers are already seeing happier days. It could take a while for the lower feed prices to start affecting meat prices, but the future looks a lot rosier than it did 12 months ago. The dramatic turn-around in the fortunes of the agricultural sector has positive and negative aspects to it. The recovery brought about by good rains emphasises that a situation can change very quickly, as can our mood as a nation. But, at the same time, it reminds us that we are, as a country, heavily dependent on farming to keep our economy going. Now is not the time for reckless policies which could harm our farmers. That would be like taking food out of our own mouths
