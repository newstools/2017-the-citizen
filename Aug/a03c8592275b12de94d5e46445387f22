&#8220;Inexplicably, defendants failed to obtain &#8212; or even seek &#8212; the permission of the composition&#8217;s US copyright holder Rolan Feld,&#8221; said the complaint filed in Los Angeles federal court. &#8220;In the six weeks since Feld brought this infringement to defendant Sony&#8217;s attention, defendants have done little more than point fingers at one another &#8212; and they have neither apologized nor offered to pay Feld a reasonable license fee.&#8221; Feld, Bolan&#8217;s son with Los Angeles singer-songwriter Gloria Jones, was a few days short of his second birthday when the charismatic glam rocker was killed in a car crash at the age of 29. The 41-year-old won the rights to the works of T Rex three years ago and is seeking punitive damages, alleging that Sony Pictures Entertainment&#8217;s use of &#8220;Debora&#8221; has damaged future licensing opportunities. The soundtrack to Edgar Wright&#8217;s &#8220;Baby Driver&#8221; &#8212; which has scored a 95 percent approval rating from more than 250 reviews collated by the Rotten Tomatoes movies website &#8212; is an integral part of the plot. It stars Ansel Elgort (&#8220;The Fault in our Stars&#8221;) as a gifted getaway driver who suffers from tinnitus &#8212; ringing in his ears &#8212; and has to play music on an iPod to concentrate when he is behind the wheel. It has taken $140 million worldwide against an estimated budget of less than a quarter that amount. Debora, released in 1968, was Bolan&#8217;s first hit after forming the psychedelic folk rock band initially known as Tyrannosaurus Rex, reaching number 34 in the British singles chart. A request for comment from Sony&#8217;s media office was not immediately answered.
