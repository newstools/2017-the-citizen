Los Angeles Iconic South African-born race caller Trevor Denman (64), who has called the major race meets in Southern California for more than 30 years and considered by many to be the best in the business, will be inducted into the Southern California Sports Broadcasters Hall of Fame at the 27th annual SCSB awards luncheon on 22 January next year. Denman, who has been Del Mar s announcer since 1984, previously called races at Santa Anita Park, Hollywood Park and Pomona/Fairplex Park during a sparkling career, in addition to tours as the voice of the Breeders Cup. The South African-born s colourful style reshaped the race calling genre in the USA, introducing in-race commentary to what previously had been strictly factual presentations. Denman has told the SCSB board he ll make a special trip from his off-season Minnesota home for the award at the Lake-side Golf Club in Toluca Lake. Also being honored that day will be San Diegan Stu Lantz, who has called Los Angeles Lakers games on radio and television for the past 30 years. Paulick Report.
