Newly crowned champion sire Silvano smashed his own record for earnings in a season and was dominant throughout the 2016- 2017 term. The Maine Chance Farms based German-bred stallion won his second National Sires Championship with earnings of a staggering R27,867,675, which surpassed the record of R20,946,892 he set in the 2012-2013 season. This season he was R8,775,037 clear of the 2014-2015 champion sire, the recently late Captain Al. Silvano recently achieved his fourth victory in the country s premier race, the Vodacom Durban July. He is undoubtedly one of July history s most dominant sires and to emphasise this point he sired Marinaresco, Al Sahem and Nightingale to first, second and tie-fourth in the big race this year, while he famously sired the July trifecta in 2015 and he sired the first and third-placed horses in the 2013 renewal. Silvano had four individual Grade 1 winners this past season and they each won a single Grade 1. They were Marinaresco, Nightingale, Orchid Island and Al Sahem. He was also the leading sire of three-year-olds and dominated in this department too. His three- year-olds earned R11,836,200, which was R4,852,000 clear of second-placed Dynasty. Silvano s average earnings per runner was R126,098 and he had a 54.3% winners to runners ratio. He had 13 individual Black- Type winners of 20 races and all in all from 221 runners had 120 winners of 207 races. A symbol of his dominance this season could be seen in the running of the Grade 2 Gold Bracelet where half of the 10 runners were by him.
