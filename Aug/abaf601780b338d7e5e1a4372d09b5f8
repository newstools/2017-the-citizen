Human history is full of examples of what has come to be known as the law of unintended consequences , where an action aimed at a positive outcome also has a negative impact in unexpected areas. This has turned out to be the case with shark nets off the KwaZulu-Natal coast. They are supposed to protect humans from attacks by sharks and have been in place in some areas for decades. However, the protective value of the nets is now being discussed as it is apparent that the barriers also kill many other sea creatures every year, including dolphins and endangered turtle species. People are petitioning to have the nets lifted in Richards Bay on the North Coast, while the KZN Sharks Board continues to use other methods to kill sharks so bathers can be protected. These other methods are considered the lesser of two evils . The international Blue Flag award organisation, which recognises pristine beaches, is against shark nets and will not grant Blue Flag status to locations where the nets are in place. A Blue Flag accolade is a proven driver of tourism, which is a badly needed provider of income in our country. So, perhaps we need to have a realistic rethink about shark nets.
