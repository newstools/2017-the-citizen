The North Gauteng High Court has set aside public protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane s remedial action to change the South African Reserve Bank&#8217;s (Sarb) constitutional mandate. The judgment on Tuesday was delivered by Justice Cynthia Pretorius, read out on behalf of Judge John Murphy, following the central bank&#8217;s application on August 1 challenging Mkhwebane s recommendation to change the inflection-targeting mandate of Sarb. The recommendation came with her report into the apartheid-era Bankorp bailout. The public protector has been ordered to pay the costs for the legal action.
