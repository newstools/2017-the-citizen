A Pinnacle Stakes comprising a Grade 1 winner and runner-up respectively in Talktothestars and Brutal Force and an up-and-coming sprinting filly in Sommerlied make for a thrilling encounter in this race over 1000m. Under the race conditions Talktothestars looks hard to beat and his opening price of 6-1 is extremely appealing. Coenie de Beer s runner has not won since sneaking home in a Pinnacle Stakes over 1000m at Flamingo Park in October last year but he has hardly disgraced himself either. He finished a 1.30-length second behind Rafeef in the Grade 1 Computaform Sprint over 1000m at Turffontein in May and then suffered quite a lot of interference when attempting to defend his title in the Grade 1 in the Golden Horse Sprint over 1200m at Scottsville later that month. He then ran a neck second behind Search Party in the Grade 2 Post Merchants at Greyville but was unable to overcome a wide draw next time over the same course and distance in the Grade 1 Mercury Sprint won by Bull Valley. He does have a 0.5kg advantage over Brutal Force on merit rating but De Beer s decision to put 2.5kg claimer Ashton Arries on his runner sees that advantage extend to 3kg. That puts Sommerlied at a 5.5kg disadvantage. Dennis Drier s charge has raced four times for three wins and one poor run over 1200m at Kenilworth. She beat the boys when touching off Sergeant Hardy over 1100m at Greyville but a line through the runner-up should see her battle to beat Talktothestars. Would you like to place a bet on the horses?
