The discipline of children to ensure a healthy learning environment is in the hands of their parents, Gauteng education MEC Panyaza Lesufi told parents at Norkem Park High School in Kempton Park in Ekurhuleni on Saturday. Let s join hands to deal with these issues. I addressed your kids, I addressed your students, I saw in their faces that they never thought this form of intervention would come. When we came and spoke to them it brought hope and they accepted that this was the end, Lesufi said. The MEC first visited the East Rand school two weeks ago after videos of violence at the school went viral on social media, with a gun being brandished in one of the videos. On Saturday, he told parents that it was a shame to see grade nine school pupils fighting over boyfriends. Their differences are not about school activities. We can t be proud parents with our children behaving in such a fashion. Lesufi said it pained him to see that schools run by black people were being run down and that when black pupils increased at a school the disorder increased. It worries me when I come here and the school is falling apart. I m going to motivate to the department and invest resources and rehabilitated the grounds that are falling apart. But we must get the discipline right first or the investment will not be appreciated, he said. Following the violent incidents the school suspended 10 girls, two boys were expelled, and two more pupils were suspended for assaulting two teachers while the MEC was on the premises.Eighteen other children were identified as being linked to gangs.
