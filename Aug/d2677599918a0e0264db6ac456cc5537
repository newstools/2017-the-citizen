While their DNA is rooted in the Seattle grunge scene of the early nineties, the band told AFP that turning to British pop diva Adele&#8217;s award-winning producer Greg Kurstin for their ninth studio album, &#8220;Concrete and Gold&#8221;, brought a fresh dimension to their sound. In an interview before headlining the Summer Sonic festival in Tokyo &#8212; where they invited Astley on stage for an improbable mash-up of the eighties pin-up&#8217;s &#8220;Never Gonna Give You Up&#8221; and Nirvana&#8217;s &#8220;Smells Like Teen Spirit&#8221; &#8212; Foo Fighters guitarist Chris Shiflett said: &#8220;People think it&#8217;s a really weird choice for us to work with a pop producer but it made perfect sense. There&#8217;s so much more to Greg and his love of music and knowledge base than just the pop stuff.&#8221; Foo Fighters frontman Dave Grohl, the former Nirvana drummer, chose him to replicate the alchemy he has with Adele, this time with a gnarly rock band. The Foo Fighters shot to fame in the late nineties with hits such as &#8220;This Is A Call,&#8221; &#8220;Monkey Wrench&#8221; and &#8220;Learn To Fly&#8221; and have sold more than 30 million records worldwide &#8220;We weren&#8217;t getting Greg for Adele&#8217;s sound,&#8221; said keyboardist Rami Jaffee, previously a fan of Kurstin&#8217;s indie synthpop duo The Bird and the Bee. &#8220;The Greg we had in the studio was definitely the more adventurous soundscape guy &#8212; he brought more of that stuff,&#8221; he added. &#8220;I thought: &#8216;Oh boy, we&#8217;re getting weird quick!&#8217; This record we really took extra leaps and bounds, sonically.&#8221; Due out next month, the new Foo Fighters album combines thunderous guitar riffs with lush, harmonic textures. Tracks such as &#8220;La Dee Da&#8221; and the Donald Trump-inspired single &#8220;Run&#8221; rock out, but the Foo Fighters shift gears on the dreamy &#8220;Dirty Water&#8221;, while the title track is a slow-burner that features Boyz II Men&#8217;s Shawn Stockman. Beatles legend Paul McCartney also plays drums on one track among several other guest turns, including Alison Mosshart of The Kills. &#8211; Bootleg tape &#8211; &#8220;Paul McCartney is a fan of music,&#8221; said Shiflett, nibbling on vegetable sticks in between photo shoots. &#8220;He only did two passes at the song, which he had never even heard before. Then he just wanted to noodle around so we just jammed on a bunch of other stuff.&#8221; The Foo Fighters shot to fame in the late nineties with hits such as &#8220;This Is A Call,&#8221; &#8220;Monkey Wrench&#8221; and &#8220;Learn To Fly&#8221; and have sold more than 30 million records worldwide. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t join the band until &#8217;99 but I remember a cassette tape bootleg of the first album way before it came out circulating,&#8221; said Shiflett. &#8220;All my friends that were in the know had it and it was just something that would be on the stereo at parties.&#8221; But after a turbulent 2015 when Grohl broke his leg after plunging off the stage and they were forced to cancel a tour, rumours persisted that the group were set to split. &#8220;It would be so dumb for any band to break up,&#8221; insisted guitarist Pat Smear, who also used to tour with Nirvana. &#8220;You just look stupid when you get back together.&#8221; Shiflett believes the secret of the band&#8217;s longevity lies in not taking themselves too seriously, pointing to a spat with Coldplay, who took offence at a mischievous bumper sticker joke in a 2011 Foo Fighters video. &#8220;I remember at the time Chris Martin got super offended and actually got into it with Dave at a kids birthday party or something,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It certainly wasn&#8217;t meant to offend anybody. I don&#8217;t think this band could ever take itself too seriously.&#8221; Jaffee agrees. &#8220;Not taking yourselves too seriously &#8212; all other bands take note,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a very important thing to keep in check and I&#8217;m sorry, Chris Martin, but all our wives love you!&#8221;
