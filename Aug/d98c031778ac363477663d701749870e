The Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) on Tuesday, handed over the last docket to the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) relating to its investigation into the shooting of 34 miners in 2012, at Marikana, in the North West. Ipid spokesperson Moses Dlamini said that the docket was resubmitted on Tuesday, after it was initially submitted in April 2017 but was returned with further directives from the NPA . Ipid investigators have since complied with the NPA s directives and have returned the docket to the NPA, as agreed. The only outstanding matter was the reconstruction of the scene as recommended by the Farlam Commission. The Ipid requested funding from National Treasury to do the reconstruction, without any success, Dlamini said. The matter is now in the hands of the NPA, which will decide whether or not anyone should be charged and if so, what charges should be brought against those implicated. The Ipid will wait for the NPA s further directives and relevant decisions in all matters referred to it. At least 44 people were killed during a violent wage strike at Lonmin platinum mine in Marikana near Rustenburg in 2012, when about 28,000 Lonmin mineworkers went on a wildcat strike demanding to be paid a minimum basic salary of R12,500 per month. On August 16, 2012, 34 mineworkers were gunned down by police. Almost 70 others were wounded. Ten people, including two policemen and two Lonmin security guards, were killed in a week leading up to August 16.
