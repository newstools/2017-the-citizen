DJ Black Coffee s mother Faith Dandala is allegedly invovled in a nine-year debt scandal involving a Durban-based businessman who wants his money back. Bongani Ngcobo has told Sunday Sun Faith borrowed R40, 000 from him in January 2008 and hasn t paid a cent back for the loaned cash. Ngcobo claims he loaned her the cash when she was still a close family friend. At the time she owned Sonke Office Supplies, a business that used to supply office stationary for different government departments and companies, he said. Ngcobo said the drama allegedly started when Faith contacted him in January 2008 asking him to come to her rescue when she received a job to supply stationary. She told me she needed monetary assistance of R40, 000, as she wanted to order stationary urgently for delivery. She said she didn t have enough money because the other companies she had supplied last year had not paid her, he said. After I had deposited the money into her company s bank account, Faith called me into her office in Berea, Durban, where she wrote a one-line stamped letter confirming she had received the money. It was only six month later, when Faith allegedly failed to keep to her side of the deal to pay back the money at the end of March in 2008, that Ngcobo cliams she started avoiding him. She told me she was unable to pay me back because her company had been liquidated she phoned me again and told me she had relocated to Cape Town. I kept tracing her whereabouts until I discovered that she had, in fact, moved to Bluff in Durban, he said. Ngcobo said all he wanted was his money back. He said he decided to open a case of theft under false pretences at the Phoenix Police Station for investigation, and Faith told him she was well-connected . Police have confirmed the case was opned and said no arrests had been made. ALSO READ: Cici s lawyers want Arthur to be charged with reckless driving
