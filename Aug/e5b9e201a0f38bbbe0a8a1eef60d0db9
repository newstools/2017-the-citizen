Vodacom said on Wednesday that it would give all customers affected by a recent billing systems error a 500MB data bundle for free, over and above the airtime and data refunds processed by the company. This comes after the largest mobile operator in South Africa trended on social media on Monday and Tuesday with subscribers complaining that their data and airtime was disappearing. Vodacom said the system error, which impacted certain prepaid and top-up customers, was caused by a configuration change on its prepaid and top-up billing system. The company said it swiftly isolated the problem and rolled the process back, and worked hard to ensure that all affected customers were refunded in full. Vodacom chief executive Shameel Joosub said the error clearly caused inconvenience to the service provider s customers, adding they had worked very hard since they picked it up to make it right and refund all affected customers. But we wanted to go a step further to apologise and thank our customers for their loyalty, so we ve taken the decision to give each affected customer a free 500MB bundle which they can use over three days, Joosub said in a statement. An error of this kind has never happened before and we ve taken steps to ensure it never recurs. We d like to assure all our customers that this was simply an error caused during a configuration change and nothing more than that. We hope our customers will appreciate the gesture, and our apology. The phenomenon of disappearing and very high costs of data have prompted the Competition Commission to launch an inquiry. The inquiry will assess, among others, the market structure, the general adequacy and impact of the current regulatory regime, and costs faced and profits earned by fixed and mobile network operators.
