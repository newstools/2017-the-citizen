Discussing &#8220;Snowfall,&#8221; his new drama on the emergence of crack in Los Angeles, the &#8220;Boyz N The Hood&#8221; director, who is black, said authorities had &#8220;criminalized a whole generation&#8221; as the drug flooded the streets. Now far from being thrown in jail, meanwhile, the mostly white consumers of opioids across the United States are treated as unfortunate victims. &#8220;It was unfair at the time and it would be today,&#8221; he said of the idea of extending the tough treatment to consumers of opioids &#8212; powerful and addictive painkilling drugs that cause more than 20,000 US deaths a year. US cable channel FX announced on Wednesday that it had ordered a second series of &#8220;Snowfall,&#8221; which gets around a million US viewers a show, almost the average for an FX series. Created by Singleton and Eric Amadio, &#8220;Snowfall&#8221; is set on the mean streets of LA&#8217;s South Central, and depicts the infancy of the crack cocaine epidemic and its radical impact on the culture. The story follows characters on a violent collision course, including a Mexican wrestler caught up in a power struggle within a crime family, the self-possessed daughter of a Mexican crime lord and a CIA operative who begins an off-book operation to fund the Nicaraguan Contra rebels. &#8220;There&#8217;s a whole lot of people that grew up in that environment and suffered from the effects you see, the slow decay of the environment and the effect on these characters,&#8221; Singleton said. He believes that drug-related crime &#8212; from the heroin crisis of the 1970s, through crack and opioids &#8212; is partly down to &#8220;the politicians who think, &#8216;Now, just let them be on narcotics'&#8221; as a means to mollify the populace.
