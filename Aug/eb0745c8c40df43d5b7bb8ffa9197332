Middle-distance specialist Caster Semenya lined up her title charge in the women&#8217;s 800m event on Friday night, coasting to victory in her semifinal at the IAAF World Championships in London. The Olympic champion, who earned the 1 500m bronze medal earlier in the week, covered the two-lap contest in 1:58.90, and she was hardly out of breath after she crossed the line.

Obviously the final will be about how you calculate your lap, especially your last 300m,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The main thing for us now is that we have a strong field, but we&#8217;ll just try to relax as much as we can so we can do better in the final. &#8220;But you can&#8217;t tell much, you can&#8217;t underestimate your opponents, you can&#8217;t calculate or measure them. It&#8217;s just about trying to enjoy your race.&#8221; While she progressed safely to Sunday&#8217;s final, there was no more luck for Gena Lofstrand who was knocked out. Having delivered a superb effort by her own standards to reach the penultimate round, Lofstrand struggled in her semifinal, finishing eighth in 2:03.67. With two days of competition left at the biennial spectacle, the SA team have bagged five medals (two gold, one silver and two bronze) and Semenya was the squad&#8217;s last real hope for another podium finish.
