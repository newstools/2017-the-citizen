				                 While Cele has no qualms serving under Dlamini-Zuma who is set to contest the position of ANC president at the party’s elective conference next weekend – he believes that the people on her slate are not to be trusted and are in cahoots with the influential Gupta family.
According to City Press, Cele said he had worked with Dlamini-Zuma and knew her well however he was still not convinced that her slate would push SA in the right direction.
“Her line-up is the Guptas’ lineup. That means this war that we are fighting against the damage the Guptas are doing will be perpetuated. It means that one day, the headquarters of the ANC will go to Saxonwold.
Dlamini-Zuma’s slate is understood to include Mpumalanga premier, David Mabuza and Jessie Duarte who serves as the deputy secretary general of the ANC.

“The Guptas landed at the military base, used blue lights to go their wedding and got R30 million from the Free State government and then you say that (Ace Magushule) must be a secretary?”
The Free State has backed Dlamini-Zuma and Magashule is understood to be a fierce loyalist of President Jacob Zuma.
Cele said he supported Ramaphosa because he was given former president Nelson Mandela’s backing to go into business. He also said that Ramaphosa did not have shady business dealings and was capable and competent.
“That thing of him being capital friendly must be stopped. He never took his money from the Guptas. If anyone claims his money was ill-gotten, they must come with proof,” said Cele.
