Dar es Salaam. Miss Universe Tanzania, Lilian Erica Maraure has secured a contract to feature in various fashion shows in the US But despite winning such a lucrative deal, Lilian seems to be in a complaining mood as she habours a feeling that she was denied the opportunity into the Top 16 despite the fact that she dominated website and social media votes. The contest which was held at The AXIS at Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas, saw Demi-Leigh Nel-Peters of South Africa emerge winner. According managing director of Compass Communications, Maria Sarungi Lilian may feature in the next year’s Las Vegas fashion shows following her performance at the Miss Universe pageant. Maria said apart from securing these deals, Lilian has also been awarded a scholarship to study in US and she is expected to choose her field of expertise. “It is good for us our queen has made us proud by securing these offers despite the fact that she did not do well in the pageant, we will meet with her and discuss the offers,” said Sarungi.
