God Father East Africa, widely touted to be the East African version of Big Brother Africa (BBA), is set to be aired in early 2018. Like in BBA, millions of cash will be up for grabs for the last contestant standing. They will be battling it out for Sh2.5 million. The last BBA in 2014 was won by Tanzanian photographer Idris Sultan. Producers, led by Allan Komba who works with EATV, have been conducting a series of meetings with the recent one happening in Nairobi, so as to ensure that the reality show takes off in the early months of 2018. Plans for the God Father East Africa auditions are at an advanced stage and will be carried out in Nairobi, Kigali, Kampala and Dar es Salaam. “If you are selected by the producers, you must be willing to travel at your own expense to be auditioned at a time to be scheduled .”
