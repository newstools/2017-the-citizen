				                 Matlala spent a night in jail at the Olifantsfontein police station after his ex-girlfriend Lebohang Mabe opened charges of assault against him.
Sunday Sun reports that Mabe’s statement read that Matlala threw out of his house at night and brought in a new girl moments later.
“He said he was tired of me and wanted me to leave. When I told him I was not going anywhere, he then slapped me twice and pushed me against the wall,” said Mabe.
Mabe also alleges that her former beau threatened her life after she left.
Matlala has also opened a case against his one time lover for malicious damage to property. She spent the night in a cell on Friday night.
Matlala is out on bail of R1 000 and will appear in court next month.
Nico and Lebo set social media alight a few months ago when he bragged about taking Lebo from Shaun Stylist, a popular fashionista. A Facebook account was opened, from which the person behind it mocked Shaun.
Matlala has been romantically linked to actress Palesa Madisakwane and singer KB.
