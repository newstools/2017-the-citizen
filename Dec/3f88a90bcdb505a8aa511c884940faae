				                 Six people, including three driving licence examiners, were arrested for corruption and a testing centre in the Nkowankowa township outside Tzaneen in Limpopo, was closed on Tuesday, Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) said on Tuesday.
Spokesperson Simon Zwane said after a 18-month long investigation the six were arrested in a joint operation by the RTMC’s National Traffic Anti-corruption unit and the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (better known as the Hawks) in Nkowankowa.
“The arrests followed 18 months of investigation in which undercover operatives, working under Operation Code 14, identified officers involved in corruption at driving licence centre. The investigation led to the arrest of three driving licence examiners and three civilian facilitators who allegedly touted on their behalf,” he said.
“The officers aged 55, 49 and 46 are to appear at the Ritavi Magistrates’ Court this week, and they will be joined in the dock by the civilians who are aged between 37 and 57. It is alleged that the civilians acted as middlemen who facilitated the payment of bribes between licence applicants and examiners.”
Zwane said the testing centre was closed after all the examiners were arrested while the other two were being sought.
He said that anti-corruption officers have identified corruption and bribery in the issuing of driving documents. He said this was a contributing factor behind the country’s high accident rate.
“Untrained and unfit drivers commit avoidable mistakes and cause unnecessary crashes that lead to injuries and fatalities.”
