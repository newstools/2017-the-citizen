Dar es Salaam. Diamond Platnums is set to release his sophomore album ‘A Boy from Tandale’ today and to give his fan base a taste of what the album is likely to contain the singer this week released two songs. The songs titles ‘Niache’ and ‘Sikomi’ are both slow tempo highlighting some of his latest struggles and regrets in his chase for romance. The lyrics look like a diss to most of his past flames such as Wema, Penny and regrets of his recent cheating scandal that was hit in the social media. From the rest of the content Diamond sounds a very tired man romantically and he blames his choices in the past who have come up with teams on the social media. It is not clear whether this is the route that the Bongo Flava singer has chosen to take throughout the album. The album according to WCB insiders will be available online and other platforms such as Wasafi.com.
