				                 Outgoing ANC president Jacob Zuma has encouraged delegates attending this weekend’s national conference to take a firm decision that will ensure those who take the governing party to court are expelled from the organisation.
Zuma said the ANC had been taken to court so frequently that it had lead to a situation that “gradually” erodes the authority of the party.
“We can’t begin to believe courts are a solution to ANC’s problems unless it’s a matter the ANC has failed to resolve, and you feel strongly about it. You can’t treat the courts as an internal structure of the ANC. That is totally wrong,” Zuma said to loud applause from some provincial delegates.
“I wish this conference can discuss this matter. In the past we have taken decisions and but had not implemented them. If we implemented them we could have curbed this sickness,” he told cheering delegates.
“Those who take the party to court declare themselves as non-ANC members. We can’t have an organisation that is taken to court everyday. Some who don’t stay in South Africa might believe that this organisation is corrupt.
“Let us take a decision and if we have taken the decision let us implement it. If the leadership fails to implement let us deal with that. It is important that we deal with this matter so we are out of courts so that we can use ANC instruments,” he said.
