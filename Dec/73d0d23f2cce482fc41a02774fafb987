				                 One person was killed and another sustained minor injuries after the bakkie they were traveling in veered off the Rysmierbult road close to Klerkskraal and rolled, ER24 Spokesperson Ineke van Huyssteen said on Sunday.
“When ER24 paramedics arrived on the scene at 21.35 pm [Saturday night], they found the driver of the bakkie still seated in the front seat. Unfortunately, there was nothing paramedics could do for the man and he was declared dead on the scene,” said Van Huyssteen.
A male passenger with minor injuries was found on the scene. He was treated before he was taken to Mediclinic Potchefstroom.
Police are probing the fatal crash.
