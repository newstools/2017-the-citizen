				                 Pretoria businessman Omar Carrim, who was kidnapped 137 days ago shortly after leaving his Home Hyper City business, has been released, and has been reunited with his family.
“I can confirm the release of Omar Carrim, 76. He was released in Olifantsfontein this evening at about 10.30pm,” said anti-crime activist Yusuf Abramjee.
Carrim has been admitted to an undisclosed hospital, where he is getting the required medical attention.
“We appeal for privacy. Let’s give the victim and his family the time and space to recover from the ordeal,” said Abramjee.
The 76-year-old businessman was kidnapped on 3 August.
He said the Carrim family has thanked relatives, friends and the community “for all the support and assistance since he disappeared in early August. We are most grateful to everyone, and we thank the Almighty for returning our father and brother to us”.
“Thank you for all the prayers and the moral support from the public.”
“We also thank law enforcement agencies,” added Abramjee.
“Omar Carrim and his family will not be commenting any further on this matter for now … We are just grateful he has been safely returned.”
Police could not be immediately reached for comment.
