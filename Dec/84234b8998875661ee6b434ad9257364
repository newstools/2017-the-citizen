				                 Four people were critically injured, including a 10-year-old girl, and three of them were airlifted to hospital after two cars collided on the N12 outside Fochville in Gauteng, paramedics said on Sunday.
ER24 paramedics, along with other services, arrived on the scene to find the two cars on the side of the road, ER24 spokesman Russel Meiring said.
Upon closer inspection, paramedics found a man trapped inside one of the cars. An elderly woman and another woman, believed to be in her 30s, were found trapped inside the second car, while the 10-year-old girl was found lying outside one of the cars.
Paramedics assessed the patients and found that all four had sustained numerous injuries and was in a critical condition.
“The patients were treated for their injuries and were provided with advanced life support interventions. Once treated, three patients were airlifted, two by the ER24 Oneplan helicopter, to nearby hospitals for further treatment. The remaining patient was transported by ambulance to a nearby hospital.”
The cause of the collision was not yet known but local authorities were on the scene for further investigations, Meiring said.
