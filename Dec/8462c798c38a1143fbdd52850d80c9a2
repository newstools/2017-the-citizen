				                 Police in Polokwane are investigating a case of culpable homicide after four people died in a head-on collision on the R37 between Lebowakgomo and  Polokwane, next to the Zebediela Bricks plant, Limpopo police said on Sunday.
The driver of a red Mazda 2, heading towards Lebowakgomo, and his three passengers allegedly “noticed a white Hundai coming from the opposite direction moving in a wrong lane”.
He tried to swerve his car to the other side to avoid a collision, “but it was late, which led to this head-on collision”. Three of the occupants in the Mazda died, as well as the Hyundai driver. The third passenger in the Mazda was seriously injured.
“The process of identifying the deceased is still unfolding. The cause of this collision is still unknown, but the ongoing police investigations will tell,” Ngoepe said.
