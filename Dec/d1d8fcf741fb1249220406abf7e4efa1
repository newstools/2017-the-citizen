				                 Out of the 3 499 newly-trained police officers countrywide, only 12 of them were white youth, a recruitment concern that the South African Police Service would address, Fikile Mbalula said yesterday.
The police minister was speaking at the SAPS Tshwane training academy’s passing-out parade where he welcomed new men and women in blue who had completed their basic police training programme countrywide.
But he appealed to South Africa’s white youth to participate in serving their country since it “is their home, too”.
“I want them to come and join the ranks of the police and to understand that policing is a good career,” said Mbalula.
