				                 ER24, the South African Police Service (SAPS) search and rescue team, and the Metro rescue team were called to the scene by members of the off-road rescue unit, ER24 spokeswoman Ineke van Huyssteen said.
“It is believed that the man and his friend were riding motorbikes on the mountain when he fell from a height. After some time, ER24 paramedics got to the man and found him to have sustained serious injuries. When they finally got him to level ground, he was airlifted by a South African Air Force helicopter to Mediclinic Tzaneen for further medical care.”
The circumstances surrounding the accident were not yet known, Van Huyssteen said.
