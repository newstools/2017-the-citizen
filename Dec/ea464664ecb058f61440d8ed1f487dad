				                 One of the most entertaining aspects of #ANC54 which came to a close in the early hours of Thursday morning was the singing. Security’s over-zealously shielded media against delegates and other leaders throughout the conference.
But determining which camp the various groups of delegates, who spent a fair amount of time moving between the plenary and commissions and break-away caucuses, belonged to was simple if you were able to decipher messages in the songs.
The Limpopo province and its four regions – Capricorn, Vhembe, Sekhukhune and Mopani – were distinguishable in its signature traditional wedding songs with anti-Zuma lyrics composed for the conference. They also could put a few ‘Our Perfect Wedding’ couples with their meticulously executed choreography to shame.
The province got embroiled in the saga of ‘missing’ 68 votes that were quarantined as the conference steering committee members and Elexions officials decreed that they can not be counted as the names of those delegates did not appear on the voter’s roll. The votes were eventually counted but didn’t affect the outcome of Top Six results.
This saw various branches and regions of the province venting out their anger, as they alleged their votes for Senzo Mchunu were suppressed, in song. In the song below, they are saying “Zuma is gone, so will theft” in Sepedi.
