A woman and her lover appeared in the Moretele Magistrates Court in Hammanskraal on Thursday for allegedly killing her husband and burying him in the bush, Gauteng police said. Police spokesperson Captain Kay Makhubela said the case against Fikile Mongwe, 36, who appeared briefly with co-accused Innocent Pilosa, 21, was postponed to February 23 to give them time to apply for legal aid representatives. The pair are charged with murdering Selaelo Lekalakala, a government employee who was set to retire this year. Mongwe had recently married Lekalakala after having worked for him as a housekeeper following the death of his wife in 2014.

Makhubela said an accomplice who took part in the concealment of the body approached the police to reveal the mystery behind Lekalakala s disappearance. He told police that the wife s boyfriend, who is also his friend, had called him on December 31, asking him to help him carry a load of rubbish to the bush. He helped the couple carry the body at night, which was wrapped in a blanket and stuffed in a big tub. They dug a hole, but it was too shallow, and they allegedly left the body there and returned the next evening to dig deeper. The accomplice, who has turned state witness, told police he realised on the second night that what was actually being buried was a human. &#8211; African News Agency For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
