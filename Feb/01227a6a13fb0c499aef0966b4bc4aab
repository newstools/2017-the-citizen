President Jacob Zuma, after applying his mind, opted not to suspend or to institute an inquiry into the fitness of the National Prosecuting Authority&#8217;s (NPA s) Advocate Lawrence Mrwebi and Advocate Nomgcobo Jiba to hold office. According to a presidency statement, the president is using the fact that their disbarment as advocates is now subject to appeal, since the North Gauteng High Court granted the two prosecutors leave to appeal its earlier decision. Mrwebi is special director of public prosecutions and Jiba a deputy national director of public prosecutions. She also served as acting head of the NPA for an extended period. Presidency spokesperson Bongani Ngqulunga said in a statement that Jiba and Mrwebi were invited to make written representations as to why they should not be suspended, pending the outcome of an inquiry into their fitness to hold office. Having considered the representations made by Adv Jiba and Adv Mrwebi, and the decision of the North Gauteng High Court to grant the two prosecutors leave to appeal, the President has decided not to suspend them or institute any inquiry until the finalisation of the leave process, the statement said. The two are still on special leave. They were struck off the roll in September. Despite that, they were not suspended from the NPA. Both have long controversially been seen as Zuma loyalists.
