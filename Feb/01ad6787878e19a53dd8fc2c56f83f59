Pigcasso, obviously a name that was inspired by Spanish painter Pablo Picasso, is a rescue pig that does not behave like a normal pig would. She was rescued, along with her sister Rosie, from a farming factory operation in the Western Cape last year. According to her owner, founder and director of Farm Sanctuary SA Joanne Lefson, when she arrived at her new home, she was given paintbrushes, balls and other toys to play with. But for some reason, she found the paintbrushes fascinating. &#8220;From that point forward, we figured that an artistic talent was in the making.&#8221; Pigcasso&#8217;s painting videos have reached more than 20 million views across all social media platforms. All her paintings will be on an exhibition in Cape Town and the proceeds will go to Farm Sanctuary SA and hopefully &#8220;inspire consumers to make more compassionate choices&#8221;, says Lefson. Apart from painting, Pigcasso loves to sleep for most of the day, according to her owner. Watch a video of the pig painting that was posted on the South Africa Is Awesome Facebook page:
