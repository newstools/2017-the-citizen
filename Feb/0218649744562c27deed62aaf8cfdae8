A South African doctor who was trained in Cuba, and a student nurse, died in separate incidents at the weekend in KwaZulu-Natal. The doctor, who worked at Prince Mshiyeni Memorial Hospital (PMMH), had been out at Umlazi with his friends. However, when he got back to his room he became distressed and was brought by friends to casualty at PMMH. Sadly, he was certified dead on arrival, said the department of health in KZN on Monday. Department spokesperson Desmond Motha said: It is alleged that a student male nurse committed suicide by jumping from the 16th floor of a building at Addington Hospital on Sunday afternoon and he demised immediately. KwaZulu-Natal MEC for health Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo said: We are always very saddened when we lose our staff members. It is even worse when we lose our clinical cadres as this sets back our quest to provide universal access to healthcare for people in every corner of the province . Dhlomo said in this instance the province had lost a doctor whose contribution was invaluable. On the other hand, it is also sad to lose a student nurse from whom so much was still expected by his family, the department and community at large.
