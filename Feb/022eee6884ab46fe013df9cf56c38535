City of Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba on Thursday, cut his meeting with the residents of Rosettenville short due to African National Congress (ANC) members who were chanting and saying he was disrespectful. Community leader and ANC member Simphiwe Hlafa said Mashaba was being disrespectful for holding a meeting on the same day as President Jacob Zuma s state of the nation address (Sona). As residents of Rosettenville we have challenges but today s meeting could wait, we should have been watching Sona. We appreciate that the mayor is attempting to resolve these issues, but not in a manner that seeks to divide our community and undermine the national government, said Hlafa.

Today s meeting was a direct provocation to the national government, so when you provoke the leading party, you are provoking us, the people who voted for the president. Hlafa said it was not a theory that Nigerian nationals were the ones dealing in drugs in Rosettenville. We didn t just wake up and target Nigerians, we know these brothels and when we got there they were all operated by them. Hlafa said they would meet as a community on Saturday and continue to raid the houses suspected to be drug dens and brothels. Mashaba said that it was his declaration to keep the streets of Rosettenville safe from criminals. I hate criminals with a passion, I will make their lives difficult. I know Rosettenville residents don t want excuses from us, they want action. It is then my responsibility to make sure they are safe, said Mashaba. Mashaba urged community members to come forward with their grievances to their leaders and he would then meet with them and find a way forward.
