Lundi Tyamara&#8217;s family has reportedly not been approached by any government official about a state funeral state for the late gospel legend. Minister of Arts and Culture Nathi Mthethwa has visited the family and asked their spokesperson and Lundi&#8217;s manager, Anele Hlazo, about any shortages for funeral arrangements, but without any mention of a state funeral. As it stands, Lundi will not be getting a state funeral, unlike fellow musicians Sfiso Ncwane and Thandi Klaasen, who recently passed on.
