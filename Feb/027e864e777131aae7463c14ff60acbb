New York. Victoria Beckham sought to empower women. Public School tore into the Donald Trump presidency. Altuzarra delved into Shakespearean tragedy: political climes loomed large over New York fashion week Sunday.Subtle digs or angry opposition to the Donald Trump presidency have colored much of the first four days of the bi-annual style bonanza, mirroring the deep malaise in liberal America over changing times.Beckham sought to overcome her husband's simmering email scandal by unveiling another beautifully tailored collection of clothes, her football legend husband and their children sitting in the front row.It was David Beckham's most high-profile public appearance since the scandal broke, arriving with children Brooklyn, Romeo, Cruz and Harper after sending his wife a bouquet of flowers and a good luck card.The leak of expletive-laden emails in which he apparently raged about not receiving a knighthood have battered his squeaky-clean image in Britain and had threatened to overshadow his wife's fashion show. But fashion editors, buyers and fans braved heavy rain in New York on Sunday morning for one thing only: a fall/winter 2017 collection that sought to keep Beckham's loyal, international clientele happy.There was a London feel with sharply tailored and oversized masculine outerwear, gentleman's club colors of oxblood, navy and black and more feminine rose-beige, powder blue and lipstick red. It was a strong look made sexy and feminine with chiffon and georgette skirts, leather gloves worn to the elbow, and wedge and heeled boots."Never has there been a time where it is more important to empower women," Beckham told reporters. "There is so much going on at the moment in the world and I think that we have to be optimistic. We have to be positive," she said. (AFP)
