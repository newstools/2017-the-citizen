If the government s ruling elite ever had any doubts about swearing in discredited former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe as a member of parliament, the reaction from the SA Communist Party (SACP) must have removed any uncertainties. General secretary Blade Nzimande came out strongly against Molefe s sudden and controversial elevation to a seat in the House of Assembly, unequivocally calling the issue factional and divisive . It was another wedge driven into the crumbling foundations of the formerly impregnable redoubt of the tripartite alliance from which the ANC has fought off repeated attempts to unseat it. But it is clearly one that, while it might temporarily bolster the laager around President Jacob Zuma and his faithful, it is a gambit that has all the hallmarks of failure in the endgame. And with schism after schism within the ranks of the ruling party belying any real semblance of a truly united front, Nzimande s words give strong indication that the SACP might well as it has hinted in the past contest the next general election on its own. This is a move critics have been saying for years should have been done in the first place, rather than cowering behind the ANC. The third pillar of the alliance, the powerful union federation, is also badly splintered. Zwelinzima Vavi, the former head of Cosatu who&#8217;s now giving the impression of being a toothless bulldog is sitting on the sidelines. Observers and the force of persistent bubbling rumour would have it that Vavi is merely awaiting the opportune moment to gather his followers and announce an independent labour-oriented party that could truly blow the alliance asunder. It all indicates that there is, lurking in this uncertainty underlying South Africa s political future, the growing chance that Zuma s shaky house of cadres could come crashing down.
