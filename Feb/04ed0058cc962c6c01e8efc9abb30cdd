We will be unfortunate not to have on board a host of our key players in our next two or three matches, said Mwankemwa.Azam, who sit third in the league standing with 34 points, 12 adrift of league leaders Young Africans and 11 behind second-placed Simba, will be seeking to maintain their winning run when they host Ndanda FC at the Chamazi Complex.
