A potentially shrewd piece of business or a waste of time? That&#8217;s the question hanging over the Bulls&#8217; decision to possibly recruit former Springbok winger Cornal Hendricks. The Pretoria-based franchise on Thursday confirmed the 28-year-old, who played 12 Tests under Heyneke Meyer in 2014 and 2015, will pop up at Loftus for &#8220;medical and fitness training&#8221;. What that actually means is that Hendricks needs to prove he&#8217;s healthy enough to play top-level rugby again. Also read: Nyakane to Kriel: How does the Bulls squad stack up? He has been in the wilderness for about 18 months after being diagnosed with a severe heart condition. The South African Rugby Union even ended his national contract early. But the determined Hendricks got a second opinion that actually cleared him, convincing French giants Toulon to take him on trail. Springbok veterans Duane Vermeulen and Bryan Habana are on the club&#8217;s payroll. However, Toulon eventually declined as doubts over his health persisted. The Bulls aren&#8217;t fazed. &#8220;We understand the potential health issues and risks and have asked a number of leading specialist in their field to give us their assessments,&#8221; said Xander Janse van Rensburg, the Bulls&#8217; high performance manager. &#8220;Player welfare has always been a non-negotiable priority in the Bulls set-up and will always be seen more important than short term results. We are confident though that Cornal will be cleared and will join us.&#8221; Should that happen, the Bulls could probably come away with a bargain contract as Hendricks&#8217; market value definitely won&#8217;t be as high in previous years. Hendricks&#8217; experience could also be valuable to Nollis Marais&#8217; team. Jamba Ulengo en Travis Ismaiel are an established, first-choice pair on the wings but the Bulls lack wisdom in that department otherwise.
