The SA cricket team couldn t have asked for a better start to their tour of New Zealand than their 78-run win over the Black Caps in the T20 international in Auckland on Friday. The batsmen, with the exception of Quinton de Kock, all delivered. The bowlers and in particular Chris Morris and Imran Tahir were world-class, and the fielding was top notch. You always want to start a tour with a bang, and despite missing out on their only warm-up match this week due to the weather, the Proteas have done exactly that. The victory will give the Proteas huge confidence ahead of the five-match one-day international series that starts in Hamilton on Sunday. Not that the national cricketers needed a confidence boost after enjoying a rich vein of form over the last seven months. The only blotch on the scorecard for the Proteas since August last year was a T20 series defeat to Sri Lanka on home soil. Since then they have won six out of eight Tests, including a third straight away Test series triumph over Australia, and 11 one-day internationals in a row a streak that includes two 5-0 series whitewashes. New Zealand may be fresh off a series victory over neighbours Australia, but South Africa are ranked No 1 in the world in limited-overs cricket for good reason and have certainly found their rhythm.
