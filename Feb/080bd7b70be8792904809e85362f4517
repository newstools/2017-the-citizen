Kampala. Lack of ruthlessness has often been cited by KCCA coach Mike Mutebi as to why Ugandan clubs are rarely referred to as high scoring.His team are the highest scorers in the domestic league at an average of 1.86 goals per game after 16 games.He was left to echo similar sentiments at the Phillip Omondi Stadium on Friday with his team only taking a slim lead going into next Sunday s Preliminary round Caf Champions League return leg against Angola s Clube Desportivo Primeiro de Agosto.KCCA won 1-0 courtesy of a Geoffrey Sserunkuma strike but the tactician was largely not impressed with his side s display on the day. Very good result but it would have been beautiful if our players were not careless. It would have been a 3-0. The most important thing when playing continental football is to be disciplined and keep a clean sheet which we did, Mutebi explained before making a frank assessment of his forward players. The way we play we are supposed to create chances which we did, he said. (NMG)
