Mexican Formula One driver Sergio &#8220;Checo&#8221; Perez joined on Thursday a campaign by the Mexico Grand Prix opposing US President Donald Trump&#8217;s plan to build a border wall. The racetrack&#8217;s Twitter account shows a photo of the Force India driver under a banner that reads &#8220;#BridgesNotWalls&#8221; at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez speedway along with people holding the Mexican flag. &#8220;It represents many Mexican motorsport fans&#8217; views currently, it&#8217;s a call to action inviting fans to build bridges, not barriers,&#8221; the Grand Prix organizers said in a statement that does not mention Trump&#8217;s name but is clearly directed at his wall plans. Trump has angered Mexicans and caused a diplomatic row by vowing to make their country pay for the massive border barrier. In November, Perez dropped one of his sponsors, sunglasses maker Hawkers, after a message mocking Mexicans appeared on the company&#8217;s Twitter account following Trump&#8217;s election. Another Mexican sports star, veteran national team skipper Rafael Marquez, fired a Twitter volley at Trump last month, writing that &#8220;No wall can stop us if we believe in ourselves.&#8221; Marquez posted the phrase next to a video of him firing home a trademark freekick from his days playing with Barcelona.
