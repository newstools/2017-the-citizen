The SABC s questionable relationship with Gupta-owned 24-hour news channel ANN7 has been laid bare by the public broadcaster&#8217;s former CEO Phil Molefe, with new evidence suggesting the SABC paid more than R1 million for an episode of The New Age (TNA) breakfast show broadcast on SABC2. Parliament s ad hoc committee established to probe the fitness of the SABC&#8217;s defunct board to hold office, on Tuesday revealed that Molefe, in his submissions to the committee, gave evidence that the parastatal footed the bill associated with the controversial breakfast briefings that feature high-ranking government officials.

The TNA media group bagged the revenue generated from the joint briefings. The SABC also footed the bill for flights, accommodation and food for its production staff when the briefings took place outside Johannesburg. Molefe also indicated that the contract for the TNA breakfast briefings was signed when he was no longer the SABC s acting CEO. It was allegedly signed by former CEO Lulama Mokhobo and then TNA CEO Nazeem Howa. The committee plans to complete its final report before the end of February, and has indicated it wants the deal to be reviewed. For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
