Just Sensual, winner of the World Sports Bet ting Cape Fillies Guineas in December, is the high est-rated horse among the 30 entries for the R250,000 Grade 3 Vasco Prix du Cap over 1400m at Kenilworth on Saturday, 25 February and she has a good draw, which will be important over this trip. She has had only one run since her classic triumph when Frankie Dettori rode her in the $500,000 CTS Mile on Sun Met Day. She made the early running but faded to finish down the field behind William Longsword. The Joey Ramsden-trained filly may well be opposed by last sea son s Cape Fillies Guineas winner Silver Mountain who started fa vourite for the Grade 1 Klawervlei Majorca Stakes but managed only fifth to stable companion Night ingale. She is drawn in mid-field whereas she was drawn on the wide outside in the Majorca. Goodtime Gal, third in the Ma jorca from draw No 3, has a poor draw this time but is expected to run and could be up against sev eral others who ran in the Majorca including Captain s Flame (sev enth), A Time To Dream (eighth), Neala (10th), Beach Goddess (11th) and Alexis (15th) who was fourth in this event last year and went on to take the Tibouchina Stakes in Durban. Grade 1 winners carry a 3kg penalty, Grade 2 winners 2kg ex tra and Grade 3 winners 1kg extra. There is a supplementary entry stage on Friday and declarations are on Monday, 20 February. This is the celebrated Cape Town Prawn Festival meeting which attracts a big crowd. Last year s attendance was estimated at 7,000 and 2.5 tons of prawns were sold. This time R50,000 worth of prizes will be given away includ ing a grand prize of R20,000 worth of home appliances.
