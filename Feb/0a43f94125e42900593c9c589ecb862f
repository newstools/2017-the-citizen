According to Brand Finance, the index shows relatively higher levels of trust and loyalty in Chinese banks than European or American banks, which have had to weather major banking scandals in the past. The combination of domestic loyalty and rapidly improving international recognition and respect has resulted in formidable brand equity results for China s banks, it said. ICBC, the world s biggest bank by assets, not only topped the Brand Score Index, it is also rated the most valuable banking brand in the world. As per Brand Finance Calculations, it s brand value increased by 32% year-on-year to $47.8 billion dollars, which is equivalent to 20% of its $239 billion market capitalisation.
