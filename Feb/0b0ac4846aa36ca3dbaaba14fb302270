Police are looking for a group of suspects who allegedly entered a Spur restaurant in Halfway Gardens, robbed customers and took an undisclosed amount of money from the tills. Police said about 12 armed men entered the restaurant on Thursday and robbed the shop and 30 patrons, and one of the patrons was shot in the arm. They allegedly took cellphones and wallets belonging to customers and an undisclosed amount of money from the till, Midrand Reporter reports. Midrand police station captain Lionel Chetty said about nine men walked into the Spur and robbed customers and the business. It is suspected that the robbers used a white Ford Estcourt, a grey BMW and a black Polo as getaway cars. We are appealing to the community for information on the whereabouts of the suspects, or whatever might help the police with investigations, said Gauteng police spokesperson Mavela Masondo. Restaurant manager Michael Mthupa said: I cannot say anything at the moment. The case is under investigation. Centre owner Nicholas Soce said two guards, who were on duty when the robbery occurred, were held at gunpoint and forced into the restaurant. The guards were on patrol when the incident took place. One of them pressed the panic button and armed response arrived within five minutes, said Soce. The injured customer was taken to a nearby hospital. Chetty said police were still investigating the matter, and no one had been arrested. A case of robbery has been opened, and anyone with information can call police on 08600 10111 or SMS to 32211. &#8211; Caxton News Service For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter .
