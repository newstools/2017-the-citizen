Anthony Delpech looks the jockey to follow at Greyville on Friday night. He has six rides at this seven-race meeting on the Polytrack, four of whom have been priced up favourite, one second favourite and one 7-1 shot. Delpech was off with an injury for around six weeks following a fall at Turffontein but he is certainly making up for lost time and has been in excellent form since coming back to ride. Five of Friday tonight s rides are for the Dean Kannemeyer yard and they have been a deadly combination, especially on the Polytrack. Delpech starts off in Race 2 where he rides Arran Isles in a Maiden Plate over 1400m. This daughter of King s Apostle has raced five times at this course for three seconds and a fourth and in a weak field, should be hard to beat. Her biggest threat looks to come from stablemate Orelia but as Delpech has ridden her in her two starts and has chosen the stable companion indicates this is likely to be the better of the pair. In Race 3 he rides Master Shogun for Alyson Wright in a Maiden Plate over 1600m and this is another who stands out in a weak field. However, one wise bookmaker once told me never to take a short price on a horse just because it is the best horse in a weak field. Take it because it is a good horse, he said. That could be the case in this event. Race 5 is a MR 90 Handicap over 2000m and Delpech rides Mr Winsome for Kannemeyer. This son of Silvano has been priced up 5-2 favourite but on the form his penultimate start the four-year-old gelding could struggle to beat Pure Valor, who is at 9-2. In that race Lowan Denysschen s charge beat Mr Winsome by a short head and is now 1.5kg better off. Delpech s best ride looks to be Night Circus in Race 6, a MR 71 Handicap over 2000m. Blinkers were fitted in his last start and the three-year-old gelding romped to victory over 1600m. He won his maiden over 2000m so the distance is not an issue.
