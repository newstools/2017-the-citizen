Paris, Renewed drilling by US oil producers is keeping a ceiling on a global crude price recovery, cutting into the impact of deep reductions by other major producers, Opec said yesterday. The Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said its members last month reduced output by 890,000 barrels per day according to secondary sources. The International Energy Agency said last week that the initial rate of compliance with a landmark deal to reduce the global oil glut was 90 percent. The deal, agreed last year and in effect since January, called for the Opec cartel and some non-Opec countries to reduce output by about 1.8 million barrels per day (mb/d). (AFP)
