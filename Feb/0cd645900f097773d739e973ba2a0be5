The Proteas have retained the 14-man squad that won the one-day Series against Sri Lanka for the limited overs portion of the upcoming tour of New Zealand. It will consist of one T20 International match and five ODI matches.

Pretorius will miss these two matches to be at home with his wife who is expecting their first child. Paterson made his Proteas debut in the T20 International series against Sri Lanka but has yet to be capped in the 50-over format. Dane will travel with the squad when they leave on Saturday and will return to South Africa once Dwaine joins the squad, said Linda Zondi, the national selection convenor. We, as selectors are very happy with the way the squad has jelled over the past 6 months and consistency in selection is very important as we continue our build-up towards the ICC Champions Trophy tournament. New Zealand are playing very good cricket at the moment and as always will provide very tough opposition, particularly under their home conditions. Zondi confirmed that Lungi Ngidi had not recovered fully from his injury to be considered but that David Miller was fully fit to travel. Proteas ODI squad: AB de Villiers (c), Faf du Plessis, Hashim Amla, Farhaan Behardien, Quinton de Kock, JP Duminy, Imran Tahir, David Miller, Chris Morris, Wayne Parnell, Dane Paterson, Andile Phehlukwayo, Dwaine Pretorius, Kagiso Rabada, Tabraiz Shamsi.
