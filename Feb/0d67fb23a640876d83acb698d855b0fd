Economic Freedom Fighters national spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi has taken to social media to share with us one thing we did not know about him like Minister of Sports and Recreation Fikile Mbalula, he admires Beyonc . Ndlozi retweeted a few articles praising the American musician&#8217;s performance at the Grammys on Sunday and even called her &#8220;the ultimate supreme&#8221;. Among the reactions the tweet received, one follower said he was going to vote for the EFF in the 2019 elections. Despite the two of them being already taken, another follower said Ndlozi and Beyonc would look good together. The People&#8217;s Bae was reminded that he was not alone in the Beyhive, as Mbalula has long declared his admiration for the Pray You Catch Me hit maker. We know EFF leaders do appreciate good music and artistry, but we must admit, none of us saw this one coming. She is the ultimate supreme! #GRAMMYs pic.twitter.com/8FVvzvYrGo &mdash; Mbuyiseni Ndlozi (@MbuyiseniNdlozi) February 13, 2017 &nbsp;
