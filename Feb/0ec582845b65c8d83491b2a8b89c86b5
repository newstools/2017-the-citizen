South Africa has committed to strengthen cooperation with oil-rich Angola in the areas of mining and upstream petroleum, Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane said on Tuesday. This follows a meeting between Zwane and with his Angolan counterpart, Minister of Geology and Mining Francisco Queiroz, on the sidelines of the 2017 Investing in African Mining Indaba in Cape Town. The upstream petroleum sector includes searching for potential underground or underwater crude oil and natural gas fields, drilling exploratory wells, and subsequently drilling and operating the wells that recover and bring the crude oil or raw natural gas to the surface. In a statement, Zwane said the two countries would collaborate on matters of mutual interest, including in the areas of policy, geological mapping, exploration and policy. We must also action the agreements in the African Mining Vision, so that our objective of a prosperous Africa can be realised, Zwane said. Zwane said teams from both countries would meet in the next two weeks to begin implementing the bilateral commitments. Total trade between South Africa and Angola stands at well over R30 billion a year, with Angolan imports into South Africa primarily being petroleum oils, bituminous minerals and crude.
