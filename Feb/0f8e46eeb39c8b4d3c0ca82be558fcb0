Andile Phehlukwayo is only 20-years-old and has only 11 One-day International caps to his name. Yet already he&#8217;s relegating a player of AB de Villiers&#8217; calibre to being the junior partner in a batting partnership. And if you don&#8217;t believe it &#8211; the Proteas ODI skipper admitted so himself. Phehlukwayo, like he did in a wonderful debut series against Australia late last year, once again has the local cricket fraternity buzzing.

In a decisive seventh-wicket partnership of 54 off just over 7 overs with his captain, Phehlukwayo wasw truly the big cheese. &#8220;I was giving it my best shot to score a boundary and it was just too tough for me,&#8221; said De Villiers. &#8220;It was just so difficult. My thinking then was to not face any dot balls and make sure I keep rotating the strike. Cricket works that way.&#8221; It also meant De Villiers had to trust his young partner and, to his eternal credit, did so. &#8220;Andile was hitting it pretty sweet,&#8221; said the Proteas captain. &#8220;It was very impressive the way he played. There&#8217;s a lot of talent in that young man. I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing him grow into a really good cricketer.&#8221; Not only was Phehlukwayo&#8217;s sheer calmness impressive but his ability to quickly adapt to a &#8220;strange wicket&#8221;. &#8220;He was one of the few players on the night that could pick up the pace of the wicket and let it come to him,&#8221; said De Villiers. &#8220;Andile played the ball really well under his eyes.&#8221; Despite gaining a 12th consecutive victory in the format &#8211; a South African record &#8211; the Proteas clearly weren&#8217;t impressed with the conditions. &#8220;Experience-wise it was 10 out of 10 to be put under pressure like that with the bat in hand. Conditions-wise? Zero out of 10. I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re going to face any conditions like that in the UK,&#8221; said De Villiers. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t see the ball turn that much when we bowled. Not for a second were we in control. Our two openers gave us a really good foundation, but I felt they were the toughest conditions I&#8217;ve ever played in.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
