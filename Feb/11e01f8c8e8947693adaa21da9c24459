 Police are on the hunt for a suspect who was recently caught on camera robbing the Engen garage on Commissioner Street in Boksburg CBD, on the East Rand. In the video, a white BMW can be seen pulling up next to one of the petrol pumps, and the driver appears to be instructing the petrol attendant to fill up the tank, Boksburg Advertiser reported. The man is then seen alighting from the BMW and proceeding to the store, where he is seen confronting the cashier, who is seen standing behind the counter. The suspect flings a plastic bag towards the cashier and pulls out a gun while demanding that the cashier put money in the bag. The 31-year-old cashier initially resists, but the gunman threatens him with the firearm and forces him to the ground before going for the till. The gunman is then seen helping himself to the money from the cash register. He then exits the store with the plastic bag containing an undisclosed amount of cash. At the end of the CCTV footage, the robber is seen fleeing the scene in his getaway white BMW. No one was injured during the robbery, and police are investigating a case of business robbery. Investigators are now seeking public assistance in tracking down the suspect, who is described as a white man in his 50s. The robbery took place at night on December 6, but the video was only released this week. Anyone who may have information is asked to contact the investigating officer, Detective Sergeant Azwi Mphaphuli, on 071 422 7417. &#8211; Caxton News Service For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter .
