The man&#8217;s wife has been awarded R50,000 for herself and R15,000 each for their two children. The pair split early last year after cases of physical abuse were opened at the police station. Their messy separation made headlines until they filed for divorce recently. The wife was also given a once off payment of R75,000 and R25,000 per month for rental fees. The 200,000 also includes medical aid, private school fees, extra mural lessons and school trips. The amount also covers security, household and car insurance. According to Sunday World, the couple cannot be named as they are in the process of finalising the divorce. The man once played for his father&#8217;s club and now works there.
