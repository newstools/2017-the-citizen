It would seem the West Indies have unearthed the biggest cricketer to ever play international cricket. On Monday evening (SA time), a 24-year-old player named Rahkeem Cornwall smashed 59 off 61 balls for a West Indian Cricket President&#8217;s XI against the touring England in a warm-up game. What makes him special is that he&#8217;s 2m tall and weighs an incredible 140kg! No comparison: Rahkeem Cornwall dwarfs teammate Jahmar Hamilton. Photo: Gareth Copley/Getty Images. Such a giant obviously will have some issues with mobility in a reasonably athletic game such as cricket but there&#8217;s actually no doubting his ability. The all-rounder is known as a really useful off-spinner and has taken 125 wickets at an average of 24 in first-class cricket. Cornwall has bowled more overs than any other player in the local four-day competition. Against England, he didn&#8217;t bother running much &#8211; hitting six fours and three sixes, meaning 71% of his runs were scored in boundaries. The West Indian national selectors truly consider him good enough to play international cricket and have developed a fitness plan to unlock his potential. &#8220;We&#8217;re actually putting a programme in place for Rahkeem,&#8221; Courtney Browne, the Windies&#8217; convener of selectors, told Line and Length Network. &#8220;We are looking at the various components of him playing cricket where we are looking at coaches, dieticians, and just getting everybody to come together to help this young player. He s a special talent.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
