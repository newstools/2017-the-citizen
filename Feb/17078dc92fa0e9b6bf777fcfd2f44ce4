Preshalin Naidoo, the man accused of two counts of culpable homicide, will not be testifying in his own defence case, reports the Randburg Sun. The state closed their case involving the tragic deaths of Top Billing presenter Simba Mhere and his friend, Kady-Shay O Bryan, on February 8. Both were killed in an accident on January 31, 2015, when Naidoo s VW Polo GTI crashed into their vehicle on William Nicol Drive in Bryanston, Johannesburg. On the same day, defence advocate Francois Roets applied for a postponement of the trial until February 9. This was to allow their accident reconstruction expert enough time to complete his comprehensive report. State prosecutor MJ De Jager agreed to have the case postponed but first asked if the accused would be testifying. Roets told the court that Naidoo would not be testifying in the trial. Roets handed in an application for the accused to be acquitted under Section 174 of the Criminal Procedure Act whereby the court may find the accused not guilty if there is not enough evidence. The court rejected the application. ALSO READ: Two years since Simba and Kady died: What we know now This is an ongoing case.
