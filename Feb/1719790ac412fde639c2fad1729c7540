by Martyn WOOD Bafetimbi Gomis headed his 14th goal of the season to hand Marseille a first-half lead before Payet&#8217;s deflected 76th-minute free-kick secured the points at the Stade Velodrome. &#8220;Payet was decisive, he proved he&#8217;s getting stronger,&#8221; said Marseille coach Rudi Garcia. &#8220;He needs to find his rhythm and nothing is better for that than starting a match.&#8221; Earlier, Wylan Cyprien&#8217;s scorching strike kept Nice within three points of leaders Monaco following their 1-0 victory over Saint-Etienne. Cyprien rifled in the only goal after just seven minutes at the Allianz Riviera as Nice bounced back from Saturday&#8217;s heavy defeat at Cote d&#8217;Azur and title rivals Monaco. Nice moved back level on points with second-placed Paris Saint-Germain after just a second win in six league matches. &#8220;We produced a good first half. We scored a very good goal and had some good chances after that,&#8221; said Nice boss Lucien Favre. &#8220;It&#8217;s a pity we couldn&#8217;t get that second goal because it was a long match afterwards.&#8221; Alexandre Lacazette scored his 19th goal of the season as Lyon produced an encouraging response in the wake of last weekend&#8217;s damaging Rhone derby defeat to thrash Nancy 4-0. Mathieu Valbuena curled in a superb 39th-minute opener with his final touch before hobbling off injured at Parc OL, while Nabil Fekir grabbed a second before half-time. Lacazette then struck from the penalty spot after substitute Memphis Depay was fouled in the area, with the ex-Manchester United winger netting his first goal for his new club to cap the rout. &#8220;The result does us good because we needed to get a win after three straight losses. We still have a long way to go, though,&#8221; said Lyon coach Bruno Genesio, as the home fans held up a series of banners venting their unhappiness at recent performances. &#8220;I completely understand the dissatisfaction of our supporters because we haven&#8217;t done everything since the start of the season to make them happy like they deserve,&#8221; he added. On Tuesday, first-half goals from Kamil Glik and Kylian Mbappe ensured Monaco remained top of the table after a hard-fought 2-1 win at Montpellier. Paris Saint-Germain needed an injury-time winner from Brazilian Lucas to secure a 2-1 victory over Lille after a goalkeeping blunder from Alphonse Areola allowed Nicolas de Preville to cancel out Edinson Cavani&#8217;s league-leading 23rd goal of the season.
