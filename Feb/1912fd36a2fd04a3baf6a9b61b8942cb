Black First Land First (BLF) Andile Mngxitama has expressed his wishes with regards to how the South African government should be run. He further suggested candidates he thinks are well-suited for different positions. Mngxitama does not seem to think Minister of Finance Pravin Gordhan is a suitable minister to be in charge of the banks. Former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe would make a brilliant finance minister instead, he said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t give a toss if Brian Molefe was from West Indies, the brother is black like 90% of S.A. let&#8217;s be serious please!&#8221; In fact, Mngxitama thinks Molefe should have been appointed already. &#8220;Brian Molefe not yet appointed Minister of Finance? This waiting is killing me. How long must we still wait kanti?&#8221; My dream team: Hlaudi as Miniser of land. Brian as Miniser of Finance. On mineral and energy Mosebenzi he must just put more petrol! Lets go &mdash; andile (@Mngxitama) February 18, 2017 Molefe is a &#8220;patriotic&#8221; black manager who has earned the BLF leader&#8217;s respect. Mngxitama further slammed Sunday papers that put the &#8220;Mokonyane Ben 10&#8221; story as a front page story, and attacked Molefe instead of exposing the corruption done by the banks. &#8220;Not one of the major papers call the bank corruption by its name. @SundayIndy chose to attack Brian Molefe on its front page,&#8221; he said. Mngxitama&#8217;s dream team includes Molefe as finance minister and former SABC COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng as &#8220;Minister of Land&#8221;. &#8220;On mineral and energy Mosebenzi [Zwane] must just put more petrol! Let&#8217;s go,&#8221; he said. The former Eskom CEO will be sworn in as an ANC MP in the North West in a move that has been criticised by many and welcomed by parliament. &#8220;Parliament wishes to acknowledge the nomination of Mr Brian Molefe, to fill a vacancy on the North West list of ANC Members of Parliament, which is depleted. Presiding Officers of Parliament will determine a date for swearing him in as a Member of Parliament,&#8221; parliament said in a statement. However, The Federation of Unions of South Africa (Fedusa) seems to think Molefe&#8217;s appointment will strengthen state capture efforts, and will eventually see him being appointed as the finance minister or the deputy.
