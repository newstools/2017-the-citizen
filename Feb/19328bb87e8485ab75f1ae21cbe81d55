After much speculation and concerns over a looming Cabinet reshuffle by President Jacob Zuma, on Tuesday he dismissed reports that he might shake up his Cabinet to remove his detractors from government. Addressing the rumours at a luncheon at Grand West Casino where he met with business and labour leaders in Cape Town, Zuma said he doesn t know anything about plans to change his executive team. I don t know. Since last year, this speculation has been there but it has never happened. Just forget about it. I will tell you when I want to tell you, he said. At the meeting with captains of industry, Zuma called for the country s transformation policies to be streamlined, saying the majority of black people still remained outside the formal economy. He also called on business leaders to work with government to achieve inclusive growth through the mainstreaming of the country s economic policies. Zuma will deliver his Sona on Thursday night.
