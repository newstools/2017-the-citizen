Lacazette has scored 18 goals in just 17 appearances for Lyon in Ligue 1 this season but his future with the seven-time French champions has long been the subject of speculation. &#8220;I think the right time has arrived. I think this summer is the time to change the air and see something else,&#8221; Lacazette, 25, said in an interview broadcast on Canal Plus. Last month Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas spoke of receiving offers of up to 70 million euros ($75.6 million) for the striker during the January transfer window. Lacazette, voted the French league&#8217;s player of the season in 2014-15, confirmed Barcelona had enquired about him last year. &#8220;But that ended because it was not consistent with what I wanted, because what I wanted is to play,&#8221; he added.
