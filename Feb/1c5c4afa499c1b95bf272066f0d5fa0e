The 16th Metro FM Awards left many artists and fans unhappy with the results. It all began with Riky Rick, who said he was not happy with winning his award because there were talented artists who, while struggling, submitted their music to radio stations but never got airplay. STOP PLAYING WITH THE PEOPLE&#8230; WE NOT STUPID&#8230; &mdash; #STAYSHINING (@rikyrickworld) February 25, 2017 &#8220;If niggaz can pay for these f***ing awards, then my nigga, I don&#8217;t want them,&#8221; he later tweeted. DJ Black Coffee also took to social media to share his discontentment with the awards, asking why his remix did not make the cut even though it was played worldwide. Just watched the #MMA16&#8230;.maybe it&#39;s time @METROFMSA do what they do best and remain a Radio Station? &mdash; #PIECESOFME (@RealBlackCoffee) February 26, 2017 Kwesta released one of the most-celebrated songs in 2016, Ngud, and left many hoping he would take Song of the Year. Instead, the award went to Nasty c for Hell Naw, and fans were not happy. Even model Ntando Duma thought Ngud would take the award. Kwesta also took to social media to share his thoughts, saying &#8220;the bullsh*t must be called&#8221;. Never been a bitter fella. We keep working, we just about music. But in the end the bullshit must be called. Just got 4 missed calls from me &mdash; WatchNgiyazfelaNgawe (@KwestaDaKAR) February 25, 2017 Rapper L-Tido said the music industry was &#8220;corrupt&#8221; after Babes Wodumo and Kwesta failed to take home awards. Babes wodumo and Kwesta killed through out 2016 it&#39;s really sad they didn&#39;t win nothing .

Honestly guys, awards stopped mattering to me in 2011 &mdash; jr (@JRafrika) February 25, 2017 Khuli Chana, who most think should have taken Best Music Video, said the power of the people was stronger than the people in power. &#8220;Fuck em,&#8221; he said, responding to a fan who was also unhappy about the outcome of the awards.

He tweeted them, saying they had won the hearts of South Africans, which was the biggest award. Awards are nothing bt pure acknowledgement they don&#39;t determine ur talent, Congrats to all the winners #MMA16 &mdash; Zakhele Madida (@ZakesBantwiniSA) February 25, 2017 The Metros also received criticism from politicians, who accused Mabala Noise of corrupting the event.
