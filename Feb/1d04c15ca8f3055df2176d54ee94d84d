The assessment report declared that he was fit to stand trial and he was capable of understanding court proceedings. The report further stated that he did not suffer any mental disorder when he allegedly killed his mother. The family insisted that he was not in his right mind when he allegedly killed his mother. The defence disputed the report and wanted him to be re-admitted at Weskoppies for a computed tomography (CAT scan) of his brain and an electroencephalogram (EEG) to be conducted. The court dismissed his application to be re-admitted at Weskoppies. Zinde is also facing another charge of assault with the intention to cause grievous bodily harm at the Vereeniging Magistrates&#8217; Court. He was arrested in November last year, for allegedly attacking his father Dr Lebohang Manoto, at his Walkerville home, south of Johannesburg.
