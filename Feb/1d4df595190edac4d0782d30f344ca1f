So desperate was Pastor Mboro to help an ailing Lundi that he offered to put up a deposit at a private medical facility, but his offer was never taken up by the late gospel star&#8217;s manager, he said. Tyamara died last week Friday, and his memorial service was held during the week at Grace Bible Church. Before he succumbed to his illness, Mboro told Tshisa Live he was willing to cough up thousands to have Tyamara accommodated in a private facility where he was likely to get better treatment. Tyamara passed away in the ICU at Edenvale Hospital. &#8220;I visited Lundi at the hospital, and I spoke to his manager, Anele Hlazo, telling him that I would put down a deposit of R100 000 at a private hospital, and Anele said he would consult with the family and get back to me. I then phoned him a number of times, and he never gave me the go-ahead, Mboro told Drum in an interview.
