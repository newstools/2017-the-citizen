Sun International said on Wednesday it had brought forward the appointment of Anthony Leeming as its new chief executive. After discussions with Leeming and the outgoing chief executive Graeme Stephens, the company said it had been decided to make the appointment effective as of Wednesday. Sun International announced on November 4 last year that Leeming, the chief financial officer, would replace Stephens, who was leaving to pursue another opportunity , on May 1. The company said it had since been agreed to bring forward the transition for the sake of continuity and considering the short to medium-term strategic objectives of the company. Noting that the board thanked Stephens for his significant contribution to the group, the statement added that he would stay on with the company until his departure at the end of April and would continue to work closely with the new chief executive in helping to develop and implement the group s strategy . A search is under way for a new chief financial officer to succeed Leeming.
