Dar es Salaam. Promising lightweight boxer Mohamed Matumla Jr, who sustained a head injury during his fight against Mfaume Mfaume on Sunday night, has undergone an operation to remove a blood clot on his brain.Matumla fell into a coma after he was knocked out by Mfaume in the seventh round during their national lightweight fight at the National Indoor Stadium.Tanzania Professional Boxing Commission (TPBC) chairman Chaurembo Palasa said yesterday that, after falling unconscious, the boxer was taken to Muhimbili Orthopedic Institute (MOI), where he underwent a computerised tomography (CT) scan.According to Palasa, CT-Scan revealed that there were signs of internal hemorrhage, which necessitated a 3.35-hour head surgery.Mohamed, whose father (Rashid Matumla) was one of the best boxers during his hey-day, hit the canvas twice during the fight before falling into a coma.In the first round, both Matumla and Mfaume displayed impressive boxing skills, each seeking to register a Knock Out, but the latter seemed to have an edge over his opponent.A few seconds into the fourth round, Matumla was forced to hit the canvas following a combination of heavy head punches from Mfaume, who named the TPBC national lightweight champion.Matumla managed to beat the 10 mandatory counts and continued with the fight.He briefly took the fight to his opponent early in the fifth round before he was sent into the floor again in the seventh round. This time, Matumla did not wake up even after the referee counted up to 10 as per rules and regulations governing the sport. He was unconscious and the doctor urged us to rush him to the hospital, said Palasa. After learning that he was experienced dizziness, doctors decided to conduct a CT- scan, he said.For his part, the bout promoter, Sadick Kinyogoli said doctors told them that after the surgery, the boxer would be admitted to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for at least three days. It was a tough fight and each boxer was targeting the national honour, said Kinyogoli.
