The new mom doted on her bundle of joy when she shared a pic of him on her Instagram account, revealing that she and Zakes don&#8217;t celebrate Valentines day. &#8220;What love looks like &#x1f60d;..

There are no words to explain the love mommy (mommy&#8217;s joy) and daddy (daddy&#8217;s boy) have for you and equally for one another.
