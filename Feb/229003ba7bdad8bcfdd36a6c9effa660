Despite romping to a 159-run victory in the third One-day International against New Zealand in Wellington on Saturday, South Africa will not have any mental edge over their hosts in the next match according to Proteas all-rounder Wayne Parnell. The Proteas claimed a 2-1 lead in the five-match series with their win, and will next head to Hamilton for the fourth ODI where they have the chance to wrap up the series with a match to spare. Though the result would be nothing short of deflating for the Kiwis, Parnell said there would be no concerns about their competitiveness in Hamilton. I don t think you can read too much into it [the result in the third ODI] said Parnell. It will be a different surface; it s zero for zero. We expect New Zealand to bounce back in Hamilton it will be a completely different match. Parnell provided good support batting way down the order at number eight in the third ODI as he made 35 from 32 balls to help South Africa post 271/8. It was with the ball, however, where he shone by claiming 2/33 in eight overs as New Zealand crashed to 112 all out in 32.2 overs. The left-armer said he put the team performances and results first over individual goals. The makeup of the team could change each game he explained. We ve seen that whoever has come in has done what s required Parnell told reporters in Wellington. It s about replicating that game-by-game. You don t always get it right I got a duck in the last game but those things happen. It s about trying to contribute. If I sit out the next game and a new guy comes I m sure he ll do well. It s also about getting combinations for certain conditions so if we have five or six guys bowling well we can rotate depending on if you need a second spinner or an extra fast bowler. We can chop and change without affecting the quality of the bowling line-up. For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
