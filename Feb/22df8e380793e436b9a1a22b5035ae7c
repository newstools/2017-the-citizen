The North West province must have a medical school, premier Supra Mahumapelo said on Friday. He said following an intensive consultation with stakeholders in the health and education sectors, an agreement that the North West Province must have a medical school has been reached. The medical school would be established through the North West University, it was expected that the medical school would attract medical specialists from international countries to the province. We managed to recruit 54 specialists from Cuba and Iran, who are employed on a three year renewable contract, he said during the State of the Province Address in Taung. He said the province would continue to use the national inter-country agreement with countries like Cuba, Tunisia and Iran, to facilitate the recruitment of specialists, while the province was busy with logistics to set up the medical school, Mahumapelo said in a bid to improve access to health care services, a total of 47 clinics were now operating 24 hours a day. For some of our health facilities that are not providing 24/7 hours service, we have strengthened our doctors outreach teams coverage and maternity services for pregnant women, he said. We will be deploying an integrated public health care mobile service to treat, diagnose and promote health in the rural areas.
