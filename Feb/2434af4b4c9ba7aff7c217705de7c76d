Following the deaths of gospel legends Sfiso Ncwane and Lundi Tyamara, some people have apparently been saying the gospel music industry is cursed. After Tyamara&#8217;s funeral, a journalist asked gospel legend Rebecca Malope why she thought this was happening. In a video that has been circulating on social media, it was as if Malope was given a pulpit to preach. She looked at the journalist and said: &#8220;It&#8217;s not a curse, it&#8217;s just a test. Hallelujah!&#8221; She then took a step back and repeated: &#8220;It&#8217;s not a curse, it&#8217;s a test.&#8221; So to those who thought the gospel music industry was cursed, now you really know what&#8217;s happening.
