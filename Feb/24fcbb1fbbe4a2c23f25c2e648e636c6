The National Education, Health and Allied Workers Union (Nehawu) on Wednesday warned the ruling party that if workers were ignored, the African National Congress could find itself facing a backlash in the 2019 general election. The warning was made following the march of about 1000 Nehawu members, who marched on the KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Treasury in Pietermaritzburg to demand better conditions. What we are saying is that if our demands for better wages and working conditions are not met by the employer, then this government will feel the wrath of workers in 2019, Nehawu national deputy secretary Zola Saphetha said. Saphetha said that the march was part of a nationwide campaign in which Nehawu was calling for better working conditions, including the scrapping of the use of labour brokers, an improved package deal which includes an allowance for workers who operate under difficult conditions. He said the march which coincided with the delivery of the national budget was not aimed at Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan, but was meant to highlight workers plight. A memorandum was handed over to Simiso Magagula, the head of the KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Treasury. African News Agency For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
