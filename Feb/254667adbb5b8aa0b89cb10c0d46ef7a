Black Twitter&#8217;s days are over now it&#8217;s time for Male Twitter, according to Deputy Minister in the Presidency Buti Manamela, who this weekend produced a tweet that left some men upset. The deputy minister took to Twitter to ask a simple question: &#8220;What kind of a man are you who cannot cook?&#8221; What kind of man are man are you who can&#39;t cook?! &mdash; Buti Manamela (@ButiManamela) February 4, 2017 Here are some of the responses he got: &#8220;The kind of man that paid lobola&#8221; a response the minister said was an excuse, as he had also paid lobola, yet he cooked for his wife. &#8220;Real man, not gay, no offence to gays.&#8221; Manamela told the follower he had already offended them. &#8220;I know so many real men, gay or not, who cook the best meals. Got nothing to do with your sexuality,&#8221; he said, further asking if the follower thought Somizi cooked because he was gay. &#8220;I can&#8217;t cook umfazi ekhona (when the woman is there). Never.&#8221; &#8220;Different choices for different folks. I don&#8217;t cook because I have a wife.&#8221; While some said they did not cook because it was a woman&#8217;s job, some told Manamela to &#8220;just cook and shut up&#8221;. The minister said his question was simply meant to expose the chauvinism and patriarchy that still plays out in society today. &#8220;It&#8217;s the idea that men can&#8217;t cook because they have wives, sisters or mothers that&#8217;s scary and used as an excuse,&#8221; he wrote.
