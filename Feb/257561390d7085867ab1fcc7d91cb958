Researchers have finally answered the question of whether sex counts as exercise. There is an online calculator that can help you find out just how many calories you have been burning during every session this whole time. The calculator requires that you fill in your weight, gender and the amount of time you think you spend in bed. It will then tell you how many calories you&#8217;ve burnt, along with the weight you&#8217;ve lost. It further tells you the amount of time you&#8217;ll need to spend walking, running and lifting weights to achieve the equivalent of what you achieved during sex. Based on the numbers this calculator has given us, people could literally survive on sex alone. . But the researchers have warned that the calculator only gives you a rough estimate and the results should not be counted as part of any weight loss or fitness plan. Calculate how many calories you&#8217;ll burn tonight as you celebrate the day of love. &nbsp;
