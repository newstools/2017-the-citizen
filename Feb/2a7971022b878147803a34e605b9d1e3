Cape Town police have arrested four alleged hijackers, recovered a stolen car and confiscated two illegal firearms, Western Cape police said. Cape Town K9 police officers were patrolling in Old Paarl Road, Brackenfell, on Friday when they were stopped by a member of the public who informed them of a suspicious looking car parked in Old Paarl Road near a bank, Captain FC van Wyk said. The officers called another police vehicle, also with two officers of the Cape Town dog unit, for assistance. They spotted the suspicious car parked where the informer had mentioned. There were four unknown men in the silver Toyota Tazz. When the suspects got out of the vehicle, [the South African Police Service] SAPS members saw a firearm on the floor of the front passenger [side] and another also on the passenger side at the back of [the] vehicle. Both firearms serial numbers were filed off. The officers checked on the Toyota Tazz and it was positively identified as having been hijacked earlier this month in Delft.
