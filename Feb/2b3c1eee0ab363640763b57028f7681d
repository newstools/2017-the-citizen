The Citizen&#8217;s first Springbok XV for the new season has a distinct Stormers flavour to it. And that&#8217;s not surprising given that Robbie Fleck&#8217;s surprisingly well-drilled side played some excellent rugby in a 34-27 win over the Bulls. But there are a few other faces who also impressed. 15 &#8211; Andries Coetzee (Lions) &#8220;Boeboes&#8221;, as he&#8217;s affectionately known as, will never let any side down. He was typically solid in Bloemfontein. 14 &#8211; Cheslin Kolbe (Stormers) Delightful showing from the Capetonians&#8217; pocket-rocket. Shifted without to the wing and finished off his try well. Defensively solid too. &nbsp; 13 &#8211; Damian de Allende (Stormers) It&#8217;s disappointing that a good start to the year will be interrupted by his ankle injury, that will keep him out for 12 weeks. For once, the Bok centre didn&#8217;t just play wrecking ball as he distributed well. 12 &#8211; Rohan Janse van Rensburg (Lions) It&#8217;s still early days but it doesn&#8217;t seem as if the exciting youngster will fall victim to &#8220;second-season syndrome&#8221;. 11 &#8211; Raymond Rhule (Cheetahs) His overall improvement in the past year has been dramatic and his work rate has skyrocketed. That&#8217;s important for a modern winger. Ran well with the ball and scored a poacher&#8217;s try. 10 &#8211; Fred Zeilinga (Cheetahs) He&#8217;s not known for doing spectacular things but he managed his backline well. Obviously a superb performance with the boot was notable, though he also showed a willingness to vary his play. 9 &#8211; Piet van Zyl (Bulls) The nippy scrumhalf made a dramatic impact as replacement for his side in the second half at Newlands He beat defenders at will, made 2 clean breaks and even scored a try. Not bad for half an hour of rugby. 8 &#8211; Hanro Liebenberg (Bulls) There were many contenders in this position but Liebenberg shades it because he shone in a losing side. Apart from his two tries, the powerful flanker ran hard and carried the ball well. His tackling was also better than the majority of his teammates. 7 &#8211; Ruan Ackermann (Lions) People can moan about nepotism &#8211; his father is the head coach &#8211; but junior certainty justified his place in the side. Ackermann is a blindside flanker in the classic mould &#8211; a powerful ball-carrier, good distributor and X-rated attacking instincts. 6 &#8211; Siya Kolisi (Stormers) He played in the No 7 jersey but deserved to be in this team. Barnstorming start to his captaincy, a responsibility he seems to enjoy. 5 &#8211; Pieter-Steph du Toit (Stormers) What a dynamic player. He&#8217;s an organiser in the line-out, a bulldozer with ball in hand and tackles hard &#8211; though he missed a few later on. 4 &#8211; Eben Etzebeth (Stormers) As always, the proverbial enforcer. He combines superbly with Du Toit. 3 &#8211; Ruan Dreyer (Lions) Definitely had the upper hand when scrumming and is a surprisingly effective tackler. He can work on his discipline though, as five penalties conceded illustrates. 2 &#8211; Malcolm Marx (Lions) The powerhouse hooker showed all his running qualities as an &#8220;extra&#8221; flanker but the most pleasing aspect of his showing is that he worked on his basics. He can actually now throw accurately into a line-out. 1 &#8211; Beast Mtawarira (Sharks) There&#8217;s some life in the Springbok veteran yet. Local player of the round: Rohan Janse van Rensburg If there s one player that stood between winning and losing for the Lions in Bloemfontein, it was this young burly Springbok midfielder. His brace of tries underlined his match-winning abilities with the winner being scored just four minutes from time, where he produced brilliant support play and nifty handling.
