Dodoma. The National Housing Corporation (NHC) in Dodoma Region has acquired land in Chemba, Bahi and Chamwino districts for construction of housing units.This was revealed in an exclusive interview with The Citizen yesterday by NHC s regional manager Joseph John.He said the Corporation plans to construct many low cost houses in all districts in the region so as to assure the government that modern houses and offices are there for occupation. In Chamwino District, we have acquired 7 hectares, in Chemba 3.5 hectares and Bahi 4.5 hectares. But this is just a beginning, later on we ll acquire more land depending on the demand, he said.Presently, he added, NHC owns at least 290 housing units in different parts of the region. Mr John said most of the houses have been leased to both public and private institutions. Out of the number, 33 houses are used for commercial purposes while the remaining 257 are used for residential purposes, he detailed.However, NHC is currently implementing a major housing project that will see construction of at least 300 new houses in the new capital during its first phase.The timely project, dubbed Iyumbu Satellite City Project, commenced in December at Iyumbu, some 12 kilometres from Dodoma Town. In it, there will be modern houses, offices, shopping malls, and many places for other basic social services. As the government is currently relocating to Dodoma there will be a huge demand for residences for civil servants, and traders. Therefore, we saw the need for implementation of this project in order to overcome the anticipated challenge, he detailed.
