In an effort to prove she just really likes black culture and identifies with it, Anita Ronge, a DJ who goes by the name Kasi Mlungu has said her love of house music wasn&#8217;t anything to be defended. She added that she had even dated a black guy, somewhat proving that she doesn&#8217;t really see skin colour. &#8220;My school was 98% white and you can imagine the kind of hate I got mainly from white people. I was called names such as KFC (K***** F***ing Chick). They said I was downgrading. I didn&#8217;t care. I was happy with who I am. I still don&#8217;t give a s*** about what people have to say about me,&#8221; said DuchAz, who is open about her love for the ANC, according to Sowetan Live.
