Former Reserve Bank governor Tito Mboweni has come out to call for Orlando Pirates to be banned from the Premier Soccer League (PSL) for two seasons, but his suggestion may prove to be unpopular if initial responses are a gauge. This after the team&#8217;s fans went berserk and vandalised stadium property during the team&#8217;s match against Abafana be Style, Sundowns, on Saturday at the Loftus Versfeld Stadium. The fans were not happy their team was losing six-nil to the Brazilians. The match had to be stopped in the 82nd minute as players and technical staff ran for cover towards the tunnel. However, match officials resumed the game after it took nearly an hour to restore calm. This did not sit well with Mboweni, who suggested that the Sea Robbers be banned for two seasons from the PSL. &#8220;Why complicate matters folks. Simple. Orlando Pirates must be banned from the PSL for two seasons. Period. There has to be a consequence,&#8221; said Mboweni. EFF leader and Pirates supporter Julius Malema responded: &#8220;Order my governor, with due respect I submit.&#8221; Meanwhile, the Buccaneers&#8217; chairman, Irvin Khoza, condemned the acts of the fans, calling it hooliganism. &#8220;Violence is not the answer, violence diminishes the reasons, no matter how good they are. Now we are talking about violence and not the reasons why you stood up from your seat,&#8221; Khoza said at a press conference at the Rand Stadium. &#8220;Whether it be out of frustration, resignation or legitimate protest; once it becomes violent all the reasons diminish even if they are good or legitimate. &#8220;Violence in sport, especially football, has got a name around the world. It is called hooliganism. When you participate in violence in sport, you&#8217;re a hooligan.&#8221; Tito Mboweni has called for Orlando Pirates to be banned from the PSL for two seasons.I agree. We can t allow hooliganism on the field of playNo. The team should not be held responsible for its fans actionsPirates must just be banned from the PSL. Period! But for losing 6-0 to Downs!Hands off Amabakabaka! Who s Tito Mboweni anyway? Khoza also announced that the club would announce a new coach on Monday.
