Despite sealing the one-day series against Sri Lanka early, there&#8217;s a very good reason for the Proteas to target a whitewash. Winning the series 5-0 would mean Russell Domingo&#8217;s troops would move to No 1 in the official world rankings. Currently, South Africa are equal on points with Australia, who remain first because they haven&#8217;t been surpassed in terms of rankings points.

(Tuesday) is the most important game for us but we&#8217;ve always had one eye on a whitewash,&#8221; said middle-order stalwart JP Duminy. &#8220;It&#8217;s always a nice thing to be ranked No.1 and that will be an added bonus for us. But for now it&#8217;s about making sure we focus on what&#8217;s important for us and that is the preparation leading up to the Champions Trophy in mid-year.&#8221; Last year&#8217;s 5-0 thrashing of Australia seems to have cultivated a new sense of ruthlessness in the Proteas side. Even in the buildup to last weekend&#8217;s &#8220;pink&#8221; ODI, captain AB de Villiers mentioned why it&#8217;s important for them to shut out the Islanders. &#8220;In the past, we&#8217;ve won series early and then slacked off,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The days where 3-2 series wins before a major world tournament is good enough are over. You need to go into a tournament with the most momentum as possible.&#8221; Of course, critics are complaining about the lack of competition Sri Lanka are giving South Africa in this series. As a result, some are wondering about the point of it all. But Duminy is confident that will change with the International Cricket Council&#8217;s proposal for an ODI league, that will give more meaning to ODIs. &#8220;The best way to answer that is something that Russell Domingo harps on quite a lot,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Every game that you play for your country is of importance. If the new system is in place, that puts a lot more emphasis on that. If we are focusing on that, that means we are giving our best throughout the series and for every game.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
