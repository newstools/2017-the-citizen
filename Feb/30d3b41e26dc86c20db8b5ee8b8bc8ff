Police in Khayelitsha in Cape Town have arrested seven people and confiscated three illegal firearms in three separate incidents, Western Cape police said on Sunday. Two men and a woman were arrested after a house robbery and theft of a motor vehicle in Site B, Khayelitsha, in the early hours of Sunday morning, Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said. According to information, a man was sleeping at his home when there was a knock on the door at about 4.10am. He opened the door and three people entered, threatened him with a firearm, and demanded his car keys. They fled the scene in the car. The car was fitted with a tracking device and police traced it and found it in Goodwood. The three, aged 20, 23, and 30, were arrested. The car was recovered and a revolver and ammunition were confiscated. The suspects faced charges of house robbery and possession of an illegal firearm and ammunition, Rwexana said. In a separate incident at about 8.15pm on Saturday night, police were on crime prevention patrols when they noticed two men starting to run away as they approached. The officers gave chase and arrested one of the men after an illegal 9mm pistol was found in his possession. About an hour later, police followed up on information received about an unlicensed firearm kept at a shop owned by a Somali businessman. Police asked permission to search the shop and found a black plastic bag containing a 9mm pistol and ammunition. Three men, aged between 21 and 33, were arrested and faced a charge of possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition. The seven suspects would appear in the Khayelitsha Magistrate s Court once charged, Rwexana said. African News Agency (ANA)
