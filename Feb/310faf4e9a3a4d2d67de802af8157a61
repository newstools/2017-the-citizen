Lack of sufficient iodized salt in diet offered to school children in the country is contributing to poor academic performance, nutritionists have warned.Tanzania Food Nutrition Center s (TFNC) Nutrition Research Officer, Bernard Makete, told Your Health recently that iodine deficiency is a significant cause of mental developmental problems in children and it has implications on reproductive functions and lowering of IQ levels in school-aged children. Iodized salt contributes a lot in the brain development of a child. In the first 1,000 days between a woman s pregnancy and the child s second birthday, it offers a unique window of opportunity to build healthier and more prosperous future, he said.According to him, statistics show that the use of iodized salt in Mtwara and Lindi Regions for the past six years was below 20 per cent; this indicates that out of 100 households only 10 per cent had used iodized salt.At national level, the use of iodized salt has decreased from 81.7 per cent in 2010 to 64.4 per cent in 2014.This decrease was mainly observed in the mainland where nine regions, in the use of iodized salt, were below 40 per cent ranging from 6.0 per cent in Lindi to 35.3 per cent in Simiyu. Others are Mwara, Ruvuma Singida, Tabora Rukwa, Shimyanga and Geita.Regions that presented use of iodized salt above 90 per cent are Arusha, Dar es Saam, Mbeya, Kigoma and Mwanza.Statistics shows that the use of iodized salt is 70.7 per cent in 2010 to 76.9 per cent in 2014, in Pemba Northern it was ranging from 67.4 per cent to 83. 3 per cent Unguja South.He said that to achieve the use of iodized salt in all regions, the government should ensure that implementation of Tanzania Food Drug Authority salt Act of 2010. The Act was made to provide for iodized salt while, it is useful to make provision for the production, import, supply, sale, distribution of iodized salt in a proper quantity and for mixing iodine with salt in order to prevent and eradicate extensive and serious effects caused to public health from iodine deficiency, he said.So far, World Health Organisation (WHO) has identified iodine deficiency as the most common global cause of preventable loss of intellectual performance.During pregnancy, moderate to severe iodine deficiency can cause an irreversible loss of 10 to 15 IQ points in offspring. Health authorities recommend iodine supplements of 150 micrograms a day for pregnant or breast-feeding women.Iodine Deficiency Disorder (IDD) is one of the biggest worldwide public health problems of today. The effect of this is hidden and profoundly affects the quality of human life.Iodine deficiency in the foods we eat occurs when the soil is poor in the mineral, causing a low concentration in food products and insufficient iodine intake in the population.When iodine requirements are not met, the thyroid may no longer be able to synthesize sufficient amounts of thyroid hormone.The resulting low-level of thyroid hormones in the blood is the principal factor responsible for the series of functional and developmental abnormalities, collectively referred to as IDD.The consequence of iodine deficiency during pregnancy is impaired synthesis of thyroid hormones by the mother and the foetus.An insufficient supply of thyroid hormones to the developing brain may result in mental retardation. Brain damage and irreversible mental retardation are the most important disorders induced by iodine deficiency. Daily consumption of salt fortified with iodine is a proven effective strategy for prevention of IDD.These hormones regulate the metabolic pattern of most cells and play a vital role in the process of early growth and development of most organs, especially the brain.In humans, early development of the brain occurs during foetal and early postnatal life.Inadequate intake of iodine leads to insufficient production of these hormones, which adversely affect the muscle, heart, liver, kidney and the developing brain.IDD are known to be a significant public health problem in 118 countries. At least 1,572 million people worldwide are estimated to be at risk of IDD especially those who live in areas where iodine deficiency is prevalent (total goiter rates above 5 per cent and at least 655 million of these are considered to be affected by goiter).Most of these are in developing countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, but in large parts of Europe are also vulnerable.If pregnant women s diets do not contain adequate iodine, the foetus cannot produce enough thyroxin and foetal growth is retarded. Hypothyroid foetuses often perish in the womb and many infants die within a week of birth, medical sources say.
