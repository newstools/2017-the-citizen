Model Sarah Langa-Mackay has just gone on a Twitter rant about her problem with being racially categorised by people &#8220;who know nothing&#8221; about her. What started off as a conversation about her dislike for the word &#8216;slaying&#8217; somehow turned into a racial debate that landed her on the trends list on Wednesday morning. The model told her followers she hated the &#8216;slaying&#8217; concept, saying it made people believe they had to be better than everyone else, even if it meant bringing people down &#8220;to feel worthy&#8221;. &#8220;Who are you slaying against? Life is not a competition, don&#8217;t value yourself against others. Your value should be limitless, not determined by slaying,&#8221; she said. This despite her use of the word last month while showing off her choker necklace, argues Twitter. Don&#39;t be afraid to just SLAY Chocker by @brettrobson #ShopBrettRobson pic.twitter.com/ceRKFuIDEi &mdash; Sarah Langa Mackay (@sarahlanga) January 19, 2017 While some slammed her for &#8220;thinking she&#8217;s better&#8221; and being a &#8220;hypocrite&#8221;, one of her followers commented: &#8220;This might be one of the hetero-whitest things I&#8217;ve ever read.&#8221; The comment left Langa-Mackay upset, saying the follower had absolutely no right to categorise her as a black person when they knew nothing about her. &#8220;I&#8217;m black really?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know where people get the right to be labelling other people black, white or coloured. It&#8217;s none of your business boo! And anyway who cares?&#8221; What she was arguing, according to her, was that there was no category for &#8220;us&#8221;, and she just could not allow people who knew nothing about her race tell her who she was. She further challenged the &#8220;smart&#8221; people to tell her what race she was &#8230; &#8220;or should I host a meet and greet so that you can all stick pencils in my hair?&#8221; Twitter, however, challenged her argument, saying she just had a problem with black people. They dug up her alleged old tweets about black people and asked when she started having a problem with &#8220;being black&#8221;. There is an old tweet complaining about her mom who walks into a shop with a trolley to buy one item. &#8220;I don&#8217;t understand why black people do that *angry*,&#8221; it reads. . In another one, she allegedly wrote: &#8220;Why do us black people like posing next to: tress, cars, poles, statues, escalators, designer stores. Why can&#8217;t it just be us in the photo?&#8221; .
