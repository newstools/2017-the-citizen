A man accused of stabbing to death his mother and twin sister in Lwandle in Cape Town made his third appearance in the Strand District Court on Friday. Vuyo Dondashe, 22, appeared before Magistrate Karen Scheepers, who remanded him to Monday, February 20, when prosecutor Doreen van Zyl is to request the court to refer him for 30 days psychiatric observation. During the period of observation, he will be assessed by a panel of psychiatrists. Dondashe was assessed overnight on Thursday, by a district surgeon, who recommended the 30 days psychiatric observation. Dondashe was arrested last Saturday, by a traffic inspector who found him walking in the street, still carrying the knife he is alleged to have used in the attack.
