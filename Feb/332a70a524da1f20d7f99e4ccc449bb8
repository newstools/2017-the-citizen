by Ian WHITTELL Chelsea negotiated a potentially difficult visit to Turf Moor on Sunday, where Burnley have the third-best home record in the division, behind only Chelsea themselves and Tottenham Hotspur. But despite the solid result, and commanding lead at the top of the table over second-place Tottenham, Conte refused to discuss his team&#8217;s increasingly strong chances of winning the championship. &#8220;That&#8217;s normal. There are 13 games before the end,&#8221; said the Chelsea manager, whose side&#8217;s advantage will be cut to eight points if Manchester City win at Bournemouth on Monday. &#8220;If someone thinks this league is finished, I can tell you now, no. &#8220;There are six teams for me that can win the league and anything can happen. We must continue to work in this way. &#8220;I am happy for the commitment and the will to win. You can only take one point, but I am sure of the commitment. &#8220;We have to think only of ourselves, not the other teams. It is important to play your game, to think about your game and then you think about the other results.&#8221; While Spurs are 10 points back, there are four teams &#8212; Arsenal, Liverpool, City and Manchester United &#8212; within two points of Mauricio Pochettino&#8217;s side and ready to pounce if Chelsea falter. Pedro shot Chelsea into an early lead at Burnley, who were looking for a sixth consecutive top-flight home league victory for the first time in 56 years. But Robbie Brady, the club-record 13 million ($16.2 million, 15.3 million euros) January signing from Norwich City, marked his home debut with a superb free-kick leveller mid-way through the first half. &#8220;I am disappointed because our mentality must be that we have to try always to win and we did this today,&#8221; said Conte. &#8220;But sometimes you must understand that there are tough games and this was very tough, but I am pleased we tried to win. &#8220;I am disappointed for the result, not for the commitment and the will to win. I like to always to take three points.&#8221; &#8211; &#8216;Sublime&#8217; Brady &#8211; Conte was also quizzed about comments made by former Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho after his current club Manchester United beat Watford 24 hours earlier. The Portuguese manager made a veiled reference to Chelsea&#8217;s style of play, labelling them &#8220;defensive&#8221;, but Conte laughed off the comments. &#8220;I don&#8217;t like to reply to the other coaches,&#8221; Conte said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t like this. He is joking. I have experience to understand this.&#8221; Burnley manager Sean Dyche was delighted with the attitude his team showed, especially having gone behind to such an early goal from a team who appear destined for the title. &#8220;First of all, they are top-class, not just by the league table,&#8221; said Dyche. &#8220;Pockets of their play are excellent and you can use it as a guideline to see we have moved forward. &#8220;The team looks more assured. You are playing against the top end of the market. The mentality as well, we have plenty of that glue to hold a team together.&#8221; Dyche paid tribute to Brady, who also scored against Conte the last time he faced the Chelsea manager, when he was playing for Ireland against Conte&#8217;s Italy at last year&#8217;s European Championship in France. &#8220;It was a sublime free-kick against a top-class goalkeeper, a giant of a man,&#8221; said Dyche in reference to Chelsea number one Thibaut Courtois. &#8220;To find that area of the goal was fantastic. To get put into that game was not easy for him. &#8220;He&#8217;s just signed for a new club, he&#8217;s getting a feel for how the team works, but he held his own in a really tough game.&#8221;
