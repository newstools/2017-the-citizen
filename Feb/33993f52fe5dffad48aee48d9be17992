Over the years, we&#8217;ve often heard the excuse from weary motorists arriving back at their parking space that they don&#8217;t have any change to give their hopeful car guard. &#8220;They should take credit cards,&#8221; has been a long-running joke among some of us. Now, though, at least one car guard has made the news for offering exactly that option through the increasingly popular mobile payment app solution Zapper. In Cape Town, some car guards are reportedly using SnapScan. Sabelo Buthelezi told TMG Digital outside his regular spot, Love Coffee on Lillian Ngoyi Road in Durban s Windermere suburb, that he now gets numerous payments through Zapper straight into his personal bank account. The app works by linking directly to people&#8217;s credit, cheque or debit card accounts. Buthelezi has a QR code that any smartphone with a camera can scan and use to transfer money.
