Cricket South Africa (CSA) on Saturday announced the launch of its new franchise-based #T20 Global League. The newly launched tournament will debut in the last quarter of 2017 with eight participating teams. CSA are hoping this new commercial property can be a money-spinner to them like the Indian Premier League (IPL) is to India and the Big Bash to Australia. The announcement of the tender, which is open to foreign companies too, for the new #T20 Global League comes after the CSA president, Chris Nenzani, and chief executive, Haroon Lorgat, informed the ICC and Member nations attending the ICC meetings in Dubai this week. Our vision is to drive the creation of a new #T20 destination league in South Africa that would energise the sport of cricket in South Africa by creating a global platform for the best-in-class to perform and showcase their talent to a global audience, said Nenzani. We have received a very favourable response to our plans from the ICC and Member Boards and look to their support in our endeavour. We now look forward to another exciting chapter in the evolution of South African cricket and to the whole game benefitting from our new #T20 Global League.&#8221; This is a landmark day for Cricket South Africa. Early feedback from the marketplace suggests that there is tremendous interest in our Global Destination League from around the globe, Lorgat said. We have taken our time and worked hard to reach the point where we are now ready to play in the global #T20 arena. This new #T20 Global Destination League offers great opportunities for investment in South Africa and South African cricket, and we are excited by the number of local and international superstars that will feature in the league. We are also confident that the window we have chosen will make it possible franchisees to attract top class players to South Africa.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
