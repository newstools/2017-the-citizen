Richard Murray led a South African podium sweep on Saturday, as local athletes made history at the Discovery Triathlon World Cup race in Cape Town. Murray, the Commonwealth Games bronze medallist, overcame a time penalty for a rule infringement at the final transition, covering the sprint distance (750m swim, 20km cycle ride and 5km run) in 51:33. Despite having to stop for 10 seconds on the run leg after failing to put his cycling helmet in its designated box, he secured a convincing victory in warm conditions. &#8220;Our shoes are usually placed on the left of the box, but this time the shoes were inside the box so I just threw the helmet aside, and I think it was a bit of a fault from the event organisers,&#8221; Murray said. &#8220;I thought I might lose this one due to the penalty, which would have been sad, but I&#8217;m very happy with the way it ended up.&#8221; Olympic bronze medallist Henri Schoeman finished second, eight seconds off the pace, and former world junior champion Wian Sullwald ended third, a further 15 seconds behind. It was the first time SA athletes swept the podium in a World Cup contest, and Schoeman was delighted they were able to do it on home soil. &#8220;The first race of the season is always a bit of a shock to the system, and I felt a bit sluggish in getting the engine started,&#8221; Schoeman said. &#8220;But I&#8217;m happy with my form at this stage and I think South Africa had a great day, so we can all go celebrate now.&#8221; British athlete Lucy Hall won the elite women&#8217;s race in 59:34, outsprinting compatriot Jessica Learmonth by less than a second, with Ai Ueda of Japan taking third place. Anel Radford was the first SA woman across the line, finishing 15th in 1:01:53. For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
