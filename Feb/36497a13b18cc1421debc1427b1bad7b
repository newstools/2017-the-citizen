Despite missing the likes of Louis Meintjes, Daryl Impey and Ashleigh Moolman-Pasio, the second-string SA squad raked in five medals at the week-long event. Smit, a former Under-23 time trial champion at the continental showpiece, edged out Eritrean rider Meron Abraham in a bunch sprint to secure the gold medal and clinch his first African senior crown. Ahmed Amine Galdoune of Morocco grabbed third position. In the elite women&#8217;s road race at the weekend, Charlene Roux was the best of the SA riders, snatching bronze in a closely contested event which was also decided in a group sprint. Aurelie Halbwachs of Mauritius won the race, clinching her 11th career medal at the biennial spectacle, while her compatriot Kim le Court, who won the women&#8217;s title at the AmaShova road race in Durban last year, earned the silver medal. Earlier in the week, Stefan de Bod had taken second place in the elite men&#8217;s time trial, covering the 43km course 26 seconds off the pace of Eritrean winner Meron Teshome. De Bod also bagged gold in the Under-23 division, and was set to pack two medals in his bag before returning home. Juanita Venter, a late replacement in the national team for injured rider Samantha Sanders, took bronze in the women&#8217;s time trial after arriving in Egypt the day before the race. Halbwachs secured victory in the 29km solo contest, 20 seconds clear Eritrea&#8217;s Mossana Debesay, with Venter covering the distance a further seven seconds off the pace
