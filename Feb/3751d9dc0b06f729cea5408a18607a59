Prawns, a Pick 6 carryover and the Prix du Cap will celebrate the end of the Cape Summer Season on Saturday. The annual Prawn Festival always attracts loads of crustacean-munching fans to the racetrack who come to partake in the reasonably priced fare. The Pick 6 carryover is R285,613 and the estimated pool is R1.8 million. The R250,000 Vasco Prix du Cap (Grade 3) over 1400m comprises some of the best fillies in the country and most pundits will be expecting and sees a clash between 2015 Cape Fillies Guineas winner Silver Mountain and last year s champion Just Sensual. Most pundits are expecting the pair to fight it out and that looks likely to happen. Anton Marcus has made the trip to Kenilworth to ride three-year-old Just Sensual and she could well come away with the victory. This daughter of Dynasty is trained by Joey Ramsden and has a lot going for her, other than having Marcus in the irons. She is the best handicapped runner and has the advantage of jumping from No 1 draw. The general consensus is that her last run in the $500,000 CTS 1600 should be ignored as she was drawn wide, forced to go to the front and faded out late behind William Longsword, also owned by Mayfair Speculators and ridden by Marcus. Amazingly Silver Mountain has not been back to the winner s enclosure since winning the Fillies Guineas but she looks ready to capture another race. She was cursed with another bad draw last time in the Grade 1 Klawervlei Majorca Stakes over 1600m and prior to that failed to see out 1800m in the Paddock Stakes. Also Domeyer, who rode her in the Fillies Guineas, is back in the irons and they jump from gate No 8. For those looking to go a bit wider, consider Captain s Flame, Alexis and Goodtime Gal.
