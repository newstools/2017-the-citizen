Last week Rooney said he was staying with Manchester United following persistent speculation he could make a lucrative move to the Chinese Super League. But doubts still surround the long-term club future of the 31-year-old Rooney, the England national side&#8217;s record goal-scorer, and Koeman appears ready to try to bring him back to Liverpool-based Everton. &#8220;I believe that Wayne Rooney is still playing at a high level,&#8221; Koeman told Sky Sports. &#8220;I think he made a good choice to stay at Manchester United and in the Premier League because he has still two or three years in front of him to play on a high level,&#8221; the former Dutch international added. &#8220;What will happen at the end of the season? I don&#8217;t know but in my opinion he is one of the players who can make Everton more stronger. &#8220;It&#8217;s all about what the player likes, what Manchester United needs to do, and we are not involved in that project. &#8220;But every player that we at Everton think can make the team stronger is welcome to Everton.&#8221; &#8211; &#8216;Class apart&#8217; &#8211; Steve Walsh, Everton&#8217;s director of football, endorsed Koeman&#8217;s comments, adding: &#8220;Wayne Rooney is one of the greatest players that has ever played the game in England and for us not to be interested would be wrong. &#8220;He started his career here and if the opportunity arose that he could come back and it sat well with everyone it is something we would consider. &#8220;He is a class apart, he sees things, and all the things that have been said about Wayne are true. He comes into that category of being one of England&#8217;s greatest ever players, so why wouldn&#8217;t we be interested? &#8220;But let&#8217;s not get ahead of ourselves. Wayne is contracted to Manchester United and made a decision to continue to play for them. &#8220;Let&#8217;s wait and see what happens in the future.&#8221; Rooney, born in Liverpool, joined Everton as a nine-year-old and made his senior debut aged 16 on the opening day of the 2002/03 season against Tottenham Hotspur. Six weeks later, Rooney became Everton&#8217;s youngest scorer with two goals against Wrexham in the League Cup. Rooney catapulted to national attention when he scored his first Premier League goal &#8212; a last-minute winner against Arsenal &#8212; five days before his 17th birthday. The 18-year-old Rooney left Everton to join United in a 27 million ($34 million/32 million euros) move in 2004. He has since won five Premier League titles and a Champions League trophy with United and become the club&#8217;s record goal-scorer. Speculation about his Old Trafford future has intensified since Rooney ceased to be a first-team regular under manager Jose Mourinho. That was heightened when he was left on the bench for Sunday&#8217;s League Cup final win against Southampton at Wembley.
