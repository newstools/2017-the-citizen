Dar es Salaam. Azam FC will have yet another reality check this evening when they lock horns with Zambia s Red Arrows in an international friendly match at Chamazi Complex.This will be the second in as many weeks for the former Kagame Cup champions after a scoreless draw with African champions Mamelodi Sundowns of South Africa at the same venue.The Club s information officer, Jafar Idd, said they were not taking the friendly lightly, for it will be a warm-up ahead of the Caf Confederation Cup next month. Mamelodi Sundowns gave us a good experience a fortnight ago and we want to test ourselves against the Zambian giants. These matches are important for the team before we kick off our Confederation Cup campaign, said the spokesman.Azam, who under the tutelage of Romanian Aristica Cioaba, got a bye to the first round where they would play winners of the preliminary round between Mbabane Swallows of Swaziland and Orapa United of Botswana.
