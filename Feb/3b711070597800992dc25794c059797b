New Gauteng health MEC Gwen Ramokgopa says failure to attend antenatal classes during pregnancy has resulted in the high rate of birth complications in the province. This comes hard on the heels of a week-long campaign to educate communities about the dangers of unplanned pregnancies and the risks of being infected with sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV and Aids as part of pregnancy and STI awareness week. Ramokgopa encouraged pregnant mothers to attend antenatal classes during the first 20 weeks of their pregnancy to educate themselves. This will help them to identify pregnancy-related complications and ensure they give birth to healthy children, she said. The department aims to intensify its education programmes on pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. Ramokgopa has called upon pregnant mothers and their partners to visit clinics to learn more. The department wants to remind people that contraceptive services are freely available at all public health institutions. Young people are encouraged to practice the ABC strategy: abstain, be faithful and condomise to avoid unplanned pregnancies and infections. Their aim should be to delay engaging in sexual activities until they are old enough to take full responsibility for their actions, said Ramokgopa. But it was encouraging that 202 528 healthy babies were born in health facilities across the province in the previous financial year, she said. This achievement can be attributed to the department s integrated antenatal care system available to pregnant women. The strategy requires all primary health facilities in the province to provide antenatal care daily to pregnant women and to ensure that no patient is turned back without booking or when the pregnancy is confirmed.
