ATKINSON GRIMSHAW looks as pretty as a picture in the 32Red.com Maiden Stakes at Wolverhampton today, boasting the best form in a very winnable contest. Named after a renowned oil painter who specialised in works that mirrored the tranquil beauty of his home county of Yorkshire, the Andrew Balding- trained colt will attract the attention of the professional bettors in action at Dunstall Park. In two juvenile outings he displayed ability to trouble the judge at Bath and he put in some pleasing work on his trainer s all-weather gallop over the weekend. Oisin Murphy s mount is as fit as he has to be for this first outing of 2017 and will be hard to beat. MISHAAL takes the eye as a speculative Eachway bet in the Betway Handicap in which he faces a number of in-form rivals. Michael Herrington has done well with the seven-year-old who in the past has run well fresh off a break. The race also involves his former stablemate STEELRIVER who is himself on a dangerous mark but has often flattered only to deceive. Mishaal is firing and although the draw has done him no favours still makes Eachway appeal at a double figure price. BRIGADOON deserves a change of luck and that might happen when the veteran contests the Betway App Handicap. Mike Appleby could hardly have his horses in better form, and this consistent dual purpose performer is overdue a win.
