While most of you were sitting in front of your TV screens discussing how corruption has destroyed the ANC, rapper Kiernan &#8216;AKA&#8217; Forbes was busy praising it. In a series of tweets on Thursday night, the rapper slammed the EFF for distracting President Jacob Zuma&#8217;s state of the nation in parliament, saying the party and its &#8220;colonial masters&#8221; had accomplished its mission to disrupt. He was really concerned about &#8220;the sad fact&#8221; that even though the president had important matters to address, everyone was too busy tweeting about security guards instead of listening. Think of corruption as our very own system of wealth redistribution. You put your niggas on, your niggas put THEIR niggas on. Jigga. &mdash; AKA (@akaworldwide) February 9, 2017 Yes, there may have been corruption in the ANC government, but the president had always stood for empowering black people. &#8220;Jacob Zuma has made more black millionaires than any other president,&#8221; he says. Without clarifying on how these millionaires were made, AKA, did, however, explain that corruption and politics went hand in hand. &#8220;Listen here &#8230;. everybody gained from corruption since we gained political power &#8230;. I mean, EVERYBODY. &#8220;Think of corruption as our very own system of wealth redistribution. You put your people on, your people put their people on. Jigga,&#8221; he said. Corruption &amp; politics go hand in hand pah &#8230; just is what it is. GO GET YOURS!!!! Work hard, mind your business &amp; MAKE YOUR MONEY. &mdash; AKA (@akaworldwide) February 9, 2017 He further thanked former president Nelson Mandela and Zuma&#8217;s government for the &#8220;fertile land&#8221; that offered endless opportunities. He said he had &#8220;flourished&#8221;, thanks to Zuma. &#8220;Under Jacob Zuma&#8217;s government I&#8217;ve flourished,&#8221; he said. He did, however, say that he had made more money at Kong than all the money the ruling party has paid him for all his gigs for them combined. Under Jacob Zuma&#39;s government I&#39;ve flourished &#8230;.. the land has been fertile, the opportunities endless &#8230;. VIVA ANC VIVA!!! &mdash; AKA (@akaworldwide) February 9, 2017 Though The World is Yours hit maker praised &#8220;Jacob Zuma&#8217;s government&#8221; for giving people endless opportunities, he further told people to stop slating him, AKA, for his political views and, instead, work on their own dreams and use their given opportunities to better their lives.
