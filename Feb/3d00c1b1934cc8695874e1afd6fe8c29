Democratic Alliance (DA) MP John Steenhuisen says he has noted North West premier Supra Mahumapelo&#8217;s apology for shouting &#8220;fuck you!&#8221; during President Jacob Zuma&#8217;s Sona debate in parliament on Wednesday. However, Steenhuisen feels it is Speaker of the National Assembly Baleka Mbete and chairperson of the NCOP Thandi Modise who should be apologising, further referring to them as &#8220;terrible twins&#8221;. I note apology,it shouldn&#39;t be Supra who is apologizing it should be the terrible twins Mbete &amp; Modise who failed to uphold rules of house! &mdash; John Steenhuisen (@jsteenhuisen) February 16, 2017 According to the DA MP, Modise and Mbete failed to uphold the rules of parliament by not maintaining order. &#8220;One of the Speaker&#8217;s vital functions in the Chair is to maintain order in the House. Usually, where a member has expressed him or herself in a way deemed unacceptable by the Speaker, the relevant member will be instructed to withdraw the expression, and, on compliance, the matter is regarded as settled and should not be referred to again,&#8221; reads the rule Steenhuisen is referring to. &#8220;The presiding officers failed in their duty. They should be apologising for their dereliction of duty and failure to uphold the rules,&#8221; he said. When asked why she did not take action against Mahumapelo, Mbete told MPs in parliament on Tuesday afternoon that she didn&#8217;t hear anyone shouting &#8220;fuck you!&#8221; at Steenhuisen while he had been criticising Zuma and asking for a moment&#8217;s silence for the Esidimeni 94 (though subsequently that number has grown).

Mbete read the letter before members of parliament before the president&#8217;s response to the Sona debate on Thursday.
