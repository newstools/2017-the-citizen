Comedian and The Daily Show host Trevor Noah celebrated his birthday on Monday. If pictures are anything to go by, the 33-year-old had a great time. Noah took to Twitter to thank his fans for the birthday wishes. &#8220;Thank you so much for the birthday wishes everybody,&#8221; he wrote. He shares his birthday with pop singer Rihanna, who turned 29. According to Noah, who is currently in America, the two were planning to have a joint party, however, it seems Rihanna has not yet confirmed. Thank you so much for the birthday wishes everybody. Oh and ps @rihanna let me know if we&#39;re still throwing that joint party! &mdash; Trevor Noah (@Trevornoah) February 20, 2017 While some said the idea of the two partying together was great, some used an old tweet of Noah to convince Rihanna not to party with him. &#8220;Chris Brown&#8217;s FAME album is no#1 on iTunes. Rihanna is cancelling shows due to poor sales. I guess he beat her again,&#8221; he wrote in a tweet dated 2011. But some of his followers pointed out that Noah might not be referring to an ordinary birthday party. They said he might have been talking about a joint (dagga) party. Knowing Trevor Noah, one wouldn&#8217;t put the pun past him. He could be taking jabs at the Kiss It Better hitmaker, who has never been shy about her love for cannabis. &nbsp;
