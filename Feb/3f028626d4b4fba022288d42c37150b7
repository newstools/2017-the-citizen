&nbsp; The Proteas made a mockery of an expected damp pitch by posting an imposing 185/6 in the solitary T20 against New Zealand in Auckland on Friday. Sent in by Black Caps skipper Kane Williamson, South Africa prospered on what seems a surprisingly easy-paced pitch. Also read: Imran Tahir ain&#8217;t too fond of playing just one T20 Hashim Amla rode his luck before playing a typically classy innings. His 43-ball 62, a knock that included nine fours and a six, headlined the visitors&#8217; effort after the immaculate Trent Boult, who finished with 2/8 in his four overs, had them in early trouble. Amla was well-supported by Faf du Plessis (36 off 25) as well as AB de Villiers (26 off 17). That said, it still feels as if De Villiers &#8211; the Proteas&#8217; best batter &#8211; is still due a big score following his recent return from injury. The Proteas ever so slightly lost their way in the latter stages of their innings but JP Duminy provided some impetus with a sprightly 29. Wayne Parnell&#8217;s boundary off the last ball also added some gloss to a fine day with the bat. But will he and his bowling attack mates cope with the smaller boundaries? &nbsp; Proteas: Quinton de Kock, Hashim Amla, Faf du Plessis, AB de Villiers, JP Duminy, Farhaan Behardien, Chris Morris, Wayne Parnell, Andile Phehlukwayo, Imran Tahir, Dane Paterson.
