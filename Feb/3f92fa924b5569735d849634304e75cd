&#8220;I can see just how happy he is at Barcelona with his family around him,&#8221; said Bauza, who has been at the helm of the Argentine national team since August 2016. &#8220;Of course when Leo is happy that helps him give his best performance, morale is crucial for form,&#8221; said the 59-year-old former defender. &#8220;A footballer is happy when he is playing and winning, otherwise he is rarely happy,&#8221; said Bauza. Messi&#8217;s Barcelona were beaten 4-0 at Paris Saint-Germain last week in their first-leg last-16 Champions League tie and with his contract running out in 2018 there is speculation he may leave. The coach refused to be drawn on Messi&#8217;s future. &#8220;At Barcelona, Manchester City or wherever, that&#8217;s his decision to take. I just want him to play and that&#8217;s all.&#8221; &#8220;He&#8217;s the type of player who always wants to be on the pitch, never wants a rest.&#8221; The coach went on to say Messi&#8217;s international record, with the trophy cabinet with Argentina bare, was no stain on his achievements. &#8220;Some say the fact he&#8217;s won nothing with Argentina means he&#8217;s not the best in the world, not the most dangerous, not worth as mush as some others,&#8221; said Bauza. &#8220;But we are going to try and win this next World Cup, which will make him one of the greatest of all time.&#8221; Argentina are currently fifth in the qualifiers for the South American 2018 World Cup qualifying group with four games to go.
