When people ask Dwaine Pretorius what type of all-rounder he is, his answer always stays the same. &#8220;I would love to be seen as a 50/50 all-rounder,&#8221; said the rookie Proteas all-rounder after his heroics with the bat almost carried his country to victory in the 2nd ODI against New Zealand on Wednesday. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to consider myself a batting all-rounder or a bowling all-rounder. I want to contribute equally in both aspects of the game.&#8221; Also read: I m to blame for not seeing us through, says AB de Villiers Cricket fans certainly can&#8217;t deny the 27-year-old Highveld Lions stalwart has added deeds to those words. Pretorius has only played six ODIs to date but has already snapped up 9 wickets, even though he&#8217;s only bowled his full quota of 10 overs once. To add to his developing reputation, he smashed a 27-ball 50 in only his second innings for the Proteas after grabbing 2/40 while bowling. Those stats certainly scream &#8220;50/50&#8221; cricketer. &#8220;I do pride myself a lot on my batting but I have been working a lot on my bowling the past year or so,&#8221; said Pretorius. &#8220;It&#8217;s now just about keeping the standards up with both bat and ball. I want to keep adding value to the team.&#8221; Another strength of Pretorius is his ability to really keep things simple &#8230; and tight. His captain AB de Villiers had admitted the pitch at the Hagley Oval wasn&#8217;t easy to bat on and yet Pretorius hardly seemed to struggle to keep the runs down. &#8220;I just tried to do the basics well with the ball. We immediately saw after Chris Morris&#8217; first two overs that this wasn&#8217;t a pitch where you could give width,&#8221; said Pretorius. &#8220;I tried to let the Black Caps&#8217; batters score to the longer boundary of the ground. It was about bowling wicket-to-wicket, which meant that if there could&#8217;ve been some nip, we could aim for a LBW decision.&#8221; It worked a treat as he trapped opener Dean Brownlie in front. In the end though, it was Pretorius&#8217; cool head under pressure with the bat that stole the show. He admits it&#8217;s easy to perform in the current setup. &#8220;Andile (Phehlukwayo) and I did really well to keep us in the game,&#8221; said Pretorius. &#8220;The thing I&#8217;ve immediately realised in this side is that we don&#8217;t rely on just one or two individuals to perform. We rely on everyone to contribute. That&#8217;s been the key to our winning run.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter. &nbsp;
