Democratic Alliance leader Mmusi Maimane on Thursday pledged that he would approach courts, after the joint sitting of Parliament for President Jacob Zuma s State of the Nation address descended into chaos and fistfights. The Constitution of this Republic makes it clear that the army and the police cannot enter this chamber. Inside there, they pulled teargas, and they protected Jacob Zuma using the military and police. It has become quite clear that Parliament is now a broken institution and that (Speaker) Baleka Mbete is simply there to protect Jacob Zuma, Maimane said, addressingd local and international journalists outside Parliament. We will be in court tomorrow applying for a review application. Let us stand up for the Constitution of the Republic.

There was teargas in the gallery where all our guests were. Teargas was deployed in the gallery of Parliament. This is a serious matter which violates the very essence of our Constitution. It can t be, said Maimane. Maimane then intervened as public order policing members, behind shields, pushed against hordes of news journalists who were interviewing him. Please open the way for the press. We have agreed that the members of the press can go through. Please allow the press to move freely. You don t need to be doing this, Maimane appealed.
