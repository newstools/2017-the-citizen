Loftus Versfeld has been the scene for countless Springbok, Bulls and Northern Transvaal rugby victories over the years. On Friday, the ground provided the backdrop to saying farewell to former Springbok rugby captain Joost van der Westhuizen. The former Springbok scrumhalf, regarded as one of the best No 9s of all time, lost his fight to motor neuron disease on Monday. On Fiday, thousands of fans and friends, including the 1995 World Cup-winning Springbok squad, said goodbye to Van der Westhuizen, who scored 38 tries in 89 Tests. Joost loved winning &#8230; he was the ultra competitor, said Francois Pienaar, captain of the triumphant Springboks in 1995. He always pushed the boundaries. He was an individual spirit who pushed for his team-mates. On the field, he played like a rock star, off the field, he partied like a rock star. After all, he was a rock star. Yes, Van der Westhuizen had his fair share of controversies off the field. But the manner in which he raised awareness for other motor neuron disease sufferers in establishing the J9 foundation is testament to the man he was. His courage and humility will always be remembered. Rest in peace, Joost. For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
