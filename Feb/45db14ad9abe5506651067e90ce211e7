Ntombezinhle &#8216;DJ Zinhle&#8217; Jiyane has been working out, and the results are showing. The yummy mama of one has been posting videos of herself jogging and doing other exercise routines some of us can only admire from a distance, though we still wish for a body like hers. Her fans have also opted to admire from a distance, with one commenting: &#8220;I&#8217;m tired for you, boo,&#8221; on one of her videos. Watch the video below: A video posted by ZINHLE JIYANE (@djzinhle) on Jan 23, 2017 at 10:03pm PST To show the results of her tough exercise routine, one of her fans, Instagram user Prettykamine, has posted a lovely picture of the DJ on the dancefloor, holding her phone. Zinhle is definitely serving us real leg goals, and we&#8217;re jealous, though we still won&#8217;t be doing those exercises (you&#8217;re welcome to try though).
