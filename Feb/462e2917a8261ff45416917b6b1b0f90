Serena Williams isn&#8217;t just winning on the tennis courts of the world. World tennis&#8217; leading woman player is also rocking things off the court. The 35-year-old icon, who recently won the Australian Open and also got engaged to internet entrepeneur Alexis Ohanian, continued to hog the spotlight with a racy swimsuit photoshoot with Sports Illustrated magazine. She&#8217;ll certainly have many women envy with the way she can pull off her curves. Williams gave her legion of fans a few teasers on her Instagram account.
