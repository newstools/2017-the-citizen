Promising middle-distance runner, George Kusche, displayed impressive early-season form on Friday night, clocking the fastest 1 000m time ever run by a junior South African athlete at the third and final leg of the TomTom Classic Shootout Series at the University of Johannesburg. His 2:19.08 performance, achieved on the side lines of a schools meeting, was unlikely to be considered for record purposes due to standard ratification processes, but his time would stand as an unofficial SA under-20 best. Kusche, who reached the semi-final of the men s 800m event at last year s IAAF World under-20 Championships in Bydgoszcz, covered the two-and-a-half lap distance more than a second quicker than Clyde Colenso s national record of 2:20.21 set in Sydney in August 1996. Treasure Derison won the Classic Shootout race, a unique contest which saw simultaneous battles on the inside and outside lanes of the track. He crossed the line in 2:18.85, with Kusche grabbing second spot overall and Nkosinathi Sibiya earning third place in 2:19.36.
