It seems Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) national spokesperson and People&#8217;s Bae Mbuyiseni Ndlozi has found himself a new fan following the party&#8217;s removal from Sona in parliament on Thursday. However, the fan&#8217;s comment on Ndlozi&#8217;s humour suggests he has been listening to a few of the People&#8217;s Bae&#8217;s speeches that have left opposition members angry or blushing. Taking to Twitter recently, user Andrew Worrall asked the party&#8217;s national chairperson Dali Mpofu if &#8220;Ndalozi&#8221; was on Twitter so he could follow him and read more of his jabs. &#8220;Is Ndalozi on Twitter? That guy is hilarious. I want to follow him. Very clever, quick humour with a jab or two,&#8221; said Worrall. . The national chairperson responded to Worrall, mockingly saying he had never heard of the guy. &#8220;Maybe we ask President Mabeki,&#8221; he said, in reference to how many white people commonly mispronounce the former president&#8217;s surname. Ndalozi??&#8230;.Never heard of the guy myself!!&#8230;Maybe we ask President Mabeki??? https://t.co/r6Jnba8vHF &mdash; Dali Mpofu (@AdvDali_Mpofu) February 10, 2017 Some of his followers asked &#8220;Mapofu&#8221; why he had responded like that, while some criticised him for failing to direct a fan to the People&#8217;s Bae. One user responded with Ndlozi&#8217;s Twitter handle to help the poor man out. The mispronunciation of Ndlozi&#8217;s name comes in the wake of political journalist Carien du Plessis&#8217; criticism of President Jacob Zuma s mispronunciation of fallen Bok hero Joost van der Westhuizen s name in parliament on Thursday night. Also read: Good luck, Vusi white DA supporter to Mmusi Maimane During his Sona, the president expressed his condolences at the death of the Bok legend, and he paused briefly before wading in bravely to pronounce the name. It did not go terribly well and sounded something like: Djhooost Fun Die Wooesthooozeen. Du Plessis was not impressed with the president s murder of the name. Taking to Twitter, she said: Zuma murders Joost van der Westhuizen s name by pronunciation expressing condolences. Someone fire the presidential speech writers #SONA2017, after which she received a backlash she had probably not anticipated.
