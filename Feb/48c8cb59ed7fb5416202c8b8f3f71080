Paris. French oil major Total said yesterday it planned to increase its dividend to shareholders as it expressed confidence earnings could withstand the current volatility in oil prices.Total said in a statement that its headline net profit soared 22 per cent to $6.2 billion in 2016.However, the adjusted net profit, which is tracked by analysts because it excludes one-off items, fell by 21 percent to $8.3 billion. Revenues were down nine per cent at $149.7 billion. Oil prices were highly volatile in 2016, fluctuating between $27 per barrel and $58 per barrel, said chief executive Patrick Pouyanne.The average price of oil declined by 17 per cent and the average price of gas by 25 percent, he noted. In this difficult environment, the group demonstrated its resilience by generating adjusted net income of $8.3 billion, Pouyanne said. In this context, the board of directors proposes to increase the dividend, despite the volatility of hydrocarbon prices, to 2.45 per share.This demonstrates the board s confidence in the strength of the group s results and balance sheet as well as its prospects for cash flow growth. In the fourth quarter of 2016 alone, Total said its revenues grew by 12 per cent to $42.3 billion.
