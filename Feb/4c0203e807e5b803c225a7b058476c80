The former Barcelona star signed for Serie A champions Juventus on a free transfer last summer after eight years with the Catalan giants. &#8220;Those who run Barcelona today have no idea how to treat their players,&#8221; Alves told Spanish daily ABC on Monday. &#8220;I like to feel wanted, and if they don&#8217;t want me, I leave. Leaving Barca on a free was a classy punch. During my final three seasons I always heard that Alves was leaving, but the directors never said anything to my face. &#8220;They were very false and ungrateful. They did not respect me. I was only offered a new deal when the FIFA transfer ban came in. &#8220;That was when I played them at their own game and signed a deal with a termination clause.&#8221; Alves said he chose Juventus &#8212; bidding for a record sixth consecutive Serie A title this season &#8212; because he wanted a challenge outside his &#8220;comfort zone at a club with a history and a winning mentality&#8221;. &#8220;Here I&#8217;m happy and I have new and beautiful challenges in this great team. We have a team capable of challenging for the Champions League.&#8221; Alves admitted he sometimes found aspects of fame tiring. &#8220;Football&#8217;s really hypocritical,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That&#8217;s why I am disappointed. Fame is s&#8212;. &#8220;Now that I am famous I&#8217;ve realised that famous people are seen in a poor light. Football brings envy, hypocrisy and false friendships.&#8221; Alves also blamed the media for twisting his words resulting in frequent clashes with Real Madrid striker Cristiano Ronaldo. &#8220;All my fights with Cristiano were because of the press,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If people only knew how much I respect Cristiano Ronaldo. I will repeat it to make myself clear: I respect Cristiano Ronaldo. &#8220;And I think the same of (Lionel) Messi or Neymar. My thoughts were not negative. What happens is that the press sold them differently, saying that I had spoken badly of him. And Ronaldo believed it. &#8220;That&#8217;s why he did not greet me at the Ballon d&#8217;Or Gala in 2015.&#8221;
