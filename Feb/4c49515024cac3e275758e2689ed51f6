Dar es Salaam. The government of Canada has secured Sh860,475,000 ($385,000) cash assistance support to 10,000 refugees living in the country. Canadian High Commissioner to Tanzania Ian Myles said in a statement released yesterday that the refugees would receive cash transfer from the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP). The refugees will be receiving cash in addition to food as part of a three-month pilot programme covering 10,000 refugees, he said.WFP will be providing Sh10,000 ($4.50) twice monthly to each member of households participating in the cash pilot programme.According to the statement, the money will be delivered in form of mobile money during a new programme. The refugees will continue receiving fortified vegetable oil and porridge, while rations of maize meal, pulses and salt will be replaced with cash money.He said providing cash money would allow refugees freedom to choose what to purchase, while also injecting the money into the local economy. The Nyarugusu Common Market, which opened this year in the buffer zone between the camp and the host community, provides traders with space to sell their produce to refugees. Canada is pleased to support WFP s refugee operation in Tanzania, said the Canadian High Commissioner. Combining both food and cash assistance gives women and men greater flexibility in meeting their needs and can also have a positive impact on the host community, he said
