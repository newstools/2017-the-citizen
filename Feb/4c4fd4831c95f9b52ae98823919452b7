Economic Freedom Fighters leader Julius Malema and the party&#8217;s national spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi have taken to social media to criticise the Metro FM Awards that took place at the ICC in Durban on Saturday night. Malema criticised the event that he said was not the right platform to honour legendary musicians Caiphus Semenya and Letta Mbulu, alleging that the awards were corrupted by Mabala Noise. &#8220;We love Caiphus Semenya and Letta Mbulu,we need a proper event to honor them. Not this Mom Rubby&#8217;s shebeen called #MMA16 corrupted by Mabala noise,&#8221; he said. We love Caiphus Semenya&amp;Letta Mbulu,we need a proper event 2 honor them.Not this Mom Rubby&#39;s shebben called #MMA16 corrupted by Mabala noise &mdash; Julius Sello Malema (@Julius_S_Malema) February 25, 2017 Malema&#8217;s comment comes after Mabala Noise artist Riky Rick&#8217;s rant during his acceptance speech in which he called the music that was being played on radio &#8220;crap&#8221;. He further said he was not happy about his award because there were artists who had no money but submitted their music to radio stations, but were, however, not getting airplay. &quot;If niggaz can pay for these fucking awards then my nigga I dont want them&#8230;&quot; &#8211; RIKY RICK 2016 &mdash; #STAYSHINING (@rikyrickworld) February 25, 2017 Was he trying to tell us something about his stable that won big at the awards? His mic was cut off before he could continue with his rant but later he said to Khanyi Mbau and Somizi: &#8220;Stop playing with the people, the people are not stupid.&#8221; STOP PLAYING WITH THE PEOPLE&#8230; WE NOT STUPID&#8230; &mdash; #STAYSHINING (@rikyrickworld) February 25, 2017 He further said he would not continue with what he wanted to say because people did not like to hear the truth. So in short Riky Rick is saying he got the award because Mabala Noise&#39;s money gave to him&#8230; #MMA16 &mdash; Mbuyiseni Ndlozi (@MbuyiseniNdlozi) February 25, 2017 His speech, however, left many wondering if he was talking about his record label that has been in the news for the wrong reasons. They say he should hold a press conference and &#8220;expose&#8221; those who did not want him to be heard. Even Ndlozi questioned Riky Rick&#8217;s speech. &#8220;So in short Riky Rick is saying he got the award because Mabala Noise&#8217;s money gave to him,&#8221; he said on Twitter. The stable celebrated as its newly signed artist Nasty C won four awards including Song of the Year, Best Hip Hop Album, Best Male Album and Best New Artist. During his acceptance speech, Nasty C called his boss, Reggie Nkabinde, who was booed by the crowd after saying Africans should be ashamed for failing to produce artists that are successful around the world. Last year, Malema alleged at a press conference that an amount of R5 million was apparently being paid to Mabala Noise artists, which is owned by Reggie Nkabinde, the national treasurer of the ANC Youth League. This hefty claim was made by a once ANC insider. Malema made further allegations, accusing Nkabinde of using the record label as a front to launder millions he had received in water and sanitation tenders from Nomvula Mokonyane, the former Gauteng premier, now the water and sanitation minister. Mokonyane was also the head of the ANC s election campaign. Nomvula likes them young. All these boys that are working for and with her are young boys, said Malema. He joked that Nkabinde was getting tenders from Mokonyane s department as if water had something to do with music. Mabala Noise was established by Nkabinde and a business partner, DJ Bongz. The duo signed close to 20 artists including rapper Riky Rick, Nasty C, Major League DJs, Khanyi Mbau, Zola and others. &nbsp; A visibly frustrated Malema also alleged that Nkabinde was running a money laundering scheme and had spent R10 million on bringing international star Chris Brown to the country during the Durban July. Mabala Noise is used to steal money. Artists under Mabala Noise received R5 million. Mabala Noise is owned by Youth League TG. They used unconscious rappers who are committed to money. They used artists who are not like Hugh [Masekela] and Ma [Miriam] Makeba. They take celebrities from Reggie s stable and give them R5 million. Money unfortunately plays a big role in [election] campaigns. In a clear reference to the dancing ANC president, Jacob Zuma, and an admission by Mokonyane that the party had spent more than R1 billion on its election campaign, Malema said: People spent a billion on dabbing. But dabbing has fallen, said Malema. &nbsp; Also read: Did Kelly Khumalo forget to wear underwear at the Metros? &nbsp;
