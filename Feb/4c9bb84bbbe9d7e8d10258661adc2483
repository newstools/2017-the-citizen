by Ian WHITTELL A 2-0 fifth round win away to Wolverhampton Wanderers on Saturday took Chelsea through to the quarter-finals of the FA Cup, while they maintain a healthy, eight-point, lead at the top of the Premier League table. That has left Conte s team on course to join Arsenal, one of their London rivals, and Manchester United in winning &#8216;The Double&#8217; for a second time, although the cautious manager refused to take anything for granted. &#8220;I think it s a little early to talk about this,&#8221; Conte said. &#8220;But for sure we are in these two competitions. &#8220;In the league we are doing a great job to stay on top of the table. Now, in the FA Cup, we are in the quarter-finals and I m pleased with this because it means we re doing very well,&#8221; the Italian added. &#8220;We&#8217;re working very well but honestly, after this game it&#8217;s important to understand that nothing is easy,&#8221; explained Conte, who joined Chelsea in pre-season after a stint managing Italy&#8217;s national side. &#8220;If someone thinks that for sure in the league Chelsea will become champions, and for sure we can win the FA Cup, it will be very difficult. &#8220;But we know that. We understand we want to stay there and we want to try to reach the end and win some trophies. &#8220;Because when you stay at a great club then your job is this, to try to fight until the end to try to win some trophies. We&#8217;re in a good position now but we have to work very hard. The biggest crowd at Molineux for 36 years &#8212; 30,193 &#8212; saw Chelsea negotiate the fifth round tie with second-half goals from Pedro and Diego Costa. But the top-flight visitors were forced to battle for the victory and withstand a strong first half performance from a Wolves team that is currently struggling at the wrong end of the second-tier Championship table. &#8211; &#8216;Bow down to Lincoln&#8217; &#8211; Meanwhile Conte also joined football fans all over the country in expressing his admiration for non-league Lincoln City who produced one of the biggest FA Cup upsets of all-time to win 1-0 at Premier League Burnley earlier on Saturday and reach the last eight. &#8220;We must bow down to them,&#8221; said Conte. &#8220;It&#8217;s true this is a great achievement for them and also I think that s the beauty of football. It is the FA Cup, it s incredible. &#8220;In Italy, it s impossible for this to happen. It&#8217;s fantastic because it shows that football is incredible and anything can happen if you trust in your work, if you have a great will to fight and to take on the challenge. &#8220;When you start, the challenge can be impossible but instead, Lincoln are now in the quarter-finals of the FA Cup and deserve a great compliment from me, from Chelsea and from the whole country. &#8220;It s a fantastic story, historic, and I&#8217;m pleased to live this story with them because now we&#8217;re with Lincoln in the quarter-finals of the FA Cup. That&#8217;s fantastic.&#8221; For his part, Wolves manager Paul Lambert insisted that it would be tough for any of Chelsea&#8217;s top-flight rivals to stop them winning both the Premier League and FA Cup this season. &#8220;They re a very, very good team with a top manager who s played the game and knows the emotion on and off the pitch,&#8221; said Lambert. &#8220;I think it will be a hell of a team to stop them. Without a doubt they could win the league and cup double. &#8220;They re relentless. They have so many lads who didn t even play tonight. I looked at the team tonight and thought it might have been a tad weaker, but dear oh dear! It s going to be a hell of a team that stops them from winning both trophies.&#8221;
