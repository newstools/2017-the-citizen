This time, Mamelodi Sundowns didn t need a get out of jail free card to stamp their dominance on African club football after lifting the Caf Super Cup at Loftus Versfeld at the weekend. The Caf Champions League and Absa Premiership titleholders saw off Republic of the Congo giants TP Mazembe 1-0 at the iconic stadium in Pretoria through an 83rd-minute penalty by Ricardo Nascimento after long periods of sustained pressure on the Congolese team three-time Super Cup champions and five-time Champions League titleholders. It was only one of those quirky twists of fate which got Sundowns through after the South African side had been eliminated from Champions League contention, then almost miraculously reinstated by being awarded a walkover victory against AS Vita Club last May, when the Congolese side were disqualified for fielding an unregistered player. Sundowns needed no further encouragement, roaring back and going on the beat Egyptian giants Zamalek 3-1 in the two-legged Champions League final and, now, going one better in the Caf Super Cup. Along with all South Africans, we salute coach Pitso Mosimane, club owner Patrice Motsepe and the players.
