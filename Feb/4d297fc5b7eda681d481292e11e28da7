Kagiso Rabada is a multi-millionaire at 21. It&#8217;s a crazy thought but it&#8217;s a reality. Also read: Kagiso Rabada gets a timely boost as New Zealand beckons The Proteas&#8217; exciting fast bowler on Monday fetched a massive bid of R9.8 million in the 2017 Indian Premier League (IPL) auction. He&#8217;ll play for the Delhi Daredevils in this season&#8217;s campaign and has no reason not to feel loved in the glitzy tournament. Rabada had a base price of R1.96 million &#8211; the minimum amount a team had to bid when his name was put up &#8211; and eventually had Delhi and the Kings XI Punjab fighting for his signature. It will be the brilliant quick&#8217;s, who bowled a good spell in Sunday&#8217;s first ODI against New Zealand, maiden campaign in India.
