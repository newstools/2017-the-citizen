FIFA said its disciplinary committee had &#8220;decided to extend the five-year ban from taking part in any kind of football-related activity&#8221; on Chris Giwa and four others. The ban would apply worldwide, it said in a statement on its website. Giwa, the former owner of Giwa FC in the central city of Jos, has insisted since August 2014 that he was elected as the rightful president of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF). But the result of the ballot was disputed and prompted FIFA to threaten to ban Nigeria from international competition unless the election was re-run. Amaju Pinnick was duly elected as NFF boss but Giwa has since dragged the federation to court to challenge its legitimacy. In May last year the NFF banned him and his supporters for impersonation and breaching FIFA rules by taking football matters to a civil court. The Confederation of African Football (CAF) also confirmed the ban.
