There&#8217;s nothing like a good kick up the backside to get someone going again.

To make that victory even more sweet, they beat the English 29-14 in the final. For Seabelo Senatla, it was the best to way to say &#8220;cheers&#8221; to his teammates as he now links up with the Stormers for the Super Rugby campaign. The Blitzboks&#8217; most valuable player once again shined in the showpiece match to walk away with the Man-of-the-Match award. It was his weaving run in the first half, where he beat numerous defenders, that put South Africa on their way. Senatla was typically humble afterwards. &#8220;It&#8217;s incredible. The guys are just magicians, hats off to them. I&#8217;m just the finisher of the moves,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s bitter sweet, we play here with family so it is a pity to be leaving the family but it s a new challenge I am excited for.&#8221; Yet even if some fans feel jittery about him and Kwagga Smith leaving the roost, they&#8217;ll be encouraged by the contributions of others. Captain Philip Snyman had South Africa on the board after 48 seconds, rounding off a sweeping move on the left touchline. It was also a really good weekend for Justin Geduld, who is clearly relishing the playmaking role in Cecil Afrika&#8217;s absence. He kicked superbly throughout and possess the type of versatility that will make him even more valuable in future. The Blitzboks made sure they wouldn&#8217;t be caught off-guard by England again after a last-gasp try saw the Roses win 21-15 on day one. Their marking was watertight and they bullied the English ball-carriers at the breakdown. &#8220;The team stuck to the structure and well done to them,&#8221; said Snyman. &#8220;It is extra special because it s our first back-to-back win in Australasia. Hats off to all in the system.&#8221; South Africa rocked up well on day two, firstly comfortably disposing of the USA 21-10 in their quarterfinal. They built up further momentum with a fine 26-12 win over Australia, who were prickly and intent on making life difficult for the Blitzboks.
