Following a report by The City Press that deputy minister Mcebisi Jonas allegedly facilitated the flouting of the tender process for a US company to get a tender to provide aircraft components to SAA, the Hawks have responded, saying this was untrue. According to Eyewitness News, Hangwani Mulaudzi of the Hawks said Jonas was not implicated as yet. There s an investigation that involves billions of rand at SAA and that investigation will only be determined as to who is involved once we continue with it. But to say that the deputy minister of finance or anybody is attached to it, I think, is unethical and wrong. City Press quoted senior Hawks sources who said SAA chairperson Dudu Myeni was also contacted for the investigation and that Jonas would be approached to give a statement soon. Jonas is said to be a target of a campaign to have former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe take up his position. Political analyst Ralph Mathekga commented to The Citizen, that this was a bold move by the Hawks if true. I find the Hawks to be so daring to investigate someone who is so close to Gordhan. This is part of the concerted effort to destabilise National Treasury, Mathekga said.
