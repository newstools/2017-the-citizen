It Is Written has been running against some of the top horses in the country but seemed to be going off the boil. It started in the Grade 1 Champions Cup at Greyville last year when he was beaten 11 lengths by Marinaresco and seemed to continue on his return to the Cape. A closer look at that form, however, tends to indicate he could be ready to win Race 8 at Fairview today, the Fairview Mile (Non-Black Type) over 1600m. His first run back was over 1200m, which is much too short but he followed that up with a fifth place in the Grade 2 Peninsula Handicap over 1800m at Kenilworth. He finished just 3.30 lengths off the winner, who happened to be none other than Grade 1 Sun Met winner, Whisky Baron. He has now moved to Justin Snaith s yard and that form should be good enough to see him win this Fairview Mile. Andrew Fortune takes the ride. Readytogorightnow bounced back to form last time when he won the Listed Memorial Mile over 1600m on the turf at Fairview on 16 December. He beat True Master by two lengths but got a massive 4kg penalty for that victory. Although he will now be carrying 61.5kg, it is just 1kg more than he had to shoulder last time and the overall opposition looks a little weaker. Last time he led shortly after the start and trainer Tara Laing appears to have worked wonders with the seven-year-old gelding to get him more active in the early stages of a race. Welsh Emperor has just been gelded and could show some improvement. For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
