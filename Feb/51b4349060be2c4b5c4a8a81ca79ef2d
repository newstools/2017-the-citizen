Dar es Salaam. Lightweight boxer, Mohamed Matumla, will have to wait for a year before giving the sport a second chance, it has been learnt.The 30-year-old underwent a brain surgery on Monday, hours after suffering what seemed to be a career-ending loss at the hands of Mfaume Mfaume.Matumla was sent to the canvass in the seventh round of the action-packed fight and never woke up until after the life-threatening surgery at the Muhimbili Orthopaedic Institute (MOI).MOI acting executive director Dr Othman Kiloloma confirmed to The Citizen yesterday that the surgery was successful and that Matumla is no longer at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).According to Kiloloma, the boxer will have to spend at least a 12 months before fighting competitively again. He had a blood clot in the brain, but a five-surgeon team managed to remove it successfully, he said. However, Matumla will not be able to fight at least after a year depending on recommendation of the doctor. He explained further: After the aforementioned period, he can return to the ring, but it is advisable that he puts on a head guard. Head guards are not allowed in professional boxing, thus it remains to be seen whether the hard-punching boxer will ever return to boxing.Tanzania Professional Boxing Commission (TPBC) secretary general Chatta Michael expressed his delight following a successful surgery, wishing Matumla a quick recovery.His father, Rashid Matula, one of the finest boxers during his heyday, was elated that his son came out of coma, but was doubtful over the chances of him returning to the ring again. It was a life-threatening incident and I don t think that he will play again. I personally will not allow him to do boxing. It is enough, said the 48-year-old legend.
