A full investigation into a physical confrontation between some union members and shop stewards at Impala Platinum (Implats) in Rustenburg is under way, the company said on Friday. Implats spokesperson Johan Theron said shop stewards arranged to speak to their members at 20 shaft before the morning shift started on Thursday. Regrettably, during this process, some union members reportedly became dismayed with the process/message, which resulted in a physical confrontation between some union members and shop stewards, Theron said. The situation was quickly brought under control by mine security, after which workers resumed their normal duties. He said there was no damage to mine property during the incident. Regrettably, some employees reporting for work during the confrontation were caught up in the scuffle and reportedly incurred damage to their motor vehicles we are presently investigating all reported cases. Some employees involved in the scuffle were treated by our medical personnel for minor injuries sustained during the incident. Theron said a full investigation was under way, and based on the outcome of the probe being carried out by senior mine and union personnel, disciplinary action might be instituted against individuals and/or groups of people implicated in misconduct. The union involved was the Association of Mineworkers and Construction (Amcu). African News Agency (ANA). For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
