Kagiso Rabada has a strong message for people worried about his workload: let me be the judge. The Proteas quick&#8217;s fitness has been a discussion point for the best part of the week now. 21-year-old Rabada missed the second One-day International against New Zealand due to a knee problem and the confirmation of an Indian Premier League (IPL) contract has raised further fears that he&#8217;s playing too much cricket. Yet he&#8217;s about the only one who doesn&#8217;t seem worried. Also read: To play KG or not play KG? That is the Proteas question &#8220;I feel fine. I believe I&#8217;m the main person when it comes to judging how my body feels,&#8221; Rabada said on Tuesday before Wednesday&#8217;s important fourth ODI against the Black Caps in Hamilton. &#8220;To be honest, sometimes you do play with niggles. Sometimes you feel fresh and the niggle comes and disappears again. Other times, the niggles stay around a little longer.&#8221; Ironically, having bowled over 700 international overs in 2016 has actually made Rabada a good judge of his own fitness. &#8220;The longer I&#8217;ve played, the more I&#8217;ve learned how to manage myself,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I value the advice of the medical staff and then act on it accordingly.&#8221; However, Rabada is well aware that he can&#8217;t make decisions based on self-interest. In a tight 2017 schedule, there&#8217;s naturally a bigger picture to consider. &#8220;It&#8217;s important to understand that sometimes you can&#8217;t play when you actually feel you&#8217;re up to it,&#8221; said Rabada. &#8220;You have to put your ego aside and do what&#8217;s best for you and the team. I feel I&#8217;ve managed that balance. I listen to team management, then assess on my own and then take the final course of action.&#8221; Despite his age, Rabada has suddenly become one of the more senior men in a side that&#8217;s blooding quite a number or rookies. &#8220;It&#8217;s an exciting time. There&#8217;s definitely a feeling that we&#8217;re approaching a new era. Of course there are still some experienced guys like Morne Morkel and Dale Steyn that we can use but the younger guys are gelling nicely,&#8221; he said. That doesn&#8217;t mean he considers himself a leader of the bowling attack. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see myself as that, even though many people say so,&#8221; said Rabada. &#8220;I&#8217;m just a player with certain responsibilities on the day. For me, it&#8217;s just about perfecting my skills and delivering.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
