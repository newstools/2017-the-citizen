Mamelodi residents took to the streets on Monday morning and barricaded Solomon Mahlangu Drive, protesting against poor service delivery and because Tshwane mayor Solly Msimanga has failed to visit the area since taking office. Senior Superintendent Isaac Mahamba, Tshwane metro police spokesperson, said the protesters blocked a part of the road with burning tyres and stones. We deployed metro police to the area and also warned motorists not to use the road, Mahamba said. Mayoral spokesperson Samkelo Mgobozi said the mayor has made commitments to visit as many communities as possible, as soon as possible. He appreciated the myriad variables and commitments he had to address. This includes engaging with his people and stakeholders so that we may rid ourselves of 20 years of the maladministration of the ANC, and tend to providing critical services to our people, Mgobozi said. He said although the city appreciated the frustration of residents, they must realise that 20 years of financial and infrastructure degradation cannot be reversed in six months of the new administration.
