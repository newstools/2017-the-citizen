Nkosinathi &#8216;DJ Black Coffee&#8217; Maphumulo has added his name to the list of people who were not impressed with the Metro FM Awards that took place at the ICC in Durban on Saturday night. Taking to Twitter on Sunday afternoon, the DJ criticised the awards&#8217; Best Remix category that he said did not have an actual remix that was nominated. What about his Alicia Keys remix that was on high rotation and played across the world? He asked. He said the awards were &#8220;definitely&#8221; not helping artists. &#8220;Most artists before us died poor&#8230;we are trying to fix our industry. Help us instead,&#8221; he said. Just watched the #MMA16&#8230;.maybe it&#39;s time @METROFMSA do what they do best and remain a Radio Station? &mdash; #PIECESOFME (@RealBlackCoffee) February 26, 2017 The DJ, who was not in attendance, said it was perhaps time for Metro FM to do what they do best &#8211; being a radio station, further commending Riky Rick for his acceptance speech at the awards. &#8220;I guess we&#8217;ve been quiet for too long&#8230;..Respects to @rikyrickworld for speaking the truth,&#8221; he said. Mabala Noise artist Riky Rick went on a rant during his acceptance speech in which he called the music that was being played on radio crap . He further said he was not happy about his award because there were artists who had no money but submitted their music to radio stations, but were, however, not getting airplay. &#8220;If niggaz can pay for these fucking awards then my nigga I dont want them &#8221; RIKY RICK 2016 #STAYSHINING &#x1f30d; (@rikyrickworld) February 25, 2017 Was he trying to tell us something about his stable that won big at the awards? His mic was cut off before he could continue with his rant but later he said to Khanyi Mbau and Somizi: Stop playing with the people, the people are not stupid. STOP PLAYING WITH THE PEOPLE WE NOT STUPID #STAYSHINING &#x1f30d; (@rikyrickworld) February 25, 2017 He further said he would not continue with what he wanted to say because people did not like to hear the truth.
