Several residents of Bela Bela, in Limpopo, were arrested on Tuesday after the local mayor s car was set alight in retaliation at a council decision to increase municipal rates, police said. A building was torched and the local mayor s vehicle set alight. The violence was sparked by the decision taken by council to increase rates. They then went on the rampage, barricading the streets leading into and out of the township. Police had to use rubber bullets to disperse the crowd, said police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo. Two police officers were injured when they were pelted with stones. It was not immediately clear if anyone from the community was injured, he added. Those arrested faced charges of arson, malicious damage to property and public violence and were expected to appear in court soon.
