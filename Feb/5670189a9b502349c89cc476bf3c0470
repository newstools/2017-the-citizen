Police have arrested a 26-year-old man in connection with a shooting in Rocklands, Mitchell s Plain, in which three people were shot, one of them fatally. Police spokesperson Captain FC Van Wyk said that on Friday, at about 8pm, police received a complaint of a shooting at the corners of Caravelle and Diamond streets in Rocklands. Upon their arrival, they noticed an unknown man lying on the ground with multiple gunshot wounds to his body. The victim, a 17-year-old, passed away on the scene, said Van Wyk. A second male victim, aged 26 years, also sustained a gunshot wound to his left ankle during the same incident. He was later taken to a nearby hospital by ambulance. A third victim had been shot twice in his right arm, once on his left finger and once on the right side of his chest, and was also admitted to hospital.
