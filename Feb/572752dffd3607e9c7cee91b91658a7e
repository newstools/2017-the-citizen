A 24-year-old man is due to appear in the Durban Magistrate s Court on Monday on charges of murder, armed robbery, and possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition, KwaZulu-Natal police said. &#8220;He was arrested on Friday by Cato Manor detectives and found in possession of three unlicensed firearms and ammunition,&#8221; Captain Nqobile Gwala said. Lindile Mngoma, 24, was at his house in Cato Crest just outside Durban at about 9.30pm on January 28 when he was approached by a man armed with a pistol. It was alleged that the man entered the house and took a cellphone, tablet, and clothing before shooting Mngoma. The victim sustained [a] gunshot wound and was rushed to hospital where he died on arrival. A case of murder and armed robbery was opened by the Cato Manor police station for further investigation. On Friday, local detectives followed up information about the whereabouts of the suspect in the Cato manor area. Through information, the suspect was arrested and was found in possession of three unlicensed firearms and ammunition, Gwala said. KwaZulu-Natal acting police commissioner Majaor-General Bheki Langa commended the members for their commitment and dedication that led to the arrest of the suspect and recovery of unlicensed firearms. The recovered firearms will be sent for ballistic tests to establish if they were used in any other crime in the province. I also encourage the community to come forward with information about people who are still in possession of unlicensed firearms. Such firearms are being used in violent crimes where innocent people are being killed or robbed of their valuable properties, he said. African News Agency (ANA)
