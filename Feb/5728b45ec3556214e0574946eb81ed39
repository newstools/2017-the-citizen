Dar es Salaam. Dar es Salaam is growing in population but the quality of life has been deteriorating as a result of poor urban planning, improper infrastructure and other challenges which make it expensive and difficult.A new World Bank report released yesterday reveals that access to water and sanitation is still limited throughout the city.The report bearing the title, Africa s Cities: Opening Doors to the World, also indicates that about two-third of households in Dar es Salaam share their toilet facilities, and there is some indication that access rates are relapsing.Areas like Tandale - one of the city s largest slums - are constantly growing in population despite their poor sanitations as their locations allow walking town due to costly transport.The report says cities in Sub-Saharan Africa are experiencing rapid population growth while their economic growth has not kept pace.The cities are said to be crowded, disconnected and costly; the three shared features that constrain urban development and create daily challenges for residents, the report says. What Africa needs are more affordable, connected, and livable cities, said Dr Makhtar Diop, World Bank Vice President for Africa. Improving the economic and social dividends from urbanisation will be critical as better developed cities could transform Africa s economies. Cities in Africa are reported to be costly for households, workers, and businesses. There are high building costs, slow but expensive commuter transport, and the need for higher wages to pay higher living costs which makes firms less productive and competitive. As a result, African cities are avoided by potential regional and global investors and trading partners, the report said.Despite low wages and high unemployment, the city is regarded as relatively expensive. A meal costs twice as much as in Bangkok even though average income in Bangkok is 23 times higher, the report stated.Dar es Salaam has more than 4.3 million residents, and the population is projected to reach 10 million or more by early 2030s.
