Police in Waterval are investigating a case of murder following a mob justice incident at Mpheni village, Limpopo police said on Sunday. According to information, on Saturday community members apprehended a Zimbabwean national of unknown age whom they accused of rape, Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said. They then took him to a house of the local community leader who in turn suggested to them that the police be called to take [the] matter forward. They refused and took the suspect away, assaulted [him], and set him on fire. The police were called and on arrival at the scene the victim had already burnt beyond recognition. The conduct of the Mpheni community is condemned in the strongest possible terms as it can only take us backward. We urge all members of the community to report any criminal activity to the police and refrain from resorting to acts of vigilantism. Anybody arrested for this incident will face a charge of murder. We [are] calling on anyone with information to contact the nearest police [station], Mojapelo said. African News Agency (ANA) For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
