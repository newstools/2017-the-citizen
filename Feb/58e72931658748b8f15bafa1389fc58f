Morogoro. The Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation (TPDC) and Swala Oil and Gas (Tanzania) plan to start drilling for the first oil well in September this year at Kilosa-Kilombero block. The drilling to establish whether there is oil will be carried out at Ipela Village in Malinyi, Morogoro Region. TPDC acting managing director Kapuulya Musomba told the Morogoro Regional Secretariat that the work would begin after completing exploration, which started 11 years ago. Currently, we are in the final stages of exploration and we expect to start drilling the first well in September this year, Mr Musomba said. TPDC geologist Magambo Samwel said Tanzania seems to have oil and gas just like Kenya and Uganda, but the truth will be known after drilling the first block. Though studies show that we have enough oil, the first well to be drilled in September will give us the full picture.
