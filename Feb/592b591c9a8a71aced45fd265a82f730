The name of the track is titled Loyal and social media has been abuzz since it dropped. Loyal is produced by Mash Beats who also left the record label. A Reece, who recently won the award for Lyricist Of The Year at the South African Hip Hop Awards hinted that Ambitiouz Entertainment artists don t get to keep their awards after winning them Where the F do are awards stay at? He went on say that he was being payed less than R20 000 at the label. He also mentioned that the publicists are buying cars before the musicians at Ambitiouz. Getting monthly pay of less than 20k was never part of the plan/ PR buying cars before the artist it doesn t match up . We were surprised to find out that Reece gets paid less than 20k. If you consider how often he gets booked and the amount of talent he possesses it s really sad. As the saying goes There re always two sides to the story so we ll wait for the representatives of the label to respond. However, in a tweet which was later removed on Sunday afternoon, Ambitiouz mentioned that they ll address A Reece &amp; Fifi Cooper s departure in a press release. Do you think everything A Reece has said on Loyal is true or do you think the label is just being falsely accused?
