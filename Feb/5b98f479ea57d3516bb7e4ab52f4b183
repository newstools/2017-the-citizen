Kyle Abbott once again reiterated transformation was not behind his decision to ditch the Proteas for a Kolpak contract. The 29-year-old seamer made headlines last month when he announced his decision to retire from international cricket, shortly after the second Test against Sri Lanka at Newlands.

Abbott, South Africa&#8217;s best seamer in that tournament, was controversially dropped for Vernon Philander before the semifinal against New Zealand after administrative interference. &#8220;I was very close to walking away after the 2015 World Cup and even a year later,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But I gave it another year because I wanted to play.&#8221; The man from Empangeni finally seemed to break into the Test squad late last year but by then had already signed his three-year deal with Hampshire. Abbott feels his decision to stay on for another 18 months after the 2015 showpiece proves he&#8217;s no &#8220;traitor&#8221;. &#8220;You can understand the emotions I went through then and having the opportunity to leave, then and there. But I said &#8216;I can&#8217;t&#8217;,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That, I felt, would have been me being a traitor and turning my back. But I&#8217;ve given it another two years since then.&#8221; Instead, Abbott insists his decision to leave is based on the outlook that he would still only be selected if someone else were injured. &#8220;It&#8217;s been a tough four years. Things never ran smoothly. A seed was planted early after I made my debut and it took me 11 months to get back into a squad,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That was four years ago and I&#8217;ve played 12 Test matches. I&#8217;m not saying I deserved to play 50 in those four years, but even in ODIs and T20s I haven&#8217;t even got to 30 in either of those. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to be 30 this year and I can&#8217;t see how any of this is going to change.&#8221; Also read: Kyle Abbott: I didn t quit because of transformation Abbott also has a strong message for transformation naysayers &#8211; South African cricket has accepted it. &#8220;It&#8217;s the way things are going and I think South Africa has embraced it now because we&#8217;ve actually come out now and said what we are doing,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There is nowhere to hide. In the past there were times when decisions were made and guys were asking &#8216;Is it because of this?&#8217; and nobody could answer. Now we&#8217;re saying &#8216;These are the rules&#8217; and I think everybody is at peace with that.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
