Handre Pollard earlier this week joked that he&#8217;s &#8220;not a guy made to be on stage&#8221;. That&#8217;s a bit of an ironic thing for the Bulls&#8217; flyhalf and stand-in captain to say. Also read: Handre Pollard better get used to being a saviour in 2017 Consider this. The 22-year-old pivot hasn&#8217;t played a competitive match since the 2015 World Cup. Saturday&#8217;s Super Rugby derby against the Stormers at Newlands is actually the first game he&#8217;ll play in the new era under coach Nollis Marais. He&#8217;s expected to regain his form fairly quickly because he need to sort out some of the Springboks&#8217; backline problems. And, along with all these factors, Pollard also needs to lead the Bulls. Some might say that&#8217;s a crazy amount of responsibility for such a young man. But history suggests otherwise. Pollard captained the Western Province Craven Week side; he was the only 18-year-old in the World Championship-winning Baby Bok team in 2012; he later captained them; he made his Test debut as a 20-year-old and played against the All Blacks in a World Cup semifinal as a 21-year-old. &#8220;I&#8217;m used to captaining my peers,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But the Bulls captaincy is definitely a step up. It&#8217;s a bit harder to lead players who are older than you are. But it isn&#8217;t supposed to be a problem if you operate in a great environment. As a flyhalf, you&#8217;re mostly in control of things on the field, so captaincy is kind of a natural thing.&#8221; That truly is the talk of a man who is clearly comfortable being in the spotlight. &#8220;Every player has his own goals for the season,&#8221; said Pollard. &#8220;Mine are very simple. I just want to get back on the field and play my best rugby. I really want to get back to where I was more than a year back. But I&#8217;m not trying to look too far ahead.&#8221; Speaking of team environments, the exciting No 10 admits he was quite lucky with the type of leadership he was exposed to. &#8220;It&#8217;s amazing actually. I played under leaders like Victor Matfield, Jean de Villiers, Schalk Burger, Fourie du Preez and Adriaan Strauss,&#8221; said Pollard. &#8220;These are men known for their unique leadership qualities and are legends of South African rugby. I learnt lessons from each of them.&#8221; Yet first and foremost, South African rugby needs Pollard to cope with the pressures of the position he plays in. He&#8217;s not concerned though about how the game might&#8217;ve changed in his absence. &#8220;I&#8217;d love to find out at the weekend,&#8221; chuckled Pollard. &#8220;From the outside though, it doesn&#8217;t seem as if there have been many changes. The intensity and tempo seems to have remained the same. I can&#8217;t wait for another taste.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
