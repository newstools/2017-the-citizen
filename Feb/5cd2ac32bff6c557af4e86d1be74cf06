&#8216;Sushi King&#8217; and businessman Kenny Kunene has announced he will tie the knot with his long-time girlfriend Nonkululeko Whitney Mhlanga in a traditional ceremony to be held in Kimberley in March. Kenny, 46, met the 22-year-old Mhlanga four years ago and knew &#8220;instantly&#8221; that she was the one, though he had doubts about the age gap between them. But it was Mhlanga&#8217;s maturity that made him realise age would not be a problem. Kenny would have married Mhlanga two years ago had she not insisted on finishing her studies first, he told the website WeeklyXpose, which he funds. The website also published copyrighted photographs, which the photographer requires money for allowing the republishing of. The Zulu ceremony, umembeso, will see Kenny&#8217;s family handing gifts to Mhlanga&#8217;s family to thank them for their daughter while he gets to be welcomed in the family as their son-in-law. The march event will only be a traditional ceremony, and the white wedding would only follow later, he says. Kenny also announced his wife was expecting a baby boy a first child for her and the fourth for him.
