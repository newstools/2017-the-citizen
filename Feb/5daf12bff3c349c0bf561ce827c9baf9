Greyville are holding another of their Quickfire20/20 race days when there are only 20 minutes between races and this allows the apprentices to have four races to show their talents. Craig Bantam, a 4kg claimer, has shown promise in the Western Cape when given the opportunity and has already ridden 12 winners so he could do the business on Rockefeller in Race 6, a MR 69 Apprentice Handicap over 1600m on the Polytrack tonight. The three-year-old gelding had been a bit disappointing since winning early on in his career but put that all behind him with a solid win in his latest start. The form of that win has proven to be a bit suspect and Rockefeller picked up an eight-point penalty. Clearly that is the reason trainer Charles Laird has opted for 4kg claimer; to negate the penalty. Trainer Gareth van Zyl has done very well since taking out his own license and All Honesty in Race 2, a Maiden Plate over 2000m could give him another winner. This Elusive Fort three-year-old filly could enjoy trying this longer distance. Another yard that normally does well with its runners on this surface is the Doug Campbell yard and both Vallanaut in Race 1 and Strummer in Race 8 should run big races.
