KwaZulu-Natal Premier Willies Mchunu said: Implementation is one of the areas of our weaknesses. He said there was no dispute that the country had one of the best constitutions in the world and that many of the policies were very good. He urged delegates to reflect on the effectiveness of government. We need to ask ourselves [how] have we served the people of KwaZulu-Natal, he said. He said that the province had achieved much during the past year since the previous cabinet lekgotla. He praised the provincial education department for turning around the free fall in poor matric examination results, but warned that more improvement was needed. Speaking to the media, after addressing delegates, he said that the performance of each department would be looked at. Mchunu expressed concern at the ongoing violence in the province and the number of murders committed. African News Agency (ANA) For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
