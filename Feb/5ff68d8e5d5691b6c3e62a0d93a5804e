Dar es Salaam. Lack of national data of people aged 50 and above who are affected or living with HIV/Aids has been a challenge as a result this group cannot benefit from plans and services targeting victims of the pandemic. There data are very limited, scattered and disintegrated.Globally, there are 5.8 million people aged over 50 years living with the virus. Low and middle income countries carry the largest share of the burden, with the number expected to rise from 4.7 million to 6.7 million by 2020.Most of researches and other data collection tools in the country have been targeting people ageing 15-49 years. There are also researches conducted targeting children, but there has no national study specific for victims age 50 and above.Tanzania s population is currently estimated to be 50 million people of which six per cent are aged 60 years and above. Unfortunately, this group has been forgotten completely in HIV/Aids plans and services.In an effort to respond to that, older people (those aged 50 and above) from Tanzania, Zimbabwe and South Africa met in Dar es Salaam on Thursday and Friday last week to discuss and address the challenge.At the forum, organised by Help Age International, participants from the three countries noted that people beyond the age of 50 are at more risk of catching HIV/Aids because they increasingly left out of most projects.HelpAge Programme Manager Juliana Bernard told participants that her organisation had conducted a number of researches which found that the number of older people living with HIV/Aids who were not covered by current care and treatment services, including access to anti-retroviral drugs (ARVs).Ms Bernard remembered that older people remained sexually active and they could get infected like any members of other groups. And this is why were are sensitising key stakeholders drawn from three countries to realise the need to extend age range used in collecting data on prevalence, prevention, care and treatment of HIV and Aids, she said.Data disaggregationThe forum also recommended the authorities to not only include them but also disaggregate the data into those specific groups, including older people.United Nations Programme on HIV/Aids (UNAIDS) Country Programme Manager Fredrick Macha said disaggregation of data is important for informed programme implementation and monitoring.He said that disaggregated data ensure that resources are spent where they are needed most while at the same time provide effective services and programmes. A critical analysis based on disaggregated data can confirm what is really occurring in the society and therefore take appropriate interventions. It can also be a platform for advocating specific policy changes for targeted funding opportunities, said Mr Macha.Speaking on behalf of the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) Managing Director Albina Chuwa, the NBS s Acting Director of Statistics, Mr Irenius Ruyobya, pointed out that it s true that most of the national surveys haven t examined those aged 50 and above.He said that formerly it was regarded that older people were at a low risk of contacting HIV/Aids that s why many studies did not focus on them.However, he said, latest reports on the global HIV/Aids burden indicate that at least 17 per cent of people living with the virus are older people. Current, we estimate that at least six per cent are those aged 60 and above some of whom live with HIV/Aids which we don t know exactly how many they are because unfortunately our past researches did not study those ageing above 50 years old. So I truly insist that there is a need to have these people also studied because you cannot plan about them without knowing their number because and with the increase of life span of those taking Antiretrovial it is crucial that we also focus on them since they also also a risk group, said Mr Ruyobya.Inclusive survey underwayMeanwhile, the government is conducting a countrywide survey to establish the current burden and analyse the impact of various interventions made to combat the disease.The Tanzania HIV/Aids Impact Survey will help the government to identify the gap and unmet needs of health related services to those living with the virus.Carried out by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the study aim at learning new risk factors leading to new HIV cases.The Project Coordinator Mariam Kitembe said preliminary results of the study will be released in October. We have already collected the data in Dodoma, Songea, Manyara, Iringa, Njombe, Mbeya and Songwe from which 40,000 adults and 9000 children were involved, said Ms Kitembe.According to her, the current study is all inclusive since the adult population (those aged 50 and above) are involved as well.
