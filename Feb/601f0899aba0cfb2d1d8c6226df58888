President Jacob Zuma s eldest son Edward, has sprung to his father defence again following the chaotic scenes of violence that engulfed Parliament on Thursday night during the annual State of the Nation Address (Sona). He has squarely placed the blame for the deterioration of violence in the National Assembly, which resulted in EFF members of parliament being brutally removed from the house and the DA staging a walkout, on the red berets and the official opposition, saying the upheaval sent the wrong message to the world about the country. Edward said both parties claimed to respect the country s constitution, but surprisingly they decided to disrespect it last night [Thursday] . It s very surprising because we were expecting to listen to the president of the republic speaking to the nation What they actually did was very much embarrassing to everybody he said during an interview with East Coast Radio on Friday morning. ALSO READ: Zuma: EFF is nothing but an angry minority Edward said his father did not care much about the personal insults hurled at him by the EFF but cared more about the country. The party referred to Zuma numerous times before his address to the nation as a constitutional delinquent and criminal. The president doesn t also take that serious what he takes serious is the disrespecting of the country. You know it s not about the president individually; to him it s always about the country. He cares more about the country than himself. I am speaking as an individual and a South African citizen that sits and observes. I know that I m related to the president but I do not speak on behalf of the president nor do I speak on behalf of the family. But as a person who is an activist myself in the ANC I have every right to make my comments he said.
