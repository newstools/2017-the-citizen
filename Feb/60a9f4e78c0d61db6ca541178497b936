&#8216;Sushi King&#8217; Kenny Kunene and poet Ntsiki Mazwai were at each other&#8217;s throats on Sunday afternoon in a conversation that left the two debating on who has more achievements. Kenny said that he found a post on Instagram criticising EFF leader Julius Malema and went on to share it on Twitter. The post reads: &#8220;Julius will tell us why Fifi Cooper left Ambitiouz Entertainment before the official media statement is even typed!&#8221; Saw this post on insta. It&#39;s now confirmed @Julius_S_Malema is indeed mamgozi, gossip monger, raleleme, mosebi. Even rappers know this&#8230; pic.twitter.com/zBu4TBjtBC &mdash; Kenny Kunene (@Kenny_T_Kunene) February 19, 2017 This, according to Kenny, was a confirmation that Malema was &#8220;indeed mamgozi, gossip monger, raleleme, mosebi. Even rappers know this.&#8221; The post did not seem to please Mazwai, who told Kenny to stop being a &#8220;cry baby&#8221; and focus on growing his business Rivonia on Deck. Kenny returned the favour and advised Mazwai to stop focusing on his business, and use her advice to grow her poetry talent. The difference between the two, according to Mazwai, is that she knows how to balance her brand, reminding him that she just got her master&#8217;s degree for her poetry. &#8220;Thanks for support,&#8221; she told Kenny. She might have just obtained her master&#8217;s, but even Kenny knows what he wants and how to get it, he said, further bragging about his business. I just got R190 million for my business my suster. Thanks for support. Thing is I know what I want n how to get it. I am not a product/brand https://t.co/JnkfNOGOG1 &mdash; Kenny Kunene (@Kenny_T_Kunene) February 19, 2017 &#8220;I just got R190 million for my business my suster. Thanks for support. Thing is I know what I want and how to get it. I am not a product/brand.&#8221; Mazwai accused Kenny of getting his money from tenders and ANC connections, further telling him that she was still bigger, more powerful, more principled and younger than him. But if we were throwing insults i would tell u that i may be dirty but i can wash.youre a pervert who looks like a Russian THAT wont change https://t.co/KSRNEuZOav &mdash; Imbongikazi yeSizwe (@ntsikimazwai) February 19, 2017 &#8220;Congratulations. Let young people learn from you that education is important and so is being presentable and very clean. Congrats again,&#8221; he responded. &#8220;You&#8217;re a pervert who looks like a Russian that won&#8217;t change,&#8221; she told him. Anyway, there&#8217;s clearly no love lost between the two as Kenny ended up telling Mazwai he loved her and they should go out for lunch some time. You started me with insults anyway I rest my case. It&#39;s Sunday. You know I love you though. Let&#39;s have lunch sometime https://t.co/K74IGaunKH &mdash; Kenny Kunene (@Kenny_T_Kunene) February 19, 2017 When asked if the two were really fighting over Malema, Mazwai said their fight had nothing to do with the EFF leader. She was just advising Kenny to focus on his brand, she said.
