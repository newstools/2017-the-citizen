Don t hold your breath, but all indications are that the disgraced figure of former SABC executive Hlaudi Motsoeneng will no longer be able to use his pass to gain entry to the public broadcaster. An appeal (yet another in a long saga of legal wranglings) in the Western Cape High Court this week for him to keep his job was dismissed. The court found that Motsoeneng holding any position at the SABC was invalid, following a ruling in November that his appointment as group executive of corporate affairs the post he had held previously before he became chief operating officer was irrational and unlawful . Motsoeneng, reported to have hijacked the reins of power at the SABC, bending a cowed and ineffective board to his demands and holding experienced broadcasting executives in thrall, was repeatedly named before a parliamentary ad hoc committee into the fitness of the now dissolved board as the real power broker. He had indicated earlier that he would speak out at a later stage. We would like to suggest that now is the time for Motsoeneng to open up. The sorry SABC saga has dragged on for far too long.
