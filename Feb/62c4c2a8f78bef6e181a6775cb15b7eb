Heidi Dalton stunned a quality field on Saturday to win the elite women&#8217;s road race at the SA Road Cycling Championships in Wellington. The 21-year-old rider broke away from the peloton and produced a superb solo effort to finish nearly four minutes clear of her nearest competitor. Defending champion An-Li Kachelhoffer grabbed second spot, edging out Commonwealth Games bronze medallist Ashleigh Moolman-Pasio, who won the time trial title earlier in the week, in a tight sprint. The elite men&#8217;s road race was set to be held on Sunday, closing out the week-long national championships. For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
