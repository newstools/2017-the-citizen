The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) was on board with an agreement between government, business, labour and civil society that the minimum wage be set at R20 an hour effective from May 1, next year, Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa said on Wednesday. On Tuesday, all those involved in the National Economic Development and Labour Council (Nedlac) process to set the minimum wage signed the agreement, except Cosatu. Ramaphosa said this was not because they did not accept the agreement, but because the union had to report back to its central executive committee in terms of its processes.

We were seeking to balance the issue of increasing the wages of up to 6.6 millon workers [earning below R3 500 per month] this wage could easily have been 20 thousand rand, 10 thousand rand. In doing so there would have been a negative impact where many workers would have lost their jobs through the introduction of an overly high minimum wage, said Ramaphosa. Ramaphosa stressed government did not believe this was a living wage , but that it was a start. If we get to the living wage we all desire, it would wipe out a lot of jobs. Ramaphosa said a commission would be set up to review the national mininum wage on an annual basis. African News Agency For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
