Stormers flyer Leolin Zas&#8217; worst fear has come to pass. The Cape Town fanchise on Monday confirmed the 21-year-old winger will be out of rugby for a year after breaking his leg during Saturday&#8217;s 57-40 warm-up win over the Lions at Newlands. And if you&#8217;re wondering why he&#8217;ll be on the sidelines for so long &#8211; Zas broke both the fibula and tibia of his left leg. Also read: The Lions are in danger of losing a big weapon That means the long, thin bone of his lower leg as well as the larger bone between the knee and ankle has been fractured. In any book, that&#8217;s a massive, serious injury. &#8220;I feel really sorry for Leolin,&#8221; said Robbie Fleck, the Stormers&#8217; head coach. &#8220;It was going to be a big year for him.&#8221; Zas had already impressed in the Stormers&#8217; mediocre Super Rugby campaign last year. To compound the franchise&#8217;s problems, Springbok centre Juan de Jongh will also be absent for at least three months. De Jongh sustained ligament damage to a knee. The problem with him being missing is that it robs the Stormers of leadership. De Jongh was co-captain last year with prop Frans Malherbe. Zas&#8217; void has already been filled by the experienced Bjorn Basson, who&#8217;s moved on after the Bulls deemed him a surplus to requirements. And now, it&#8217;s also been revealed that another veteran, Joe Pietersen, is training at Newlands. The 32-year-old proved a fine recruit for the Sharks in 2016 but at this stage it seems unlikely that he&#8217;ll feature for the Stormers unless there&#8217;s a pressing need. &#8220;He&#8217;s contracted to go back to Japan at the end of the year and he merely wants to stay fit in their off-season,&#8221; said Fleck. &#8220;He is here to help, to groom some youngsters. And if we need to call on him we can. So it s a good relationship we ve got with Joe. We&#8217;ll play our youngsters and back them but Joe can help out in an emergency.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
