Imran Tahir has tasted so much success in the past two years that it was difficult not to detect a bit of boredom in Faf du Plessis&#8217; voice when asked about him again. The Proteas&#8217; colourful leg-spinner was once again a match-winner for his country on Friday after his 5/24 helped ensure a 78-run win over New Zealand in the solitary T20 at Eden Park in Auckland. &#8220;I&#8217;ve said this numerous times before. Imran is one of the big reasons why we&#8217;ve been so successful the past ten months,&#8221; said Du Plessis. &#8220;The amazing thing about him is that he&#8217;s become so consistent. As a captain, that is a massive weapon.&#8221; Also read: Imran Tahir bowls it on a string as Proteas thrash Black Caps Perhaps Tahir&#8217;s greatest attribute nowadays isn&#8217;t that he merely takes vital wickets. He turns off the tun taps as well. &#8220;Even when opponents get off to a good start, you know the chance of Immie doing well is very high,&#8221; said Du Plessis. &#8220;He&#8217;s not bowling a lot of bad balls anymore. He puts a lot of pressure on teams with his skill and variations.&#8221; However, for once, Tahir didn&#8217;t need to drag South Africa back into the game. Instead, he merely finished what the impressively adaptable Chris Morris (2/10) and Andile Phehlukwayo (3/19) had set up. And that, more than anything, gave Du Plessis satisfaction. &#8220;The seamers really did the damage upfront. It would&#8217;ve been tough for New Zealand to have recovered from their strikes,&#8221; said Du Plessis. &#8220;For me, it&#8217;s a really nice challenge to manage the attack currently. It&#8217;s a really young bowling unit, extremely eager to buy into what is needed on the day. Chris with the new ball, it is a relatively new job for him for the Proteas and I thought he bowled with really good heat.&#8221; But it would seem he is conscious of the fact that the Proteas need to keep their options open for just a while longer before the tour of England &#8230; and the ICC Champions Trophy. &#8220;Someone like Morne Morkel has done really well in one-day cricket. He&#8217;s someone on the outside but he&#8217;s very much part of the plans,&#8221; said Du Plessis. &#8220;You could pick any of the guys who are here though if Morne doesn&#8217;t come through. I&#8217;d be very happy from a T20 point of view and I know AB from a one-day point of view is also very happy.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
