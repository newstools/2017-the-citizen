Jockey Anton Marcus is the dominant force in KwaZulu-Natal and with him having a night off Anthony Delpech can be the one who benefits most at Greyville Polytrack on Friday night. The best of his rides could be Heptagon In Race 3, a MR 62 Handicap over 1400m and Night Circus in Race 6, a MR 70 Handicap over 1900m. Greg Anthony-trained Heptagon showed he is capable of winning off his current rating of 63 as he has been close up in both his last two runs off this revised mark. This course and distance holds no fears and although he does have an awkward draw to overcome it is by no means an obstacle to prevent Heptagon from winning his third race. Mambo In Seattle gelding Night Circus proved a disappointment when beaten at a short price in his latest start but he was probably too far back and from pole position draw this time Delpech is unlikely to make that same error again. The wins by Night Circus over 2000m in December and 1600m in January on this surface suggest he does have more in the tank. For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
