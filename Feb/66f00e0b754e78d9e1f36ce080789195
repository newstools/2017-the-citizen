The Gauteng department of education (GDE) has confirmed that a former employee of a prestigious Johannesburg school was under investigation following sexual assault allegations of about nine learners. Media relations officer Nanagolo Leopeng on Tuesday said: We recieved a report from the school that there was a case of sexual assault by a student employee who was appointed by the school s governing body. The student employee who was assisting at the boarding house as well as with coaching is being accused of inappropriately touching learners at the boarding house. He was discovered via CCTV footage showing him touching the boys in the common room of the hostel and later in the victim&#8217;s bedroom, Leopeng said. The man resigned from the school immediately after he was discovered, therefore no disciplinary action could be taken against him, but a criminal case was opened. The principal has been providing psychological support to the learners who have been victims of this misconduct, and the school is conducting an investigation to get to the bottom of what has transpired. More learners have since come up, the principal has spoken to parents and taken them through what has happened and encouraged affected learners to come forward. Leopeng said that the department was continuing to work with the South African Council of Educators (Sace) to ensure that all educators were screened before being allocated to a school. The incident occurred in October 2016 and the accused made his first appearance in the Johannesburg Magistrates&#8217; Court in November. The case will return to the Johanesburg Magistrates&#8217; Court in March where it will be transferred to the high court.
