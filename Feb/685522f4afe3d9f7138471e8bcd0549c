Isingamoya loves running at Scottsville and is at her best over 1200m so when Mark Dixon s filly lines up over that course and distance one needs to take note. That s what is happening in Race 5 at Scottsville on Wednesday when Isingamoya takes on nine other fillies and mares in an FM 92 Handicap. This daughter of Muhtafal has raced six times at Scottsville for three wins and two third and has a record of four wins, one second placing and two thirds in eight runs over 1200m. Over the course and distance she has run five times for three wins and two thirds. Brandon Lerena takes the ride and his record on this filly further improves the statistics as he has ridden her once for one win. That was in May last year and was naturally over 1200m at Scottsville. Dixon brought her up to Turffontein for the Grade 3 Magnolia Handicap over 1160m in which she ran fourth behind Green Pepper and last time she took in the boys in a Pinnacle Stakes over 1200m at Greyville and that was her only unplaced run over 1200m. After leading through the 400m she faded late to run a 3.75-length fifth behind Amazon King. Two winners from three runners have come out of that formline. One has to go back to November 2015 for the last time Free State visited the No 1 box but she has not been unplaced in her five subsequent runs. She is another who loves the track and one has to give her a massive chance in this field, especially as Anton Marcus has picked up the ride.
