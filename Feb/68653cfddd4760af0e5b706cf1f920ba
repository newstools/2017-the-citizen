Wenger is under pressure after successive defeats left his side 12 points below Premier League leaders Chelsea, deepening divisions between the pro-Wenger and anti-Wenger factions among Arsenal&#8217;s support. Ahead of Saturday&#8217;s home game with Hull City, he urged supporters to rally behind their team &#8212; and used local rivals Tottenham as an example. &#8220;We are in a fight. We absolutely have to be united or we have no chance to do it,&#8221; said the Frenchman, in comments that were plastered across the sports pages of British newspapers on Friday. &#8220;You have Tottenham, everyone is in the fight and everyone is behind their team. We have to do exactly the same, even if we had two disappointing results.&#8221; Spurs are currently three points above Arsenal in second place and on course to finish above their north London neighbours for the first time since 1995.
