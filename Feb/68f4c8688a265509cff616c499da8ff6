Taking aim at two of South Africa s favourite gripes Jacob Zuma used his State of the Nation speech on Thursday to announce a programme designed to tackle unemployment and water shortages. Acknowledging that South Africa s drought problems couldn t be blamed entirely on what fell from the heavens, Zuma said around 10,000 unemployed young people were being trained as plumbers, artisans and water agents to tackle wastage of water from leaking municipal pipes and so on. He said the training programme was part of efforts to curb high water losses, which in some municipalities far exceeded the national average of 37 percent. We call upon municipalities to support the War on Leaks programme, he said, adding that the training programme would be expanded this year to reach a total of 15,000 young unemployed people.
