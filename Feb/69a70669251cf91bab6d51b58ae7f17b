A man was killed and two other people were injured when a bakkie and a car collided on the N4 near the Kroonvaal turn-off in Rustenburg early on Sunday morning, North West paramedics said. ER24 paramedics, along with another service, arrived on the scene to find the bakkie in the middle of the road and the car on the side of the road, ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring said. Upon closer inspection, paramedics found the body of a man lying in the light motor vehicle showing no signs of life. Unfortunately, nothing could be done for the man and he was declared dead on the scene. The two occupants of the bakkie, a man and woman, were assessed and found to have sustained moderate injuries. Paramedics treated the patients and thereafter transported them to a nearby hospital for further treatment. The cause of the collision was not yet known, Meiring said. African News Agency (ANA)
