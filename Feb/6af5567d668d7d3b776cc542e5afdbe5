Cape Town s firefighters were hard at work trying to extinguish several blazes amid high temperatures and dry conditions on Monday. City of Cape Town spokesperson Tracey Whittaker said they responded to two fires in Atlantis and a vegetation fire in Kensington during lunchtime. A large vegetation fire had raged on the corner of Voortrekker Road and 18th Avenue in Kensington and was burning close to several shacks. Whittaker said six fire engines, four water tankers, and 38 firefighters were busy trying to extinguish the blaze. Another fire that threatened wood and iron structures was reported on the West Cost Road in Atlantis. Whittaker said four fire engines and 20 firefighters were on scene. Just after lunchtime the City responded to another fire in Atlantis, this time in Lukasrand, Beacon Hill. Six fire engines, one water tender and a total of 35 firefighters were deployed, with some aerial support, said Whittaker. The cause of the three fires is unknown at this stage. Meanwhile, the City of Cape Town Nature Conservation had sent in two teams to assist 27 firefighters in Parklands. A strong South Easterly wind was hampering firefighting efforts. Whittaker warned residents of Parklands, Sunningdale, Table View, Duynefontein and Melkbos that they would be affected by smoke and ash from the fire. The City still has two fire engines and ten firefighters in Hout Bay, where a fire has been raging for the past few days. Working on Fire (WoF) teams and members of the Table Mountain National Park were helping, along with some aerial support.
