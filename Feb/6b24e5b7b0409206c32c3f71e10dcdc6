As South African Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan announced a new tax bracket and rate for South Africa s super rich on Wednesday, he reported back on another Robin Hood-style initiative announced in the budget a year ago. Making his budget speech in parliament, Gordhan said applications to the Special Voluntary Disclosure Programme announced in the 2016 budget, which was designed to bring foreign assets into the tax net, had begun. He said the South African Revenue Service had already received disclosures of R3.8 billion in foreign assets, which would yield revenue of about R600 million. Launching the Special Voluntary Disclosure Programme last year, Gordhan had warned South Africans who were illegally holding assets overseas that the game was almost up anyway and urged them to take advantage of the opportunity to regularise their foreign assets and income by voluntary disclosing information. He told those who did not already know that a new international agreement would soon see tax authorities automatically exchanging information, which would make it harder to hide. In Wednesday s speech Gordhan reminded the country that further automatic exchange of information between tax authorities would come into operation in September this year. He added that multinational companies would be required to file further information with the South African Revenue Service on cross-border activities from the end of the year. We will continue to work actively with the international tax community and within government to modernise customs administration and combat cross-border revenue leakages, money laundering and harmful tax practices, he said.
