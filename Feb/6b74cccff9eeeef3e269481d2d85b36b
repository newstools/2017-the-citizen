I know that our team will be up against top outfits from other countries, but I believe they have what it takes to shine, he said.Egypt, who won the Zone V Championship in Uganda in 2014, are among the most feared teams in Africa.The North African country faced stiff opposition from the Uganda who finished runners up.Burundi, Egypt, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda are among countries expected to battle it out for top honours at the anxiously awaited event.There will be only two slots up for grabs for the Zone V countries during the championship.The winners and runners up will join 14 other teams across Africa at the 29th edition of the men s continental championship to be held in Congo Brazzaville later this year.In 2014, Uganda qualified ahead of neighbours Kenya and Rwanda with the home crowd taking a little bit of the credit for pushing the team.Reports from Egypt had it yesterday that preparations for the evenmt were on course.
