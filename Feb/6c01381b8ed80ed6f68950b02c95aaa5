As much as we ve begun daytime operations in various entry points in and out of our area, we also want to concentrate on getting dangerous drivers off the road,&#8221; said Deokaran. &#8220;Too many motorists are still risking their own safety as well as that of other road users by driving their vehicles after they have consumed alcohol. It is truly concerning how common place drunk driving is.&#8221; He added there would be more roadblocks throughout the course of the year.
