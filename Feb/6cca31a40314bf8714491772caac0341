Western Cape-based trainer Justin Snaith has taken some fresh stock to his yard in Port Elizabeth and if some of them run up to their Cape Town form, the yard should be in for a good day at Fairview on Friday. He also teams up with jockey Gavin Lerena who is fighting hard to regain his title as champion jockey so Snaith s runner will have all the support they need from the saddle. The Breeders Guineas Plate for three-year-old fillies over 1400m heads up the meeting and in this event Snaith sends out The Merry Widow who has excellent form. This daughter of Captain Al is tiny but is all heart and showed her ability when winning her first three starts, including the Listed East Cape Nursery over 1200m at this course. After that she returned to Cape Town and beat Live Life in the Perfect Promise Sprint (Listed) over 1200m at Kenilworth. The Merry Widow lost form but her last two runs have been promising. She came back from a short rest to run 8.30 lengths behind Live Life in Sceptre Stakes and last time suffered some interference when finishing a 0.50-length second behind Story Of My Life over this course and distance. The main threat is likely to come from Hurricane Shelley who is in good form. She hails from the Alan Greeff yard and they are churning out winners. She has run five times over the course and distance for two wins and two places and should hold Star Burst Galaxy on their run in Guineas Plate in November. On that occasion Hurricane Shelley won by 4.25 lengths and they meet at the same weights again. For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
