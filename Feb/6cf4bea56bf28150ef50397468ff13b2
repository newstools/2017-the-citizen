If you thought you had seen it all in South Africa, think again. There is an advertisement circulating on Twitter of a supposed testimony from Idris Elba claiming to have been helped by a Dr Saleh start a big supermarket and a taxi business. The ad uses his picture and explains how he used &#8220;Dr Saleh&#8217;s miracle water&#8221; to sort out his financial problems. Here we were thinking Elba was a British actor in line to be the first black James Bond, but no, he is in fact a taxi and supermarket owner in South Africa. Either that, or he has a twin brother here who is. Perhaps he needs to explain. The testimony reads: &#8220;I was working, but I could not save any money because of my debts. My life changed when DR Saleh and Mama came to my house. He gave me a miracle water that costed R600 and he told me to wash myself and my family with it. Dr Saleh told me to start a small family business of my own and in only one year, I managed to raise enough money to start up a big supermarket. Presently I am owning about 5 taxis, have my own big house fully paid. Now I live a stress free life with my family and all my kids are in good schools [sic].&#8221; Check @Ntshalie pic.twitter.com/X6qGsmnCgC &mdash; Breaking Dad (@Khuze_Elikhulu) February 19, 2017
