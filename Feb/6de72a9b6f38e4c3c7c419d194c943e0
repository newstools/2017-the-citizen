In an interview with Power FM, Nonhle Thema spoke about how she felt relieved that she no longer had &#8216;it&#8217; girl status. Thema made headlines for the wrong reasons a few years ago when she had a public meltdown after taking to Twitter to boast about her lifestyle, making millions and being famous. &#8220;I was done with this &#8216;it&#8217; girl thing when Bonang really stepped up. I was like woah, she saved me! Because honestly I was at the pinnacle of the industry as a female, especially when I did my reality show. &#8220;I was the go-to person then, I also [fed the media frenzy], I liked dating rappers, I was everything, not knowing that I was losing my soul through it all because I became someone I wasn&#8217;t really. So I was really happy when the &#8216;it&#8217; girl status was relinquished from me. &#8220;The old me is gone. I have no desire to sit and interview rappers or sit and interview celebrity culture because I&#8217;ve been there,&#8221; said Thema.
