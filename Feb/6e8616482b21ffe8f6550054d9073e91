Gold Fields said on Friday it expected an increase of between 730 percent and 780 percent in headline earnings per share for the year to the end of December. At the normalised level, earnings per share are expected to be 280-320 percent higher than a year before. The JSE and New York-listed miner said the improvement was primarily driven by an increase in the dollar gold price and lower net operating costs in local currencies as well as the impact of converting these costs at weaker exchange rates. The full results are expected on February 16. African News Agency (ANA) For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
