 It is believed that the elderly man went looking for for his cattle in the rain a week ago and never returned home, ER24 spokesperson Annine Dormehl said on Sunday. The man was apparently found on the R31 about 30km from Kuruman in the Northern Cape. ER24 paramedics were contacted by the police and when they arrived they found the man to be severely dehydrated. He was transported by ER24 to the Kuruman Hospital for further treatment, Dormehl said. For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
