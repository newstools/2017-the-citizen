by Ian WINROW Kane, 23, scored a first half hat-trick in his club&#8217;s 4-0 victory over Stoke City, reaching the century mark with his first goal and ending the game with his season tally on 22 goals. The striker s effort helped Spurs bounce back after the disappointment of going out of the Europa League against Gent this week and Pochettino believes Kane s all-round display confirmed his qualities as one of the world s most dangerous forwards. &#8220;Harry has the profile to be a legend (at Tottenham),&#8221; said the Spurs manager. &#8220;Maybe he s starting to be a legend with the goals he&#8217;s scoring and the way he behaves. &#8220;He is so professional. He has the perfect profile to be a legend here. He has his character. Sometimes he argues with me. Sometimes he s upset with me. Sometimes he is happy. He has a strong character.&#8221; Pochettino added: &#8220;He is one of the best. I am pleased for him. He deserves it (to reach 100 goals). He is very professional, a top man and I m very happy. &#8220;This is not new for me. I ve said many times for me one of the best strikers in the world.&#8221; Stoke manager Mark Hughes, a former striker with Manchester United, Bayern Munich and Barcelona, added his voice to the praise directed Kane&#8217;s way. He said: He either takes chances or creates them or he s involved in the creation of chances, always involved at the sharp end. &#8220;There s great movement around him and that causes consternation. He benefits from that. He s in a good team and he s a good player and when it all clicks they re very difficult to stop.&#8221; Kane also set up Dele Alli for his side&#8217;s fourth goal as the midfielder delivered the ideal response after being sent off against Gent. Alli was heavily criticised for the first half challenge that brought a straight red card and the player admitted it had been a difficult 72 hours. He said: &#8220;It has been a difficult week for me. I felt horrible after the game in the week. I&#8217;m delighted to respond like this today. And his manager offered his full support for the 20-year-old. Our conversations are private but I gave more love than normal,&#8221; said Pochettino. &#8220;He s very mature and he showed that today. I am happy for him because he was sad and disappointed. He is only 20 years old. I will always protect and support him. &#8220;For me, he is one of the best young players in the world. I will always protect him. His character and the way he behaves, sometimes can make a mistake but I want him on the pitch and I want him next to me.&#8221; The win moved Tottenham up to second place and while the gap to leaders Chelsea remains a daunting ten points, Pochettino insists he has not given up hope of chasing down Antonio Conte s side. He said: &#8220;Ten points is a big gap, but we keep going and believe. We try to put on pressure.&#8221; Hughes was left frustrated at his side s display and demanded improvements ahead of Stoke s next game against Middlesbrough. He said: We ve been in decent form and need to get back. It s a big game against Middlesbrough and we need to be significantly better than we were. Spurs are a good side, give them credit. But every one of the goals (was) poor from our point view.&#8221;
