The National Planning Commission on Thursday applauded the parties involved in the agreement of the national minimum wage. The NPC said the introduction of the national minimum wage agreement and other measures to strengthen labour stability and collective bargaining is an important step in creating equality. It said this is a good step towards the National Development Plan vision 2030. The NPC secretary, Tshediso Matona said South Africa needed a trusted government and a good business environment to achieve its objective to eliminate poverty and reduce inequality. As highlighted in the NDP, the lack of trust between government and business and, in turn, between these sectors and labour movement, is a stumbling block towards faster economic development. This agreement shows that through persistence and hard work South Africans can find common cause to address and find solutions, Matona said. Achieving full employment, decent work and sustainable livelihoods depends on making tough choices. The ability to do this is a function of leadership among all social partners. This agreement shows the willingness by all parties to agreement to make these tough choices and find common ground in the interest of all South Africans.
