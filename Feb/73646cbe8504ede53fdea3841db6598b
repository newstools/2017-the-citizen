Idols SA judge and choreographer Somizi Mhlongo just got his Vitamin B shot and shem, like most of us, he was not happy. In a video shared by his fellow judge Unathi Msengana, Somizi can be seen walking out of the doctor&#8217;s room with his shorts pulled below his waist, showing part of his bum. He says he will never ever go through the pain that the doctor has just put him through. &#8220;Doctor, fuck you very much,&#8221; he said, much to the doctor&#8217;s amusement. Watch the hilarious video below: PG 18 as Somi getting Vitamin B shot by our Idols Doctor!!!! &#x1f602;&#x1f602;&#x1f602;&#x1f602; A post shared by Unstagram (@unathi.co) on Feb 27, 2017 at 3:30am PST
