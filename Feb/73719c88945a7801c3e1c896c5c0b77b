Rescue Care s operations director, Garrith Jamieson, confirmed that the taxi driver, who was seriously injured in the crash on the N3 opposite the Pavilion in KwaZulu-Natal on Friday, died in hospital on Saturday, reports the Highway Mail. This brings the death count to six, said Jamieson. Rescue Care paramedics responded to the scene just after 4pm on Friday. A truck had crashed into a fully-loaded taxi and squashed it into another truck. All 16 occupants of the taxi were entrapped in the wreckage. Rescue workers used the Jaws of Life and other hydraulic equipment to free the trapped passengers. This took close on an hour due to the severity of the incident. Once freed, it was established that five people had passed away due to the severity of their injuries. A further 14 people from both the taxi and trucks were treated, with most suffering serious injuries. The injured were transported to various Durban hospitals. The taxi driver succumbed to his injuries earlier today, added Jamieson.
