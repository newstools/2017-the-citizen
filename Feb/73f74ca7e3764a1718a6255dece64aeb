Nairobi. It is not in doubt that Kenyans are given to the last-minute rush.And on Tuesday, they did not disappoint when they flocked voter registration centres, hours to the expiry of the month-long listing.Armed with IDs, they thronged voter listing centres countrywide, with many spending hours in queues that had not been witnessed for the whole month.In Nakuru, the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) offices were a beehive of activity, with many residents seeking the green light to vote as others sought to transfer their polling stations.Paul Kones, the IEBC acting coordinator for the Central Rift region, said the number of eligible voters at listing centres shot up on Monday, with some stations doubling the numbers they were witnessing per day. For instance, Nakuru East recorded 1,400 people while Nakuru West had 1,200 up from an average of 600, Mr Kones said.So far, 236,585 people have registered in the Central Rift, with Nakuru County leading with 150,102 new voters.He, however, said the figure is below the region s target of registering 437,214 voters by the end of the campaign.Mr Kones maintained that the deadline would not be extended. At the end of the day today, we will pull our officials from the field. Tomorrow we will begin compiling the list before sending it to the IEBC headquarters in Nairobi for further compilation, Mr Kones said.There were long queues at registration centres in Nakuru, a stark contrast to the last 29 days when registration centres were virtually empty.Residents who spoke to Nation said they had other engagements.Paul Maina, a boda boda rider, said he had to get a licence for his motorbike before going to register.
