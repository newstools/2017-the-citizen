Apart from singer Kelly Khumalo and rapper Emtee, who decided to wear less clothing at the Metro FM Awards in Durban on Saturday night, there was a woman who had everyone shocked at her dress that left absolutely nothing to the imagination. Her name is Skolopad, and she is from the Free State. She is a singer and is known for her skimpy outfits. Though most on social media said her outfit was inappropriate, she said she was not ashamed of it. In fact, she specifically asked for her designer to make a dress that would expose her bum and make it look like she was not wearing panties, though she did wear a G-string, she told Daily Sun. The wore the dress that she called &#8220;the yellow naughty bum expose&#8221; to show that she was comfortable in her own skin and wished all young women would embrace their bodies. Skolopad posed for the cameras unashamedly and even pushed her dress further back to reveal what looked like a tattoo on her bum. Watch the video below: Yoh!
