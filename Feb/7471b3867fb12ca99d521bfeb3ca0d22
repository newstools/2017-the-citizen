Chris Morris on Sunday learnt the hard way that you always need to finish what you started in international cricket. The lanky Proteas seamer was the victim of New Zealand&#8217;s excellent fightback in the first ODI in Hamilton. Driven by a late assault by Colin de Grandhomme (34 off 19) and Tim Southee (24 from 13), the home side managed a competitive 207/7 in their permitted 34 overs. Play started 165 minutes late due to poor weather. It certainly didn&#8217;t seem that such a recovery would be possible after they slipped to 108/5. That was down to Morris, who varied his bowling well in his first two spells to pick up 4/24 in five overs. He had Dean Brownlie (31) and Neil Broom (2) caught through well-directed short balls, while bowling fast and straight to dismiss the dangerous Ross Taylor (1) and Tom Latham (0). But things well apart for the 29-year-old at the death as his wayward lengths got smacked for 38 runs in his last two overs. South Africa will hope it doesn&#8217;t cost them on a two-paced pitch that isn&#8217;t necessarily easy to bat on. Captain Kane Williamson was the mainstay of the early Black Cap batting effort as he stroked a fine 59 off 53 deliveries. His lack of support eventually put too much pressure on him as he cut a Tabraiz Shamsi (1/39) turner onto his stumps. The Proteas generally delivered a strange bowling performance. None of the attack in the end managed to keep the runs down except Kagiso Rabada. The brilliant quick clearly benefited from being rested in Friday&#8217;s T20 and looked his old self again with an excellent haul of 2/31 from his seven overs.
