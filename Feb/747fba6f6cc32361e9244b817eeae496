Valentine s Day is fast approaching, and while you re probably racking your brain over which restaurant to pick and what flowers she ll like best, don t forget that good style and grooming matter to her, too. Your date wants to be seen with a hunk so that she is proud to send selfies to her envious friends.Since Valentine s Day this year falls on a working day and with the hustle of traffic jams in the evening the best way to style up for the day would be to step out of the house looking good already.A corporate suit with a white shirt is ideal if you intend to step into a trendy spot later that evening. Make sure it has been taken to the dry cleaners in advance. The last thing you want is a cockroach creeping out of your jacket pocket while trying to whisper sweet words into her ear.If you intend to go for a romantic walk on the beach make sure your shoes are easy to take off and for goodness sake ensure your socks do not have holes.Remember subtle cologne is in order and do not empty the whole bottle in an attempt to impress. Last but not the least ensure that you have a couple of brand new handkerchiefs. They could come in handy when your date bursts into tears of joy.Otherwise sit back and enjoy the evening.Email: nk okutangilira@tz.nationmedia.com
