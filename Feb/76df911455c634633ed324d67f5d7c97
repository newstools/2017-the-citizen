The National Union of Mineworkers Youth Structure (NUM-YS) on Tuesday said it was concerned by Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane s continuous failure to assist workers at Lily Mine, saying his promises were a populist stunt . Mineworkers Solomon Nyerende, Pretty Nkambule and Yvonne Mnisi were buried alive when the lamp-room container in which they were working fell into a 60-metre sinkhole at the gold mine on February 5 last year. Their bodies have not been recovered. He promised to compensate the families of the trapped workers with R200 000 and those who were rescued R50 000 each. Since this populist stunt, he is nowhere to be found, said NUM-YS Highveld Region in a statement. The comments come soon after the NUM-YS 2nd Regional Youth Council meeting held at Eskom Park Lapa on the 24th of February 2017. The Council was joined by delegates from all sectors where NUM organises (Mining, Energy and Construction), YCL Provincial Secretary, eMalahleni Revenue and Youth Managers. The meeting discussed challenges facing young workers, inter alia eMalahleni Municipality Eskom Debt and retrenchments in mining. The NUM-YS called for Tshwane University of Technology (TUT) and Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) Colleges in Mpumalanga to consider aligning their curriculum with existing industrial needs. On job losses, NUM-YS noted that retrenchments were directly affecting young people. The Youth Structure calls for the Department of Mineral and Resources to urgently take action on the failures of mining companies to adhere to the Social Labour Plan in assisting the local communities, said NUM-YS. The Youth Structure wants to send a strong caution to Eskom and mining companies to refrain from haphazardly retrenching and brutality of management by abusing their executive powers.
