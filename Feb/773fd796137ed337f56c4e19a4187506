In the wake of xenophobic violence in Pretoria over that past weekend, notable leaders took to social media and other platforms to condemn the onslaught. Former SA reserve bank governor Tito Mboweni was also one of the leaders who condemned the onslaught on Africans. Mboweni, who was in the capital of Rwanda, Kigali, over the past weekend, said it felt good being an African in the city, which he said was &#8220;a clean city as always&#8221; and &#8220;very homely&#8221;. The former governor said &#8220;it feels good being African there&#8221;. But this was before he met a chef, who made Rwanda much hotter that he expected. The big man shed a tear in his right eye, apparently because of the hot chili that was put in his food by the Rwandan chef. &#8220;The chef put too much hot chilly in my food. Rwanda chilly,&#8221; said Mboweni. The chef put too much hot chilly in my food. Rwanda chilly. pic.twitter.com/lM7DNjo68u &mdash; Tito Mboweni (@tito_mboweni) February 25, 2017 The former reserve bank governor said no African was a foreigner in Africa. &#8220;Do not allow one African to call another a foreigner in Africa. We are Africans. Tomorrow, I am going to Rwanda. Feels good being African there. &#8220;These European &#8216;powers&#8217; sub-divided Africa amongst themselves. Today we have Portuguese, Spanish, French &amp; English speaking Africa. &#8220;And we willingly call each other &#8216;foreign nationals&#8217;. They have a European Union! My foot! We are Africans. We must love ourselves. AFRICANS. &#8220;Great to be back in Kigali, Rwanda. A clean city as always. It does indeed &#8216;feel good to be an African&#8217; here. Very homely.
