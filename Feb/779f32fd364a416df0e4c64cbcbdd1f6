An angry Bilic was sent off by referee Michael Oliver after throwing a television microphone in frustration following West Brom&#8217;s late equaliser in a 2-2 Premier League draw at the London Stadium. Bilic&#8217;s assistant, Nikola Jurcevic received the same charge from the FA, English football&#8217;s governing body, after previously complaining in the same match about a Hammers &#8216;goal&#8217; disallowed for offside. The West Ham duo now have until 1800 GMT on Thursday to respond to their respective charges. &#8220;West Ham United manager Slaven Bilic has been charged by the FA following the game against West Bromwich Albion on Saturday 11 February 2017,&#8221; said an FA statement issued Monday. &#8220;It is alleged that his behaviour in or around the 90th minute of the fixture amounted to improper conduct. &#8220;His assistant manager Nikola Jurcevic has also been charged for alleged misconduct following an incident in the 19th minute. &#8220;Both have until 6pm (1800 GMT) on 16 February 2017 to respond to their charge.&#8221; Bilic was adamant his side had repeatedly suffered from poor decisions by Oliver in a match where they came from behind to lead 2-1 only for the Baggies&#8217; Gareth McAuley to deny them victory with a stoppage-time header. Earlier in the game, Oliver decided against awarding West Ham a free-kick for a foul on Sofiane Feghouli in the build-up to Nacer Chadli&#8217;s opening goal for the Baggies, while Jurcevic was furious when Feghouli&#8217;s strike was ruled out for offside. &#8220;There were four or five decisions and all of them went totally against us. It&#8217;s building up your frustration,&#8221; said Bilic after the match. Both Bilic and Jurcevic could be given touchline bans, as well as fines, if found guilty of the charges. West Ham&#8217;s next match is away to Watford in the Premier League on February 25, before a London derby at home to Chelsea on March 6. The Hammers are currently 10th in the table, 12 points above the relegation zone.
