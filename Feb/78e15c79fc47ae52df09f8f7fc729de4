The recent rainy weather has left a lot of punters out in the cold with last week s Flamingo Park meeting cancelled due to the track being unsafe for racing. Looking at today s card, Muzi Yeni is the man to follow. He rides promising some mounts and I would advise not you to leave him out of your bets. He won five of the 10 races carded last time we were in Kimberley and history has a funny way of repeating itself. Muzi rides Miesque s Secret in Race 3, a FM Maiden Plate over 1800m. This daughter of Miesque s Approval has proven rather costly to follow. Over her last four starts she s finished second three times and third once. This could all change today; she s well drawn in stall No 6 and will shoulder 60kg. While she appears very hard to beat, she will have to get the better of Fortysecond Street who makes the trip down to Flamingo Park for the first time. She has decent form and KZN horses tend to flourish on the sand respect. Muzi makes for great Eachway bets in Race 5 aboard Secret Lover and Beach Bird in Race 9. Earlier he rides Dancingwithjackson in Race 6, a MR 72 Handicap over 1200m. This hat-trick hopeful left quite an impression last time out when winning by 6.75 lengths. He shoulders 53kg although stepping up in class and jumping from a wide No 8 draw should be the one they have to beat. Muzi also rides Cash In Camilla in Race 8, a FM 80 Handicap over 1400m. She returns from a rest but trainer Corrie Lensley will have kept her fit. Her Kimberley record is solid, having won once and placed twice. She shoulders 60kg and will have to overcome a wide No 10 draw but her class should tell. Muzi could close off the meeting with Roy s Dispren in Race 10. He produced a stellar performance in his Flamingo Park debut when winning by 4.50 lengths. Once again Muzi will have to overcome a wide No 13 draw with the positive being Roy s Dispren will shoulder a modest 57kg which should increase his chances.
