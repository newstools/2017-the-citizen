Just a week after bringing you the dynamic all-new Porsche Panamera 4S and Turbo models from Dubai, it is now the turn of the 4 E-Hybrid and the 4 Executive, along with the 4 E-Hybrid Executive and 4S Executive and Turbo Executive models to be introduced locally. We were invited down to the fairest Cape for the world launch of the extended range of Panamera models. . The Panamera 4 E-Hybrid benefits from the dynamics of the 918 Spyder super sportscar, while the Executive models, featuring a wheelbase that has been extended by 150mm, not only expand the body for the discerning businessman, but also extends the range of models offered. The Panamera 4 E-Hybrid delivers a winning combination of performance-oriented hybrid drive and sustainable e-mobility with dynamic sportiness and luxurious driving comfort. This GT, with the petrol-electric powertrain, is redefining the term balance in its own way: On the one hand, it boasts 340kW of system power, generated by the new 2.9-litre V6 biturbo engine and the electric motor. It also delivers a level of power that rivals that of a 911 Turbo: a torque of 700Nm is immediately available from the start. . This ensures driving pleasure and enables the Panamera 4 E-Hybrid to accelerate from 0-100km/ h in a claimed 4.6 seconds, thanks to the boost function. On the other hand, it has an electric range of about 50km, with an average fuel consumption of a 2.5-litres/100km in the New European Driving Cycle. This means you d have no real chance of achieving this figureunless you are using your 4 E-Hybrid in and around town most of the time. The new Panamera Executive models are highly luxurious versions of the Gran Turismo. They have a longer wheelbase, combining dynamic performance with outstanding comfort. With this long version, Porsche is satisfying the needs of customers who demand maximum space in the rear. All four models share a wheelbase that has been extended by 150mm, set to benefit passengers in the rear. The added space provides extra legroom. . In addition, all Executive models feature enhanced equipment levels. The standard equipment includes adaptive air suspension, a panoramic roof, electric comfort seats with comfort headrests in the rear, heated seats at the front and rear, as well as rear roll-up sun blinds. The Panamera 4S Executive and Panamera Turbo Executive feature a more comprehensive range of equipment as standard. Designed as a chauffeur-driven saloon, this longer wheelbase Porsche is available in the allwheel drive versions of Panamera 4 Executive at 243kW, Panamera 4 E-Hybrid Executive at 340kW, Panamera 4S Executive at 324kW and Panamera Turbo Executive at 404kW.
