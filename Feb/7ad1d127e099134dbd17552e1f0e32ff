A man is in a critical condition in a Durban hospital after being shot in Umhlatuzana Road in the Mariannhill area in Durban late on Friday night, KwaZulu-Natal paramedics said. Netcare 911 paramedics arrived at Umhlatuzana Road where the patient was brought to them on the back of a bakkie. After the patient was examined it was found that he sustained a life-threatening gunshot wound, Netcare 911 said in a statement. Paramedics stabilised the man at the scene and after he was placed on a ventilator they transported him to a Chatsworth hospital for the care that he required. Exact detail to the cause of the shooting and preceding events is still speculative and will form part of the police investigation, the statement said.
