To make up for putting her on blast to his 1 million Twitter followers last week, AKA has bought Bonang a luxury item an expensive Gucci bag to show he is remorseful. Bonang showed off her bag on Instagram, posting a video and saying she was so happy that AKA had even visited her at work to give her the gift. My heart can&#8217;t actually take it&#8230;. &#x1f629;&#x1f629;&#x1f629;&#x1f629;!! Thank you baby&#8230;. Love! Love! Obsessed!! Dying&#8230; Surprises at work even?!&#x1f62e;&#x1f648;&#x1f44c;I&#8217;m so spoilt&#8230; Thank you. &#x1f33a;&#x1f60d;&#x1f37e;&#x1f381;&#x1f389;&#x1f380; A post shared by Bonang Matheba (@bonang_m) on Feb 20, 2017 at 1:51am PST The Supa Mega appears to be in the dog box after he tweeted that he and Bonang were over. He said he had reached his limit with the bullsh*t and told men to never love their women more than they were loved. But he quickly retracted his tweets, apologising to Bonang and adding that couples fight. Bonang finally spoke out about the short-lived breakup, tweeting her man that things wouldn&#8217;t be the same. &nbsp; Well it seems all is well again between the two lovebirds and people can put their karma talk away.
