Following a 4-0 thrashing at the hands of Paris Saint-Germain in midweek, Barca needed a last minute Lionel Messi penalty to see off a Leganes side without a win since November and on their first ever league visit to the Camp Nou. Messi had given Barca a fourth minute lead, but jeers rang around the Camp Nou when Unai Lopez levelled 19 minutes from time. &#8220;As a fan, booing a player of your own team for me makes no sense,&#8221; said Enrique. Much-criticised midfielder Andre Gomes received the brunt of the boos as he was replaced 10 minutes from the end. &#8220;What can clearly help the team and the players is the support that we saw from the majority of the fans throughout the game and especially in the final minutes,&#8221; added Enrique. &#8220;That is what makes us stronger. Andre&#8217;s case annoys me.&#8221; However, the Barca boss said he had no such problem with criticism directed his way. &#8220;I am the coach and after the result and performance we saw in Paris it is logical. &#8220;I accept any criticism, but those on the pitch need to be in the best state possible. &#8220;The games are difficult enough as they are. If you add this on top of it, I don&#8217;t think it helps.&#8221; Victory ensured Barca moved back up to second in the table and to within a point of Real Madrid, who still have two games in hand. Barca face a much stiffer test next weekend when they travel to Atletico Madrid, but Enrique highlighted the psychological importance of getting the three points despite a poor display. &#8220;A slip-up today would have been almost definitive. Not in terms of points, but on an emotional level. &#8220;I am convinced that the team is going to improve and immediately.&#8221; The Spanish champions were thankful to a series of fine saves from Marc-Andre ter Stegen as he was unexpectedly busy to keep Leganes at bay. &#8220;It has been a difficult week for everyone without a doubt,&#8221; said the German. &#8220;The most important thing is that we were able to win today. That will give us a bit of confidence, which we need for the weeks ahead.&#8221; And Ter Stegen echoed his coach&#8217;s call for a show of unity from the Barcelona faithful. &#8220;Everyone that is on the field tried their best and I think the most important thing is to support us at times like we have had this week with the 4-0 defeat in Paris,&#8221; he added. &#8220;We need the fans, above all at home, to support us. &#8220;We can win or lose together, but the most important thing is that we are united.&#8221;
