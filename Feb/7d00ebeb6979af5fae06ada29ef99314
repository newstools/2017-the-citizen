Lesley Musina, who plays son of Albert Mukwevho, Ndalamo, is said to be leaving Muvhango after three years of gracing our TV screens. Musina, who plays a character that is blinded by love, according his on-screen sister Rendani, reportedly shot his last scene last week, and his last appearance on the soapie will be in May, reports Drum Magazine. Musina&#8217;s character will be written off, not killed, and will reportedly be replaced by an unnamed young upcoming actor. Musina told the publication that though Muvhango would always be his home, he felt he had to leave, as soapies gave a false sense of comfort. He said he had grown and needed to explore other parts of the entertainment industry. Though SABC 2&#8217;s Speak Out is his main focus right now, he said he was interested in radio presenting and being a DJ. Also read: Muvhango this week: A report reveals that Serithi killed Lerumo
