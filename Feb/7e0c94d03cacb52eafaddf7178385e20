Gospel legend Rebecca Malope was left heartbroken at Lundi Tyamara&#8217;s funeral in Worcester on Sunday after a fellow musician labelled her a &#8220;funeral specialist performer&#8221;. The musician, who Malope refused to name, made the snide comments after hearing that Malope was set to perform at Lundi&#8217;s funeral. She also performed at Sfiso Ncwane, David Masondo and Senzo Meyiwa&#8217;s funerals. According to The Sowetan, the musician went as far as saying it seemed as if Malope rejoiced every time a celebrity died, saying she used funerals as an opportunity to shine. Speaking to the publication, Malope said after Lundi died, she sent a message to his manager, Anele Hlazo, offering her assistance because the two were close. Though she was heartbroken, she still performed at the funeral because she had travelled to the Western Cape to bid farewell to her friend the best way she knew how.
