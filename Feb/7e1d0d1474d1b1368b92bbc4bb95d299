Sutton United, who play in English soccer&#8217;s fifth-tier, have already grabbed a few headlines by reaching the fifth-round of the FA Cup. That dream might&#8217;ve been ended on Monday night after they lost 2-0 to Arsenal but Wayne Shaw, their backup goalkeeper, has made sure they stay in the news. The 45-year-old, who weights a hefty 146kg, became an instant internet sensation after being caught eating a pie on Television during the second half of the game. Back-up keeper All three subs made Time for a pie Tuck in, Wayne Shaw! #EmiratesFACup pic.twitter.com/gjQWLzugVx &mdash; BT Sport Football (@btsportfootball) February 20, 2017 Paul Doswell, the Sutton manager, had just made his third and final substitution, prompting Shaw to chow down on his meaty feast. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think that puts us in the best of light,&#8221; an annoyed Doswell said afterwards. All the fun had turned sour by Tuesday evening. The club announced Shaw had left the club after the FA, England soccer&#8217;s governing body, confirmed it was investigating a case of him potentially engaging in illegal betting. SunBets, the betting platform for the daily The Sun, had offered 8-1 odds on Shaw &#8220;eating a pie at any stage during the match&#8221;. The shot-stopper admitted he knew of the offer but made a point of stating not him nor his teammates were involved. Name a more iconic duo, we&#39;ll wait&#8230; Wayne Shaw To Eat A Pie Live On Air = 8/1https://t.co/RbjPZpZ6NK #FACup #SUTARS pic.twitter.com/0YbfWbsHJh &mdash; Sun Bets (@SunBets) February 20, 2017 &#8220;A few of the lads said to me earlier on: &#8216;What is going on with the 8-1 about eating a pie? I said: &#8216;I don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;ve eaten nothing all day, so I might give it a go later on,&#8217; &#8221; he said according to various reports. &#8220;As I say what is that, Sun Bets had us at 8-1 to eat a pie. I thought I would give them a bit of banter and let&#8217;s do it. All the subs were on and we were 2-0 down.&#8221; Shaw&#8217;s subsequent departure make those words ring hollow. He also revealed he had taken the pie from the club kitchen during half-time and contained meat and potato. &#8220;I think there were a few people that placed a bet. Obviously we aren&#8217;t allowed to bet. I think a few of the mates and a few of the fans did,&#8221; said Shaw. &#8220;It was just a bit of banter for them.&#8221; However, the FA&#8217;s code of conduct is clear: a player should not instruct, permit, cause or enable any person to bet the result, progress, conduct or any other aspect of, or occurrence in, a football match or competition. Generally, it was an exciting night at Gander Green Lane, Sutton&#8217;s homeground. Flares were thrown, Arsenal fans attacked with bottles and there was a pitch invasion.
