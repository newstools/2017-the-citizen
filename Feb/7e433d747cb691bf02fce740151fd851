Acting national commissioner Lieutenant General Johannes Khomotso Phahlane filed papers with the North Gauteng high court registrar on Monday to institute a number of actions using convicted criminal Radovan Krejcir s past attorney, Piet du Plessis of BDK attorneys. On Sunday, Major General Prince Mokotedi told The Citizen he had met with Krejcir in Pretoria Central on 23 January at the request of Krejcir&#8217;s family. This, on top of allegations Phahlane was using a service provider to the police as an interior designer, which Phahlane has denied. Du Plessis withdrew as Krejcir s counsel in October 2015 after he had not received payment. Brigadier Sally de Beer confirmed Phahlane s legal team had issued and served an application in the Pretoria High Court. Please note that the intention of the High Court application is not to stop any investigation from continuing but to address specific issues to ensure that it is conducted lawfully within the constraints of specific legislation, De Beer said. The proposed court action targets Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) executive director Robert McBride, forensic consultant Paul O Sullivan, his lawyer Sarah-Jane Trent, and Magistrate JR Tsatsi. I ve been waiting for it, I m delighted to have received it, O Sullivan said. This will give me an opportunity to place in the public domain all the evidence I have gathered which implicates him in unlawful conduct. Ipid spokesperson Moses Dlamini said the organisation would defend itself if summons were served. Phahlane said McBride had allowed O Sullivan and Trent to participate in the investigations against him and also wanted the search warrant for his house issued by Tsatsi overturned. He also wants O Sullivan interdicted from harassing, intimidating or abusing, verbally or by email communication him. A date has still to be set.
