The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) said on Thursday that it was disappointed with the decision of the subsidiary company of Sibanye Gold to serve the Department of Mineral Resources (DMR) with a R26 million claim over Section 54 work stoppages. This comes after the DMR applied a number of Section 54 closures at Kroondal Platinum Mines in Rustenburg last year following a fatal accident in September. Sibanye Gold s subsidiary, Sibanye Platinum, argues that the DMR operated outside the scope of its authority by shutting down the mine. Sibanye Platinum said the DMR actions were misguided and wrongful , saying that it (Sibanye Platinum) had already taken reasonable measures to ensure the safety of its employees. In a statement, the NUM said it strongly condemned the behaviour of Sibanye Platinum. The union said it was of the firm view that Section 54 of the Mine Health and Safety Act was brought to life exactly for the reason that it had contributed to saving lives in the mining industry. There has been a consistent decline in the number of lives lost in the mining industry since 2008. According to the DMR, 77 lives were lost in 2015, while 76 people died in the mines in 2016. Peter Bailey, NUM s health and safety chairperson, said the Chamber of Mines had agreed that they were an organisation that respected the rules and laws, and they would never go against those laws and rules. We are urging the Chamber of Mines to intervene as a matter of urgency with its member and to then engage with the Department of Mineral Resources to discuss the elephant in the room rather than dispose of the baby with dirty bath water, Bailey said. The NUM unapologetically supports section 54 regulation and we would not ask for anybody s permission to defend Section 54 vigorously as the NUM. Bailey said the NUM would fight tooth and nail to defend Section 54 notices and fight any mining company that sacrificed mineworkers for profits. African News Agency (ANA)
