DJ Fresh, real name Thato Sikwane, has addressed rumours started by a fake Trevor Noah Facebook page alleging that he was a member of the illuminati. The article, titled &#8216;List of African stars accused of joining illuminati revealed&#8217;, named the DJ as one of the celebrities whose success was a result of their membership in the secret society. DJ Fresh has laughed off the rumour on Instagram and says he does not regard himself as an illuminati, but rather a khulumanathi (IsiZulu word for &#8216;speak to us&#8217;), for someone who was in radio.

Last year during the SAMAs, Luthando &#8216;Loot Love&#8217; Shosha and Nomuzi Mabena shared pictures of the two sitting next to each other with poses some of their followers said showed they were in the illuminati. &nbsp; &nbsp; A photo posted by Luthando Shosha (@lootlove2) on Jun 5, 2016 at 10:51am PDT
