When Lwazi Mvovo and Lionel Mapoe begin their Super Rugby campaigns with the Sharks and Lions respectively this weekend, they do so with a common goal. The Springboks&#8217; poor showing last season claimed numerous victims but none more so than these two provincial stalwarts. Also read: Why Lwazi Mvovo and the Sharks rookies need each other Mvovo got hammered by critics for his inability to catch a high-ball in the Test series against Ireland and was dropped. At least Mapoe managed to &#8220;survive&#8221; till the end of the season but coach Allister Coetzee could never settle on a partner for him. It also didn&#8217;t help that he couldn&#8217;t carry his play-making skills and decent defence over into international rugby. As a result, Mvovo and Mapoe are at a crossroad in their careers this year. In Mvovo&#8217;s case, time isn&#8217;t on his side as he turns 31 in 2017. But there&#8217;s an early opportunity for redemption for both this weekend. In Brisbane, where the Sharks face the Reds on Friday, Mvovo will be celebrating his 100th Super Rugby cap for the Durbanites. It&#8217;s the perfect way for him to forget about the trials of 2016, an occasion that demands him to focus on the present and building again towards the future. &#8220;It s all about taking care of home at this point in time and now the Sharks are home,&#8221; Mvovo said last month. &#8220;There s still a lot of rugby to be played and there s a lot that still has to happen. International rugby is only being played in June and I can t look that far ahead. I don t want to spoil what s brewing here.&#8221; Back in Doornfontein, Mapoe&#8217;s coach at the Lions, Johan Ackermann, has selected him on the right wing against the Cheetahs on Saturday. Also read: Lionel Mapoe: People are perhaps too harsh on us Springboks Currently it&#8217;s just a backup for the injured Ruan Combrinck but there are observers who believe Mapoe&#8217;s international future could rather lie on the wing. Ackermann certainly isn&#8217;t against the idea. &#8220;He&#8217;s a quality player with a lot of skill,&#8221; he said on Thursday. &#8220;The fact that he can slot in anywhere in the backline is proof of that. Lionel is one of the hard-working players on any field, that&#8217;s what makes him a good wing. The right wing in particular needs to took for work. It&#8217;s a good position for him.&#8221; South African rugby will certainly be watching with interest.
