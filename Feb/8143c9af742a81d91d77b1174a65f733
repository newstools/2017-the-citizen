Late gospel legend Sfiso Ncwane&#8217;s mother, Fikile Ncwane, has expressed concerns about the death of her son, saying she does not believe he was really sick. Fikile says she will not rest until she knows what and who killed her son because &#8220;he was killed&#8221;. She has further revealed to Drum that she spoke to Sfiso&#8217;s casket on the day of his funeral and told him to come back and fetch the person who killed him. Following his death, Fikile reportedly told the publication she had consulted many traditional healers to find out who killed him. She says her son responded by visiting his uncle and sister&#8217;s husband in dreams, telling them his spirit was still at the hospital where he died and wanted to go home. Now the family is preparing to travel to Johannesburg to &#8220;fetch his soul&#8221;. Fikile has further slammed her son&#8217;s wife, Ayanda, accusing her of telling doctors not to show her the postmortem report. She says she believes she has every right to know what killed her son. The Kulungile Baba hit maker died on December 5 at Fourways Life hospital after a short illness. According to a statement from the family, the illness started the night before he passed on at his Johannesburg home. He was then taken to hospital, where he was admitted and diagnosed with kidney failure and later moved to the intensive care unit. He unfortunately took his last breath at 09.30am Monday morning in the presence and arms of his loving wife Ayanda Ncwane. Also read: We ll always protect mommy for you, say Sfiso Ncwane s sons
