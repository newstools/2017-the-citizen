Four houses believed to be brothels were set alight, allegedly by angry community members, on Saturday afternoon in Rosettenville in Johannesburg. Community leaders this week called for brothels to be closed down and drug dens to be destroyed. A protester who declined to be named claimed police shot at peaceful demonstrators on Saturday. The very same people who are meant to protect us are the very same people who protect criminals, he said. Police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele said: The police came to disperse the people who were illegally gathered. They used rubber bullets and no one was injured. If anyone was shot by police they needed to report the matter to the nearest police station, he said.
