Last week it seemed Wayne Parnell was going to have an extended stay in the Proteas side. AB de Villiers, his one-day captain, did, after all, say he&#8217;s &#8220;done fantastically well&#8221;. But in Saturday&#8217;s third and &#8220;pink&#8221; ODI against Sri Lanka at the Wanderers, something bad happened &#8211; Dwaine Pretorius. Also read: Reckless Sri Lanka stung by AB de Villiers on buzzing &#8216;pink day&#8217; The Highveld Lions all-rounder, playing at his homeground, replaced his inconsistent teammate and ended with fine figures of 3/19. That&#8217;s not good news for Parnell. While he&#8217;s taken five wickets in the two matches he&#8217;s played in the series to date, the 27-year-old lacks the control of Pretorius&#8217; bowling. The national selectors can&#8217;t ignore that fact. South Africa&#8217;s bowling attack is currently loaded with strike bowlers in Kagiso Rabada, Chris Morris and Parnell. None of them naturally try to keep the runs down. Good international sides need a guy who turns off the tap and Pretorius is a man who&#8217;s perfected that art in franchise cricket. In fact, if ever there was a thinking man&#8217;s cricketer, it&#8217;s him. And he showed it at the Wanderers. &#8220;The Sri Lankan batters are really good if you give them width,&#8221; said Pretorius. &#8220;I tried to keep it tight and bowl at the top of off-stump. With the extra bounce in the wicket, it worked quite well. That&#8217;s the way it works at the Wanderers. If you&#8217;re going to be a bit more conservative in your line, the Wanderers&#8217; bounce will reward you.&#8221; But he doesn&#8217;t only follow his own rather sage advice. &#8220;AB told me to use my bouncer and I did. It worked well for some variety. I was glad he was there to advise me on that,&#8221; said Pretorius. De Villiers himself was very impressed.

It&#8217;s an open door to chat to him, I always like to work with bowlers like that.&#8221; Given that Pretorius&#8217; first-class batting average is 42 &#8211; 15 more than Parnell &#8211; he&#8217;s certainly a very creditable competitor for a place in the South African side. &#8220;My outlook on the game is simple. I try to do as well as I can when I get a chance. There aren&#8217;t many of them so you have to make them count,&#8221; said Pretorius. &#8220;Hopefully then, the rest will take care of itself.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
