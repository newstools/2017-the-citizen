Deputy speaker of the National Assembly Lechesa Tsenoli on Tuesday pleaded ignorance on enhanced security measures for the media ahead of President Jacob Zuma s State of the Nation address on Thursday. In a media briefing, Tsenoli was bombarded with questions about increased security and how it would affect the free movement of the media within the parliamentary precinct. There is no basis for the restrictions of media as has happened in the past, unless there is extraordinary reasons that have not come to our attention, he said. My view is that we should take on board the responsibility for ensuring that your freedom is allowed. We undertook that that will not be tampered with.

I don t know where the idea of the media square comes from, he said, adding that he was hopeful there would be a disruption-free Sona, despite havoc being displayed in the National Assembly over the past two years. I m always an optimist about things turning out well, and if they don t, we are ready for it. The parliamentary Press Gallery Association (PGA) expressed concern that journalists would be limited from carrying out their duties, that police would be deployed to act as escorts , and that if disruptions did occur during Zuma s speech, journalists movements would be restricted. Tsenoli was also asked about who was footing the bill for the Speaker s Ball on Thursday, but could not give an answer. I have no clue who funds it.
