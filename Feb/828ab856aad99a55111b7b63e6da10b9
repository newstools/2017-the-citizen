You have to feel for Sri Lanka on Saturday as they enter the pink one-day international against the South African cricket team at the Wanderers. The visitors were thumped 3-0 in the Test series, fought back to win the T20 series against an experimental Proteas side, and now trail 2-0 in the five-match one-day international series. They have to win on Saturday to stay alive in the series. It won t be easy in front of a sellout crowd. South Africa s record in the pink match is flawless. Since the maiden pink match against Pakistan in 2013, the Proteas have not only won all four encounters, but done so with sublime performances. Hashim Amla and AB de Villiers have scored two hundreds in the four matches over the years as South Africa have romped to wins over Pakistan, India, the West Indies and England. Who will ever forget De Villiers heroics against the West Indies in 2015 when he slammed 16 sixes and nine fours on his way to a 44-ball 149 after bringing up his century in just 31 balls the fastest one-day international hundred? Or Chris Morris gutsy half century batting at number eight to guide the Proteas to an unlikely victory against England last year? It s made even more special as it s all for a wonderful cause with this fixture already raising well over R2 million in aid of breast cancer awareness over the years. Bring on the boundaries.
