W deepest regret I must confirm that dear friend &amp; major #Noseweek contributor #BarrySergeant died on Sat 4Feb.

He spent the last few years of his life farming in the Eastern Free State, battling with cancer which required invasive surgery in 2013 &#8230; he was a good friend, but more importantly, one of those more rare of our species, an honourable man &#8230; For everyone who believes that democracy relies on the twin pillars of a free press and free courts, his loss is immeasurable.&#8221; Today would have been his birthday. Many others took to social media to share their memories of Sergeant and express their condolences. I&#39;m deeply saddened by the passing of courageous journalist Barry Sergeant. The man was a fearless scribe. May his soul rest in peace. &mdash; Jobe SC Sithole (@Jobza) February 6, 2017 May #BarrySergeant, whose business card was as extraordinary as he, fly in peace. pic.twitter.com/bdKb4hnauZ &mdash; Stefaans Br mmer (@StefaansB) February 7, 2017 We mourn the loss of investigative journalist @BarrySergeant.
