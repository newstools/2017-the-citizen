The MEC for Social Development in KwaZulu-Natal, Weziwe Thusi, on Wednesday welcomed the sentence imposed on a church bishop found guilty of masterminding the murder and mutilation of Thandazile Msweli, an albino from Mhlabuyalingana. Zion Church Bishop, Bhekukufa Gumede, was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment in the Mtubatuba High Court in northern KwaZulu-Natal on Tuesday, for his part in the murder. Gumede was pointed out by three men already convicted for the crime as the man who hired them to kill Msweli and remove her body parts to make umuthi (traditional medicine). The court heard Gumede personally removed Msweli s private parts and hand to make umuthi which he said would make him rich.

We are particularly happy about the sentence imposed on Gumede because it shows that as a society we will not stand for the torture and murder of people with albinism. We hope the sentence will also provide some comfort to people with albinism and show them that a crime against them is a crime against us all and it will be punished severely. I would like to remind our people that people with albinism are human beings like the rest of us and their body parts have no magic powers. They cannot make anyone rich. Our people must not be misled by rogue elements seeking to make a quick buck. Thusi said they hoped that the sentences imposed on Gumede and his accomplices would serve as a deterrent.
