Democratic Alliance chief whip John Steenhuisen on Wednesday, accused Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga of trying to contrive a complaint of unethical conduct against DA MP Gavin Davis to conceal problems with the matric result standardisation process. Calling Motshekga s complaint that Davis had leaked classified information in raising objections to the methodology followed by Umalusi flimsy and fatuous , he said the DA would be happy to defend a charge in whatever forum she chose to raise it. Motshekga had threatened to report Davis to Parliament s ethics committee. Her complaint included his refusal to sign a confidentiality agreement when he attended the National Standardisation meeting in December, where Umalusi, the Quality Council for General and Further Education and Training, and the department discussed the 2016 matric results and tweeting a picture of the event. Following the meeting, Davis penned an open letter to the CEO of Umalusi, Mafu Ramoketsi, in which he questioned the upward adjustment of marks in 28 subjects. To sum up, there is reason to believe that the standardisation process may lead to an artificial inflation of the matric marks this year, he wrote. Davis added that the upward adjustment would not be a problem in and of itself if it could be demonstrated that these adjustments were effected due to the increased cognitive demand of the exam papers , but that there was no evidence to this effect. Davis said last week that he had done nothing wrong and would in fact have failed in his oversight duties as an MP if he had not raised his concerns about the process. Steenhuisen said he fully backed this view. African News Agency For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
