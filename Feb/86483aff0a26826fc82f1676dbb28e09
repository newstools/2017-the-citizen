The bursaries are offered to both matriculants applying to higher education institutions in South Africa as well as students currently completing tertiary qualifications in programmes such as pharmacy, chartered accounting, logistics and industrial engineering, IT, hospitality, retail business management and professional cookery. Candidates may qualify for a bursary of up to R70,000, depending on the course of study and institution, which allows for tuition, books and accommodation. Additionally, each of the bursaries is linked to work-back agreements with the Shoprite Group, giving students the boost they need to kick-start a great career. As South Africa s largest private sector employer with over 140,000 employees, the Shoprite Group recognises the value of investing in opportunities for young people to obtain a qualification and acquire the necessary skills for gainful employment. The Group has already created more than 2,700 opportunities to the value of over R110 million for students since its bursary programme was initiated over two decades ago. The retailer has increased its support to students in line with demand for access to tertiary education over the past few years, and is looking to fill close to 300 study opportunities for the 2017 academic year.
