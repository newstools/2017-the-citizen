Tabloid Sunday World has reported on further details around the sad end of gospel star Lundi Tyamara, who passed away this month and was still being remembered at his funeral on Sunday in Worcester. Despite the fact that Lundi was a commercial success and is understood to have enjoyed high album sales, he was reportedly evicted from the townhouse he had been renting in Mondeor, Johannesburg. The owner confirmed to the tabloid that he had sold the house in December and the new owner was in a hurry to take occupation. According to Sunday World, Tyamara needed to borrow R950 from a friend to pay a storage fee for furniture. The friend reportedly said that the singer &#8220;complained that Anele Hlazo, who was his manager, was the reason he was broke.&#8221; Hlazo told the tabloid he was only willing to offer his side of what had happened between himself and Lundi after the funeral.
