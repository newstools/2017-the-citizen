A woman was killed and three men were seriously injured when two cars collided head-on on the N12 near Fochville in Gauteng on Saturday, paramedics said. Shortly after 12pm, paramedics from ER24 arrived on the scene where they found one of the cars in the middle of the road and the other in a ditch on the side of the road, ER24 spokesman Werner Vermaak said. A woman with fatal injuries was found next to one of the cars. It was believed that she was ejected from the car during the collision. There was nothing that could be done for her and she was declared dead on the scene. Three men were found trapped in the vehicles. Paramedics managed to extricate them and treat them for their serious injuries. They were later transported to nearby hospitals. The circumstances surrounding the collision are not yet known. However, it is believed that the wet road conditions might have been a contributing factor. The police will be investigating the cause, Vermaak said. African News Agency (ANA)
