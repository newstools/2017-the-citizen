The African National Congress (ANC) on Monday described statements made by its Youth League president, Collen Maine, at the weekend that Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan is impimpi (spy) as reckless and regrettable . The party s spokesperson, Zizi Kodwa, told News24 something must be done regarding the youth leader after reports that he accused Gordhan of being a spy for white monopoly capital at KwaZulu-Natal s provincial elective conference in Durban. Maine reportedly told delegates attending the conference how izimpimpi were dealt with during the struggle for freedom in the country. Those regarded as spies in those times were often necklaced for selling out their fellow comrades. The statement is reckless and regrettable. To attack a minister appointed by President Jacob Zuma is out of line. Only the president can take decisions on his ministers, Kodwa told the news website. He said no structure of the ruling party should use such a term for Gordhan. It is completely out of order and irresponsible. We think there is everything wrong with that statement, politically. The ANC at some point will talk to him and get clarity. We are looking forward to meeting with him and getting clarity on this statement. The ANC spokesperson also said President Jacob Zuma had the prerogative to appoint ministers to his Cabinet, saying the party was deeply concerned about what Maine said at the Durban conference. It is worrying to use the word impimpi in the same line as Minister Gordhan. Gordhan is a cadre of the ANC. He knows nothing else but the ANC. It cannot be suggested that he comes from somewhere else. We will constantly remind people Dlamini-Zuma is a woman leader ANCWL For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
