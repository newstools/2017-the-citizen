All roads led to Durban this past weekend for the #MMA16. The world of music got together to celebrate all the musicians who worked hard in the previous year. Our local celebs brought some of their best outfits to the black carpet. It was a great night for a lot of artists, more especially new kid on the block Nasty C who won three awards. The ceremony was hosted Metro FM DJs, Pearl Modiadie and Amon Mokoena. Probably the biggest talking point on the night was Riky Rick s controversial speech.

Share with us some of your biggest highlights on the night.
