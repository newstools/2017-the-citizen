If there&#8217;s one player that is a perfect example of the Kings&#8217; rocky journey in Super Rugby, it&#8217;s Siyanda Grey. South African rugby needs to be honest about the embattled Eastern Cape franchise&#8217;s prospects in 2017: they do look rather bleak. Yet despite essentially everything being stacked against the Kings, there is a sense that they start this campaign on a blank canvas. Unlike 2016, the liquidation of the Eastern Province Rugby Union didn&#8217;t rumble in the background. Contracting didn&#8217;t drag on until the season had started. Heck, the Kings actually had a relatively normal pre-season schedule. Also read: SA&#8217;s best hope: The Lions squad dissected Grey has been at the franchise since their first campaign in 2013. Most of his teammates have moved but the 27-year-old utility back, who has been plagued by injuries, has stayed. He wants to make up for lost time, start on his own blank canvas. &#8220;The only goal I ve set for myself is to get game time,&#8221; said Grey. &#8220;My only wish is to be injury-free this season. That is the focus for me right now.&#8221; It sounds painfully simple but when you&#8217;re part of the Kings, you don&#8217;t (and possibly can&#8217;t afford to) have unrealistic goals. Because when a side is put in a merciless position like the men from Port Elizabeth, the slightest semblance of stability is good enough. &#8220;I can t compare last year to this year because we had difficulties last year, but this year everything is in place, and we are looking good,&#8221; said Grey. We are focusing on this year and we have prepared well for the year, and it has been really good so far.&#8221; Even the appointment of veteran prop Schalk Ferreira as captain on Thursday is an indication that the Kings aren&#8217;t in as much strife as some doomsayers believe. After all, not many would bet a 33-year-old looshead with experience in France would be happy in the Bay. &#8220;Schalk is a great ambassador for the franchise. He s an experienced Super Rugby player that wore the Kings jersey through different campaigns and battles with pride and honour,&#8221; said Deon Davids, head coach. &#8220;He worked extremely hard during the off-season and was a good example for young and old players. He stood out as a natural leader.&#8221; The Kings on Thursday also revealed their home kit for the season.
