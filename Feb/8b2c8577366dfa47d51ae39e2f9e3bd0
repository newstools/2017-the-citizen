This Trippi gelding will have top-weight but comes into the race well weighted, 1kg in with stable companion Ashton Park and better off with the balance of the field. Night Trip was runner-up behind Highway Explorer over an inadequate 1000m on the Polytrack in November and recently was third behind the fast improving Amazon King. This longer distance suits him better and it is noteworthy that Anton Marcus will be aboard the seven-year-old. The Gareth van Zyl yard is ticking along nicely and Budapest is sure to prove a danger as the Lithuanian gelding likes this track. Ashton Park has been disappointing recently but is clearly not out of it. In a competitive Race 5, a MR 70 Handicap over 1400m, we could get a decent run from Roy s Stormer. There was a lot to like about the way this Muhtafal colt quickened up when shedding his maiden tag
