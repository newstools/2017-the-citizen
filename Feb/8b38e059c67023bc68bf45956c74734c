British newspaper The Sun claimed Martial, 21, could join Paris Saint-Germain at the end of the season after struggling to convince manager Jose Mourinho of his worth. But the France international told his close to 800,000 Twitter followers: &#8220;Dont listen (to) the papers it&#8217;s wrong thanks. Come on United.&#8221; Martial joined United from Monaco in September 2015 in a deal with a reported potential worth of up to 58 million ($72 million, 67 million euros). He was United&#8217;s top scorer last season with 17 goals in all competitions, but has found the net only six times this season and has not featured in the club&#8217;s last three Premier League games. Mourinho hit out at Martial and his entourage in December after the player&#8217;s agent, Philippe Lamboley, said the former Lyon youngster was a target for Sevilla. &#8220;Anthony has to listen to me and not his agent,&#8221; Mourinho said. &#8220;With Martial, every day I read the newspaper. &#8216;Martial goes to Sevilla&#8217;, &#8216;Martial goes on loan&#8217;, &#8216;Martial is not happy&#8217;. Martial has to listen to me. He is a player with amazing conditions to be a top player.&#8221;
