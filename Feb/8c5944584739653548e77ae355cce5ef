The first step to remedying the ills of South African rugby &#8211; specifically the Springboks &#8211; will happen on Friday. That&#8217;s when the South African Rugby Union (Saru) are expected to announce changes to Bok coach Allister Coetzee&#8217;s support staff. But it&#8217;s not enough. For South Africa to become a powerhouse in an increasingly competitive environment, they need another thing: co-operation. And that&#8217;s something local rugby is depressingly poor at. Also read: Johan Ackermann: I&#8217;m not going anywhere Saru last year hosted a ground-breaking coaching indaba, where the countries top coaches had a frank discussion about how to work better together. Resources are, after all, becoming thinner by the month. The talk sounds promising but now there needs to be walk too. At the moment though, that&#8217;s enough for Lions captain Warren Whiteley to stay positive. &#8220;I&#8217;m always optimistic about our rugby,&#8221; the Springbok eighthman said on Thursday. &#8220;You can go watch rugby at school level and you&#8217;ll realise there&#8217;s so much talent. We&#8217;re so fortunate that we keep on producing fine players.&#8221; Yet he does admit national structures need to change their attitude. &#8220;There are definitely structural issues. But I&#8217;m confident we can resolve them and move forward,&#8221; said Whiteley. &#8220;The coaching indaba was encouraging. South African rugby took steps towards working as a collective. Ultimately, that&#8217;s what&#8217;s going to improve us as a rugby nation. &#8220;We need to be able to share ideas with each other, not hide them. It can become difficult but we don&#8217;t have another choice.&#8221; His coach, Johan Ackermann, agrees the Boks should be better equipped this year. &#8220;There were some real positives to come out of the indaba,&#8221; he said. &#8220;For the first time, our conditioning coaches sat in a room and worked out a plan to keep the players fit and fresh. Allister will also tell us who&#8217;s in his plans, so we&#8217;ll improve those players in the areas the Boks have identified.&#8221; But, in the end, Saru still has little control over players that aren&#8217;t nationally contracted. That means self-interest might always rear its head again. &#8220;For now, we&#8217;re in control of the players&#8217; conditioning and development. There are national camps planned but we&#8217;re still responsible for most of our players,&#8221; said Ackermann. &#8220;Yet I&#8217;m sure the unions can add value to the national side.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
