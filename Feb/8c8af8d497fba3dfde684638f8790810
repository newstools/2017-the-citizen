Connie and Shona Ferguson have a love story that has left some of us believing couples can work together successfully. The couple has shared a few pointers on how they make it work at home and the workplace. In videos shared by Khanyi Dhlomo, Connie says though some might find working with their partner impossible, she finds it easier because she loves her husband as a friend. &#8220;For us it&#8217;s very simple, we love each other as friends. I mean this dude here is like my best friend, when I say my best friend, I mean, forget the love, forget the marriage. I mean, I can love Shona about everything and anything.&#8221; It&#8217;s all about having a soul connection, she says. The connection was what attracted her to him, though Shona says it was love at first sight.
