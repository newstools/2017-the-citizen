Russell Domingo admits the timing of the announcement that his Proteas coaching position is being advertised is &#8220;disappointing&#8221;. Cricket South Africa (CSA) controversially buried that detail deep in a press release regarding the restructuring of provincial cricket two weeks ago, leading to a significant outcry. Also read: Coach hunt doesn&#8217;t mean there&#8217;s no faith in Russell Domingo Yet &#8211; given that there were calls for him to be fired less than a year ago &#8211; the 42-year-old mentor knows it&#8217;s far better to be philosophical about these type of matters. &#8220;There s never a good time to advertise a coaching position I suppose,&#8221; Domingo said Friday night after the Proteas clinched a clean-sweep in the one-day series against Sri Lanka. &#8220;But the board s got processes they need to follow. They need to do what they feel is in the best interest of the national cricket team. &#8220;They ve got to make decisions like I have to make regarding selection, strategy and tactics. I ve got to do what I feel is best for the team, they need to do what they feel is best for cricket. So be it, I don t have to always agree or disagree or love it. It is what it is.&#8221; Following the announcement, CSA confirmed Domingo would be &#8220;more than welcome&#8221; to re-apply for his job. That&#8217;s not necessarily a dangling carrot for him. In fact, he took a leaf out of his ODI captain AB de Villiers&#8217; book &#8211; who isn&#8217;t sure about playing Test cricket again &#8211; in being non-committal about submitting his CV again. Also read: Bye bye Russell Domingo? &#8220;I need to think about it. There s still a lot of water that needs to run under the bridge. Guys are talking about the Champions Trophy but that s still about five months away. Our focus is entirely on the New Zealand series,&#8221; said Domingo. &#8220;It s always been my method not to look too far ahead and take it one series at a time. I need to weigh up where I am in my life, where I am with my family and where I am in my career. At this stage, I m not able to commit or not.&#8221; What South African cricket can be assured of though is that Domingo doesn&#8217;t need an axe over his head as motivation to continue being passionate about his team. &#8220;I don t think I need the coaching advertisement as motivation to keep doing my job to the best of my ability. It s not about me, it s about the team being motivated,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It s the players that deserve the accolades because they are the ones that put in the hours on the field.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.I
