Dar es Salaam. Azam FC are sweating over prospects of using their Ghanaian midfielder Enock Agyei in the Confederation Cup.The attacker, who joined the Chamazi Street moneybags in the summer, has yet to secure an International Transfer Certificate (ITC) owing to being underage.Azam submitted the name of Agyei to Caf for the Confederation Cup, but the African soccer governing body did not sanction the Ghanaian, citing transfer irregularity.However, the former Medeama FC player turned 18 last month, something which gives his employers hope that Caf will reverse its decision.The Chamazi side will take on the winner of the Opara United (Botswana) and Mbabane Swallows (Swaziland) between April 7 and 9, and the second leg will take place between April 14 and 16.Opara United and Mbabane Swallows clash in the preliminary round this weekend before meeting in the decisive return leg between March 17 and 19.Tanzania Football Federation (TFF) Information Officer Alfred Lucas said all Azam players were sanctioned by Caf with the exception of Agyei. All other Azam players have been issued with licenses for the forthcoming Confederation Cup with the exception of Agyei, said the TFF spokesman. He was underage when Azam submitted his name, but he has already reached the right age to sign a professional contract. We have already informed Azam over this, so we hope they will be racing against time to have him on board. Azam FC information officer Jaffer Idd said they were already working on the matter, disclosing that club s chief executive officer Saad Kawemba had already flown to Ghana to put the saga to rest. When we submitted his name, he was 17 years old, but he now 18, so we are working on this and hopefully Enock will be eligible for the Confederation Cup, he said.Meanwhile, the club has received a huge boost after defender Shomari Kapombe and midfielder Salum Abubakar returned to full training yesterday.Idd revealed that John Bocco and Stephane Kingue were still nursing injuries, stressing that they may be fit within a week.
