It turns out losing now and then isn&#8217;t a bad thing. The Proteas on Saturday quickly recovered from a narrow loss earlier in the week as they thrashed New Zealand by 159 runs in the third ODI in Wellington. They lead the five-match series 2-1. Neil McKenzie, South Africa&#8217;s batting coach, had said the side were still aiming to deliver a complete performance and this came pretty close. Despite a mid-innings wobble, the Proteas&#8217; varied bowling attack was absolutely outstanding in ripping the home side&#8217;s batting to shreds. Dwaine Pretorius, who is rapidly trying to make himself look indispensable, took 3/5 in 5.4 overs as the Black Caps were shot out for 112 but it was definitely a team effort. Kagiso Rabada (2/39), back after being rested with a knee niggle, worked up good pace and combined well with a disciplined Wayne Parnell (2/33) as the new ball pair. Yet it was the all-rounders Pretorius and Andile Phehlukwayo (2/12) that struck the killer blows. Phehlukwayo kept it tight to New Zealand captain Kane Williamson (23) and forced the out-of-sorts stroke-maker to chop a cut unto his stumps. Four balls later, Pretorius&#8217; line trapped Ross Taylor (18) &#8211; South Africa&#8217;s destroyer in Christchurch &#8211; in front. Thereafter, it was all one-way traffic as the Proteas exploited favourable conditions under the lights and fully justified AB de Villiers&#8217; decision to bat first. In fact, South Africa&#8217;s skipper had a fabulous game. Since his return to international cricket, De Villiers hadn&#8217;t quite convinced yet with his batting form. Yet when he delivered at a crucial juncture. Quinton de Kock (68) and Faf du Plessis (36) gave South Africa a fine start but the middle-order struggled again as five wickets were lost for 66 runs. The moment of crisis brought out the best in De Villiers, who crafted a brilliant 85 off 80 balls and became the fastest player to reach 9000 ODI runs &#8211; 205 innings. He received excellent support from Parnell. The mercurial bowling all-rounder showed sound judgement in his knock of 35 off 32 as the pair added 84 runs in 10.4 overs for the 7th wicket. It proved vital. For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
