If you spent a lot of money trying to please your partner with flowers on Valentine&#8217;s Day, you need to take a few lessons from musician Penny Penny. The musician seems to have mastered the art of treating his woman without spending a cent. He&#8217;s still married to her, so clearly it works. On his reality show on Wednesday night, Penny Penny gave viewers a few pointers on how to spoil their partner and keep the fire burning. The first lesson: &#8220;You have to keep them happy.&#8221; This, according to Penny Penny, should be every man&#8217;s goal in a relationship. When you surprise her and make her happy, you add more life and love, says the musician. &#8220;Women need to be treated like eggs. If you drop an egg, it&#8217;s broken.&#8221; Penny Penny, does, however, admit that sometimes couples lose the spark, but that&#8217;s not the end. If it happens, &#8220;do something for her,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Having a wife at home is not just about love anymore, it&#8217;s about family. When you bring a woman into your home, she becomes your everything.&#8221; To spoil his wife, Penny Penny cooked pap, garlic chicken, spaghetti and mince meat for her, something that really surprised her. He gave her a taste of &#8220;papa spice&#8221; in his chicken and her favourite chocolate. However, there were no flowers. He said he didn&#8217;t give her flowers because he was &#8220;the original flower&#8221;. This is how Twitter reacted to his lovely gesture: #Papapennyahee the love I hv for papa penny. He&#39;s authentic. Preparing valentines dinner for wife. Fanta grape 2litre and all.
