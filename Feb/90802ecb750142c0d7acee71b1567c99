A 33-year-old attorney appeared in the Welkom Magistrates&#8217; Court on Monday charges of corruption, defeating the administration of justice and aiding an escape. Pule Patrick Mile, the defence attorney of nine illegal immigrants who had been sentenced to eight months&#8217; imprisonment, was arrested on Friday. In a statement on Monday, Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (Hawks) spokesperson Captain Philani Nkwalase said: He allegedly sped off, despite the attempts made by a police officer to apprehend two of the nine illegal immigrants allegedly seen leaving Welkom Magistrates&#8217; Court on 27 January 2016 in his vehicle. But the police officer, who allegedly facilitated the getaway, brought the suspects back the same day. Nkwalase said: Upon their return, Sergeant Tumelo Daniel Lehokoe, 33, was arrested, and he appeared before Welkom Magistrates&#8217; Court on 30 January 2017. They were both released on R3 000 bail and are both expected to appear in Welkom Magistrates&#8217; Court on 28 February 2017, he said.
