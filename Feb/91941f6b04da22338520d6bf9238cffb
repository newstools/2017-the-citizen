Ashleigh Moolman-Pasio bounced back in style on Thursday, charging to victory in her first race back from injury to secure her fourth national time trial title at the SA Road Cycling Championships in Wellington. The Commonwealth Games bronze medalist, who had lost her crown due to illness last year and was later sidelined by a hip injury after crashing in September, returned to form to reclaim the SA title. She covered the distance more than three minutes faster than her nearest competitor. &#8220;It&#8217;s awesome to win the title back,&#8221; Moolman-Pasio said. &#8220;I actually haven&#8217;t really been on the time trial bike after the injury last year and I just realised how at home I feel on the time trial bike.&#8221; Meanwhile, fellow Olympian and World Road Cycling Championships team time trial bronze medalist Daryl Impey also secured a convincing victory. Impey was nearly two minutes clear of his nearest competitor in the elite men&#8217;s time trial, former 947 Cycle Challenge winner Willie Smit, who earned the silver medal. Stefan de Bod was second quickest over the course, though he did not qualify for the elite division, securing victory in the Under-23 category.
