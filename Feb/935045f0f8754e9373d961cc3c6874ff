Live lobsters worth R250 000 were seized in Cape Town this week because of contraventions to the Marine Living Resources Act, Western Cape police said. Members of border police, the agriculture, forestry, and fisheries department (DAFF), and the customs service dog unit conducted inspections on perishable consignments at the South African Airways (SAA) cargo section as part of operation Thunder Bird , Captain FC van Wyk said. Two consignments were stopped because their original export permits were not on the premises of SAA cargo. The contents of the two consignments were live lobsters destined for Hong Kong via Johannesburg. The two consignments were seized by members of DAFF and the live lobsters were booked in as exhibits. The lobsters are being kept at the SAA cool rooms because they are live crustaceans. The permit holder was notified of the seizure of their products at SAA cargo. An inquiry docket was opened for further investigation into who will be held responsible for the permit violation. The charge reads as follows: Living Marine Resources Act 18 of 1998 section 5.2 No Export Permit 27 (1) (f). The two consignments contained approximately 270 lobsters weighing 819kg . This seizure sent out a clear message to companies who export our living marine resources to abide by the law, Van Wyk said. African News Agency (ANA)
