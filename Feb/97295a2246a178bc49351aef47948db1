He then went to the bedroom to join his girlfriend, Ms Kelebogile Kwababa, now deceased. It was further alleged that after a short while, his flatmates heard the deceased screaming for help. A witness went to investigate, knocked on the door and no one opened for him. While the witnesses were standing outside the bedroom, they heard three gunshots coming from the bedroom. Dlamini said after a while, the accused had come out from his bedroom carrying a gun and instructed the witnesses to stand back. The paramedics and the police were called and the deceased was certified dead at the crime scene.
