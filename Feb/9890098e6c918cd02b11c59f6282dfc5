KwaZulu-Natal golfer Martin Rohwer backed up a superb eagle at Killarney Country Club s 15th with three straight pars to collect his first IGT Challenge Tour trophy in the Race to Q-School series on Thursday. The 23-year-old rookie from Kloof posted the low round of the day a four-under-par 66 in the 15th event of the Sunshine Tour Prep Series to close out a one shot victory on seven under over seasoned campaigner Coert Groenewald. Rohwer began the last day two off the pace, but closed the gap on joint overnight leader Dean O&#8217;Riley with a pair of birdies at the second and seventh. He edged ahead briefly with a birdie at 10, but gave the shot back at 11 when he leaked his tee shot right into the trees. A brief look at the on-course leaderboard at 15 sparked a great drive that flew straight down the middle of the par five and a superb seven iron into the green set Rohwer up for his maiden breakthrough. I hit a cracking tee-shot and the distance was just perfect, he said. I left myself a six footer for eagle and boxed the putt. Coert had the lead at six under, but the eagle gave me the lead. I thought he would make a birdie over the last three holes, so I played conservatively, although I hoped to pick up at least one more birdie. When I got 18, I saw he finished at six under, so I just made sure that I got the par for the win. It s such a great feeling to get a win under the belt with Q-School just four weeks away. This is what I ve been building towards for the last eight months. Rohwer began competing on the country s premier golf development circuit after he graduated the University of Alabama at Birmingham last year. He credits Shaun Coetzee for his victory. I started working with Shaun at the Institute of Elite Golfers at Kloof Country Club about two months ago and I really feel his has helped me reach this point, said Rohwer. My overall game is a lot more consistent, but I am also mentally better equipped and a stronger on the golf course. It s nice to see some positive outcomes from the work we ve been doing and hopefully I can keep building on this over the last three Race to Q-School events.
