Dar es Salaam. Embattled CUF chairman Ibrahim Lipumba yesterday pledged to respect court decision even if it won t be in his favour.He was speaking during a programme by a local TV station where he said in case the court decides that he was to step down, he would comply immediately. I ll respect decisions of the court, although it s shameful for a senior political party like CUF to end its disputes through the court of law .Prof Lipumba said he believed dialogue was the best was to resolve the ongoing wrangle, saying the expertise of CUF secretary general Seif Sharif Hamad could make valuable contribution. He led party s team in reaching a political reconciliation agreement with CCM in 2001 following the post-election violence in Zanzibar. Using such experience, the dispute could peacefully, he said.Last year, party s board of trustees filed a case against the Registrar of Political Parties, Judge Francis Mutungi, besieged chairman, Prof Lipumba, the Attorney General (AG) and 11 suspended members including deputy secretary general (Mainland) who doubles as Kaliua MP, Ms Magdalena Sakaya.The board appealed with the court to issue a statement that would revoke the registrar s letter that recognises Prof Lipumba as party chairman. It also ask the court to bar the registrar from interfering with party s internal administrative issues .During the interview, Prof Lipumba defended tyhe release of Sh369 million to his faction by office of the parties registrar, saying no article of the Constitution was violated and that the money aimed at enabling his side to engage in political activities.
