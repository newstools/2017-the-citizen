EFF leader Julius Malema has gained some credibility for his supposed prophecy skills in South African politics. Whether it&#8217;s prophecy or information he receives from &#8220;EFF spies&#8221; within the ANC, as some often allege, Malema seems to be call it right almost all the time. National spokesperson of the EFF and MP Mbuyiseni Ndlozi took to Twitter to brag about how whatever the &#8220;CIC&#8221; says comes to light. &#8220;You now know that when the CIC of the EFF speaks, one must take note because it shall surely come to light!&#8221; said Ndlozi. One Twitter user by the name of &#8220;Blesser of my family&#8221;, @PilusaTshidi, responded that &#8220;if [the] CIC can say my wife is cheating, I would divorce her without hesitation! That man never lies!&#8221; Ndlozi was boasting in reference to a story on City Press&#8217; Sunday front page that reported on how Minister of Water and Sanitation Nomvula Mokonyane was allowing a young male companion to run her allegedly bankrupt department. This also follows a tweet the EFF leader posted earlier this month. Malema tweeted that &#8220;Luvo Makasi is running the water affairs in this country, if you want to be paid or tender his the man two speak two otherwise you won&#8217;t succeed.&#8221; Luvo Makasi is running the water affairs in this country, if you want to be paid or tender his the man 2 speak 2 otherwise u won&#39;t succeed pic.twitter.com/L9yrx5qDp7 &mdash; Julius Sello Malema (@Julius_S_Malema) February 6, 2017 The City Press report alleged that &#8220;senior department officials and contractors confirmed how Luvo Makasi, who turns 33 next week, has been attending senior management meetings, &#8216;arrogantly&#8217; dishing out instructions and &#8216;ordering us around'&#8221;. In August last year, the EFF leader predicted that Finance Minster Pravin Gordhan would be arrested, and, a month later in October, the minister was was sent a summons by the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA). Malema said: Zuma appointed Van Rooyen as a minister of finance. He got into trouble. Business put pressure to remove Van Rooyen and put Pravin. And when Zuma put Pravin, Zuma s people came to me and said, We don t want Pravin, and we know you guys don t want Pravin, so please write questions to the president so that the president can answer genuinely and honestly so that we create a cloud around Pravin. And we said, We re not going to be part of that. And I was informed last week that the Guptas came back for their liquidation case and then they told the liquidators not to worry about liquidation because Pravin is going to be arrested and, once Pravin is arrested, then he is going to be removed. Because the argument is going to be that we cannot have a minister who is facing serious charges as a minister of finance, then he will be removed and they will put a minister who will be their choice. And once they put a minister of their choice, the liquidation case against the Guptas will then disappear. Pravin has got shares in all the banks. How can he regulate the banks when he s got shares himself? So he s not our favourite, but we re happy that there is some sense of stability. We have to choose between two devils; one devil is called Pravin, the other devil is called Van Rooyen. Therefore Pravin is a better devil. It now appears inevitable that a move will still be made to remove Gordhan and install a more Gupta-friendly man in the form of Brian Molefe.
