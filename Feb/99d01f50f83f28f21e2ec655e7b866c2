The National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) had approved funding for 309 788 higher education students so far this year and at least another 100 000 are expected to be added to this figure, NSFAS board chairperson Sizwe Nxasana announced on Sunday. The NSFAS had received 161,938 new applications from public university and technical and vocational education and training (TVET) college students; 129,510 of these applications were submitted online, while 32,428 were manual applications, Nxasana told reporters in Pretoria. Of the applications received, the NSFAS had so far approved and sent communication to a total of 105,135 successful new students and also confirmed funding for 204 653 returning students, he said. New entrants to universities receiving funding totalled 79,077 while returning students numbered 110,205 for a total of 186,282. New students at TVET colleges being funded numbered 26,058 and returning students 94,448 for a total of 120,506. With applications for students planning to study at TVET colleges having closed on February 17, the evaluation of the remaining applications would be completed by February 24, which would see a significant increase in TVET college students approved for funding. Given the completion of some 2016 academic year examinations in January 2017 in certain universities, there are also more qualifying students whose results are being evaluated which will also increase the numbers of funded university students. We expect to add more than 100,000 students to the already 309,788 students already funded, Nxasana said. Higher Education and Training Minister Blade Nzimande had confirmed that the NSFAS funding budget for 2017 would be R15 billion. From this budget, we expect to fund well over 405,000 students who were funded in 2016 at both universities and TVET colleges. Out of the total 161,938 applications received, regrettably, we can confirm that there were 53,043 unsuccessful applications from university and TVET college students. Some 3760 applications are still being reviewed. We have also communicated with these unsuccessful applicants and have announced an appeals process available to them. Unsuccessful students can lodge an appeal by downloading an application form on the NSFAS website, filling it in, and emailing it together with their recommendations to this email address: appeals@nsfas.org.za. Appeals should reach NSFAS on or before 28 February 2017, Nxasana said. African News Agency (ANA)
