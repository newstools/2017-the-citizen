South Africa s economy isn t growing fast enough to significantly reduce the country&#8217;s triple challenges of poverty, inequality and unemployment, President Jacob Zuma said on Tuesday. Speaking at a pre-state of the nation address (Sona) luncheon at Grand West Casino with business and labour leaders in Cape Town, Zuma called for the country s transformation policies to be streamlined, saying the majority of black people still remained outside the mainstream economy. Zuma also called on the captains of industry present to work with government to overcome the challenges. We should never rest until the vision for a better life for all is realised [for] all of us as labour, business, community sector and government, he said in his keynote address. The luncheon was overshadowed by the postponement of the signing of a minimum wage agreement spearheaded by Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa that had been planned to take place during the event. In a statement on Tuesday the presidency said the Congress of SA Trade Unions (Cosatu) asked to be given time to provide a full report to its central executive committee regarding a minimum wage of R20 per hour. Business Day reported on Tuesday the National Economic Development and Labour Council on Monday had agreed on the minimum wage. Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan joined Zuma&#8217;s luncheon after his speech at a lunch held at the Mining Indaba in Cape Town. Zuma will deliver his Sona on Thursday night at 7pm.
