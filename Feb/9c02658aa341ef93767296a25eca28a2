Concerned eSikhaleni residents in KwaZulu-Natal believe an evil syndicate is making its rounds at the township s mall and preying on innocent shoppers, Zululand Observer reports. It is believed a group of muthi practicing criminals are robbing shoppers of their belongings. A regular shopper claimed an elderly woman and her accomplices are using black magic to lure people into their car and then rob them. A young man comes and touches a victim from behind and disappears in the crowd. Soon after an old woman comes to the targeted person, telling them that the first guy has rubbed powerful muthi on them and that she can help, said the shopper. She normally tells victims she is a sangoma and can get rid of the bad luck rubbed off by the man. She then lures the shocked victims into the car and takes everything. As Africans, we believe in muthi practices and when someone comes to our rescue, we believe them. According to residents, once the target enters the car, a man appears and threatens the victim with a gun taking all their shopping goods and money.
