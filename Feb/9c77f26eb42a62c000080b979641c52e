Alexander Forbes on Friday announced the resignation of group chief financial officer Deon Viljoen after 14 years in order to pursue other opportunities. The financial services group said Bruce Bydawell will assume the position of acting group chief financial officer after Viljoen s resignation comes into effect from April 30. The company also announced the retirement of Peter Edwards, managing director of institutional financial services, with effect from March 31, though he agreed to stay as a senior adviser post his retirement. Alexander Forbes said extensive searches were under way to identify suitable candidates for both roles and were committed to appointing first-class leaders commensurate with the standing of the group. Andrew Darfoor, the group chief executive, thanked the executives and said the company was making progress in its strategy as a Pan-African financial services leader. The strategy we announced in September 2016 is underpinned by the simplification of our operating model and a focus on delivering an integrated value proposition to our clients through three clear business lines institutional clients, retail clients and emerging markets clients, Darfoor said. This strategy will focus and help us accelerate our execution and delivery capability in building a Pan-African financial services leader. We are making strong and decisive progress with the full backing and support of our Board. In the interim, I will also act as Head of the Institutional clients division effective April 1.
