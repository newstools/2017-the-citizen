Noah won in the categories for Debut Author and Outstanding Literary Work for his book Born A Crime. Things are really looking great for Trevor and we couldn t be more proud. This comes after Noah received the Zora Neale Houston Award for 2017 for his book two weeks ago. About last night- Such an honour to receive 2 NAACP Image Awards for my book Born A Crime . When I wrote the book my only hope was that people would read it. Everything that has happened since is a giant blessing I never dreamed of. Trevor wrote on his Instagram after the ceremony. Although Beyonc didn t attend the ceremony she was the biggest winner on the night. She totally owned the show, claiming honours in the categories for the outstanding female artist, outstanding song for Freedom, and outstanding music video for her visuals for Formation and outstanding album for Lemonade.
