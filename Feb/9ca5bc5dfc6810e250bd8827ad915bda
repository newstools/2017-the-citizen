Thembelani Bholi, the Southern Kings&#8217; bulldozing flanker, has pleaded with local rugby unions to do more to promote the game in rural areas. &#8220;I don&#8217;t we&#8217;re honest if we say enough is being done (to spread the gospel of rugby in rural South Africa),&#8221; he said as the Eastern Cape franchise prepare for their Super Rugby opener against the Jaguares on Saturday. One can trust the 27-year-old&#8217;s judgement in this regard. Also read: Dead men walking? The Kings hold their collective breath Bholi isn&#8217;t one of the skewed cases of transformation in South African sport &#8211; like Kagiso Rabada, Lungi Ngidi or Siya Kolisi, who had privileged and stable schooling backgrounds. Instead, the hard-working stalwart grew up in Maclear in the Eastern Cape and attended Jamangile Senior Secondary School. It&#8217;s a humble, two-structure compound surrounded a two rows of trees. At the back, there&#8217;s a lap of land doubling up as a soccer and rugby pitch. Jamangile doesn&#8217;t even have a telephone line &#8211; it&#8217;s contact number is a Vodacom cellphone. That Bholi, who played Craven Week two years in a row for Border Country Districts, has made it to the top-flight is down to his own determination and one of the rare examples of the imperfect Kings&#8217; true value to transformation. If the Kings wasn&#8217;t established would he have been spotted? It&#8217;s a moot question now. But Bholi believes it shouldn&#8217;t just be down to a &#8220;transformation project&#8221; like the Kings to promote black talent. &#8220;We need the unions to come out to rural areas and expose youngsters to the game,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s important for coaches and players to set aside some time and invest in coaching clinics. Even if it&#8217;s just to try and plant a seed.&#8221; However, Bholi warns opportunity won&#8217;t just fall into a youngster&#8217;s lap. If anything, you have to make your own luck through discipline, something he prides himself on. &#8220;It&#8217;s all about priorities. As a schoolboy, make sure you concentrate on your studies and always deliver your best on the field,&#8221; said Bholi. &#8220;It&#8217;s the best chance to get noticed.&#8221; Bholi hopes some gymwork on his upper body will see him catch the eye in this year&#8217;s campaign. &#8220;When I sustained my knee injury last year, I couldn&#8217;t run so I picked up some weights,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I consider my ability to carry the ball as one of my strengths. I&#8217;m hoping to focus on that this season.&#8221; If Bholi combines that with his tough tackling, he truly could be a star in 2017.
