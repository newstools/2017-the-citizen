Two Rynfield cyclists believe they were deliberately knocked by a motorist as they were heading to Bronkhorstspruit on the morning of February 11, reports the Benoni City Times. Mathew Battson and his brother-in-law, Gordon Smit, are two of three cyclists who were knocked off their bicycles on the R25, allegedly by the same car. When the car knocked us, the mirror of the car came off, said Battson. According to the details of the mirror, the car was a black Toyota Yaris. The Benoni City Times recently reported on the third cyclist, Ken Poole, who was hospitalised after being knocked by a black vehicle. Battson and Smit were cycling on February 11 when the driver of a black vehicle knocked them and drove off, they claimed. A few minutes later, on the same road, the driver of a black vehicle collided with Poole and also drove off. The cyclists were taken to hospital; however, only Poole and Smit were admitted. I was admitted to the Netcare Union Hospital and discharged on Tuesday, Smit said. The specialist said I had a haematoma [a solid swelling of clotted blood within the tissues] on my calf and they had to cut my calf open to release the pressure. Smit will remain on crutches possibly for the next month or more. We were cycling within the yellow lane so we were on the safe side, Smit said. According to Battson, he and Smit cycle early in the morning to avoid annoying motorists on the road during peak time. Battson has been cycling for over a year and Smit has been cycling for three years, but both men have never been involved in an accident with a motorist before. Gordon Smit was admitted to the Netcare Union Hospital and discharged on February 14. Picture: Benoni City Times Caxton News Service For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
