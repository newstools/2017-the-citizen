by Ivan SPECK His side mustered just three wayward efforts on goal in the opening 45 minutes as they allowed Watford to canter into a two-goal lead and damage further their tilt at the Premier League title. &#8220;It was not good in the first half, especially in the first 20 minutes. We were beaten in the duels and Watford were sharper than us,&#8221; Wenger admitted after Tuesday&#8217;s match. &#8220;Did we think subconsciously that we just had to turn up? I don&#8217;t know. Honestly we prepared well for the game. Looking at the preparation, I have no basic regret. &#8220;We knew that Watford would make it very physical and we prepared for that. &#8220;You do not make 47 points after 23 games in the Premier League if you don&#8217;t have physical power, but you have to switch it on 100 percent all of the time in the Premier League. &#8220;We didn&#8217;t start the way we wanted, but in the second half it was all us and let&#8217;s be fair, we didn&#8217;t deserve to lose this game. &#8220;We hit the bar and (Watford goalkeeper Heurelho) Gomes made fantastic saves as well, so I still think that if you look at the chances, we were unlucky to lose. &#8220;On top of that we were a bit unlucky with the free-kick for the first goal and then a deflected shot on top of that.&#8221; Younes Kaboul&#8217;s deflected free-kick gave Watford a 10th-minute lead and Watford added a second three minutes later when Troy Deeney tucked in the rebound from Etienne Capoue&#8217;s shot. Arsenal, who replied through Alex Iwobi, travel to leaders Chelsea on Saturday and Wenger insisted his team will not suffer from a hangover from this result. Nor was he comforted by draws for Chelsea, Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur, which limited the ground Arsenal lost. &#8211; Taylor tribute &#8211; &#8220;We want to respond against Chelsea and win the game, of course. But we first have to analyse why we didn&#8217;t start well in this game,&#8221; said the Frenchman, whose team now trail Chelsea by nine points. &#8220;I&#8217;m responsible for the results of the team so I am very frustrated that we did not win the game. We are playing at home, we had a great opportunity and we had a start like we did. &#8220;We have to learn from that and respond very quickly and in a very convincing way. What the other teams do doesn&#8217;t matter.&#8221; Wenger confirmed that Welsh midfielder Aaron Ramsey had limped off with a calf strain. For Watford manager Walter Mazzari, the result justified his decision to rest almost his entire first team for Sunday&#8217;s FA Cup defeat by third-tier Millwall. The Italian made a point of dedicating the victory to former Watford manager Graham Taylor, who passed away on January 12. &#8220;My objective is for Watford to stay in the Premier League and to make my team grow game by game, week by week,&#8221; said Mazzarri, whose side sit 13th. &#8220;Of course the players need this victory to work better with me and also to believe that they can achieve great things. &#8220;I was very happy at the end because recently we deserved to win some games, but didn&#8217;t because luck was not on our side. We needed a big win, especially for the morale of the team. &#8220;Of course I would have liked us to play the whole 90 minutes like we did in the first half. &#8220;But we had at least four or five players coming back from injury and who hadn&#8217;t played 90 minutes for a long time, so they weren&#8217;t in condition to play the full 90 minutes at the same level. &#8220;Today was a great game and I want to dedicate this victory to a great person in Graham Taylor.&#8221;
