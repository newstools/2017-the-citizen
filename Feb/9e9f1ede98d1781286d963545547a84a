According to information, the two suspects boarded the taxi together with other passengers at Beitbridge,&#8221; police said in a statement. The two occupied the seats directly behind the deceased. The taxi was en route to Polokwane. At one stage along the way the two told the deceased to stop as they wanted to relieve themselves and almost every passenger alighted for the same purpose.&#8221; It is further alleged [that] when [the] taxi approached [the] Fort Edward turn-off the two instructed the driver to take the off-ramp and when he refused one shot him in the head, killing him instantly. The suspects then vanished into the nearby bushes, taking nothing from him.&#8221; Police resources, including a helicopter, were then immediately mobilised to search for the suspects. The search is currently underway and it is believed the suspects might still be in the bush. Arrangements are being made to ferry the stranded passengers to their intended destination, the statement said.
