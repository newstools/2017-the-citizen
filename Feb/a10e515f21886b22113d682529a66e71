AKA has confirmed our suspicions that his so-called breakup with girlfriend Bonang Matheba was a PR stunt. He said the idea originally came when he was watching the Grammys and thought he should release the song on Valentine&#8217;s Day, but then thought to do something unpredictable and anti-Valentine&#8217;s Day. After been given the release date on Tuesday, he figured he had to come up with a strategy to keep his name in the news through the weekend for his song to get the publicity he wanted. Thank You for your LOVE . I see your messages, I feel your spirit &amp; I appreciate your support! You are the fuel this machine runs on. &mdash; AKA (@akaworldwide) February 22, 2017 So, on Friday, he decided to lie to his followers and tell them he had broken up with his girlfriend, news that left his fans heartbroken. &#8220;We planned all the tweets from Friday up until the gift on Monday , and eventually the release,&#8221; he told The Plug. Bonang&#8217;s initial response? &#8220;She loved it. She&#8217;s a visionary, just like me. I told her to trust me, and she did,&#8221; he said. The stunt was a calculated risk, as it could have damaged Bonang&#8217;s Revlon contract, which is based on love. Anyway, he said they enjoyed the tweets that followed. &#8220;It s exciting watching a plan come together.&#8221; Also read: What AKA s new song reveals about DJ Zinhle and Bonang Even Bonang&#8217;s former best friend, Somizi Mhlongo, was not convinced the break up was real.
