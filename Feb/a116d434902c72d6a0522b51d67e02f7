The defeat leaves Madrid just a single point clear of Barcelona and three points ahead of Sevilla and now enjoy just one game in hand over their title rivals. &#8220;We lost this match in the opening ten minutes, ten bad minutes where we let two goals in,&#8221; Eeal coach Zinedine zidane told Spanish TV. &#8220;I&#8217;m not worried, I&#8217;m angry more than anything, because we only have ourselves to blame.&#8221; Italian striker Zaza had broken down in tears after scoring his first goal since May at the weekend, but showed his confidence is suddenly sky high with a brilliant volleyed finish to open the scoring on five minutes. Orellana then finished off a flowing counter-attack on nine, but Cristiano Ronaldo halved Madrid&#8217;s arrears with a towering header from Marcelo&#8217;s cross a minute before half-time. Madrid boss Zidane introduced Gareth Bale off the bench on just his second appearance after a three-month injury layoff for the final half hour. And the Welshman nearly rescued a point when his header from point-blank range was blocked by Enzo Perez a minute from time. Madrid&#8217;s Brazilian wing-back Marcelo agreed with his coach that they had thrown the game away early. &#8220;We&#8217;re still top but we really have to do something to change things, learn from our mistakes,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We got off poorly and it&#8217;s our own fault,&#8221; he said. Madrid will take on Villarreal away on Sunday in their next La Liga game.
