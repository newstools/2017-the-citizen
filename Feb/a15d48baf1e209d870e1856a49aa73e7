Democratic Alliance leader Mmusi Maimane on Friday paid tribute to veteran Congelese opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi, who died on Wednesday. Maimane said the people of the Democratic Republic of Congo and the rest of the continent were left poorer by this giant of African politics who served as the country s opposition leader for decades. Equally so, DRC is in a better position because of Mr Tshisekedi, who was a bellowing voice for accountability and freedom. He will be remembered for his stand against those who practised Big Man Politics, Maimane said in a statement on behalf of the Southern African Partnership for Democratic Change. Mr Tshisekedi, during his long and illustrious political career, stood up for democracy and justice in the face of dictatorship and the erosion of the will of the people. As head of the main opposition Union for Democracy and Social Progess, Tshisekedi was trying to help forge a compromise deal to ease President Joseph Kabila out of power. Thisekedi counted as one of the continent s most tenacious politicians, was a bitter opponent of dictator Mobutu Sese Seko and Kabila s father and predecessor Laurent, both of whom had him jailed. Thisekedi ran and lost against Kabila in the country s last presidential elections, and charged that it was rigged. He died in Brussels.
