The Presidency has issued a statement saying that former public protector Thuli Madonsela has no basis for her allegations that President Jacob Zuma and the State Security Agency may be behind the tensions between herself and Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane. Mkhwebane controversially used to be an analyst at the agency. ALSO READ: Madonsela believes it&#8217;s about revenge for Zuma Madonsela told eNCA on Saturday that the current spat with her successor over deductions to her pension may be a result of interference from the president, the State Security Agency, or both. &#8220;I have no evidence, but I suspect that either President Zuma or people linked to him are behind what&#8217;s happening at the public protector&#8217;s office,&#8221; she said by telephone. &#8220;&#8230; I suspect that the State Security Agency is behind some of the things that happened in my office before [Mkhwebane] was appointed and what has happened since then.&#8221; She said that she wanted to move on with her life, but had been drawn into a legal battle with the new public protector over R470 000 she allegedly owes as costs on her state BMW. She disputes that she owes any money, though the office of the public protector has reiterated their view that she was warned about not using the BMW once her term ended. Madonsela, however, says the car&#8217;s use was arranged through the SA Police Service. Madonsela told eNCA she suspected the deduction from her pension was an act of vengeance for her Nkandla and State of Capture reports. The presidency, in response, said it was &#8220;outraged by utterances by ex-Public Protector Advocate Thuli Madonsela on eNCA that she is being &#8216;targeted&#8217; by President Zuma on reported deductions from her gratuity at her former place of employment, the Office of the Public Protector&#8221;. &#8220;The President does not play any role when it comes to salary and conditions of service of the Public Protector. &#8220;The abuse of Zuma&#8217;s name &#8230; is preposterous and disappointing. The presidency urges Advocate Madonsela to refrain from such conduct.&#8221; &nbsp; PRESIDENCY: is outraged by utterances of former PP Adv #Madonsela on @eNCA that she&#8217;s being &#8220;targeted&#8221; by Pres #Zuma. pic.twitter.com/xoRfUPb2G5 Xoli Mngambi (@XoliMngambi) February 4, 2017 Madonsela had told The Citizen on Thursday that the press conference by her successor had prompted her to break her silence and speak out against the false news and lies about her that legitimise injustice . She explained that: I m breaking my silence because I believe the lies are improper and legitimise injustices. I believe I m being made to #PayBackForZuma and not #PayBackTheMoney as I never took any and never broke any rules regarding how to care for government cars. She reiterated to eNCA, however, that she had no wish to criticise her successor and wanted to maintain a collegial and professional approach to the matter.
