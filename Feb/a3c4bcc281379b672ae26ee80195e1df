In a spectacular show of generosity and opulence , the Cape Wine Auction broke their own record by raising R22.3 million on Saturday at the Antonij Rupert Wine Estate, sponsored by Nedbank Private Wealth. All proceeds raised at the auction, with no deduction, will be allocated to 22 beneficiaries who make a profound impact on education and the lives of children in the Cape Winelands, the Cape Wine Auction said in a statement on Sunday. Bids of exciting travel, luxury accommodation, and limited edition wines went under the hammer with a bespoke experience in Napa Valley, California, reaching a height of R3 million the highest ever paid lot in the history of the auction s existence since 2014. The Lionel and Anton Smit collaborative sculpture, created especially for the auction and standing three-metres tall, reached R1.2 million and included a wine and dining experience at Idiom Fine Dining Restaurant and Wine Estate. Guests from across South Africa and as far as the US, Germany, and Sweden were treated with cuisine prepared by some of South Africa s leading chefs, limited edition wines, and performances by Zolani Mahola, Watershed s Craig Hinds, and George Town. Cape Wine Auction director Darielle Robertson said they were overwhelmed by the generosity of the bidders. &#8220;We set out aiming to raise R15 million this year, but the final amount has literally left everyone speechless. The commitment to giving back, changing lives, and sharing good fortune was certainly testament in the overwhelming bids raised. With this money we can expand our programmes and reach even greater heights with the progress we have achieved so far, she said.
