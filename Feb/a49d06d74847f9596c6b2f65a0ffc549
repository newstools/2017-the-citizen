A trail of blood from a burglary scene resulted in the arrest of a man east of Pretoria on Monday night. Brinant security group spokesperson Martin Barnard said the man and an accomplice had broken into a residence on Edelvalk Street in Monument Park around 22:00pm, Rekord East reported. He said they broke a glass door to gain access into the house. One of the culprits somehow cut his Achilles tendon, said Barnard. He said the family, who were in the house at the time, had locked themselves in the bathroom. The men fled the house with a tablet and a phone. The tablet was later recovered in the veld not far from the home. Barnard said officers responded to a community group Whatsapp message. He said a resident had typed help and the address. The response found blood in the house and followed the trail to a man lying in the veld not far from the scene, he said. Barnard lauded the officers, who responded though the homeowner was not a client. He said the man was handed over to the Lyttelton police. Police spokesperson Captain Dave Miller confirmed the arrest and said a house breaking docket was opened at the station. The suspect was taken to hospital for medical attention and is under heavy police guard, said Miller, adding the man would appear in the Pretoria Magistrates Court as soon as he was fit to. &#8211; Caxton News Service
