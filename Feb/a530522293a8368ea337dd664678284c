Parliament s Joint Committee on Ethics and Members Interests, adopted the 2016 register of parliamentarians interest on Thursday but could not release it publicly due to a confidentiality breach. The document, which lists the financial interests of the National Assembly and the National Council of Provinces MPs and the gifts they received, will likely only be released publicly next week. Chairperson of the committee Nkosiyakhe Amos Masondo said: We will arrange that we organise the proper and detailed press briefing not later than Tuesday next week. There is a part of the register that is not supposed to be made public. Co-chairperson of the committee Aumsen Singh added: There s a confidential section. Each member has certain information that is not public information. In the form, there s a confidential section. They would want to keep it personal.
