A swift and effective response by Bloemfontein police K9 members with the assistance of the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (Hawks) has resulted in the arrest of two alleged drug dealers found in possession of Mandrax tablets with a street value of more than R100,000, Free State police said on Sunday. The officers acted on a tip-off to be on the lookout of a white VW polo sedan with two occupants suspected to be transporting drugs on the N1 en-route from Johannesburg to Bloemfontein, Captain Chaka Marope said. According to snippets of information the drugs were destined for local dealers in Bloemfontein. Intensive patrols were initiated on the N1 towards Bloemfontein and early on Friday morning officers spotted a car fitting the description and pulled it off the road about 30km from Bloemfontein. Upon an immediate search of the car officers found 10 plastic bags containing 2000 Mandrax tablets hidden in the airbag compartment on the car s dashboard and in the left rear door. The drugs were estimated to have a street value of about R110,000. Both the vehicle and the drugs were confiscated and the driver and passenger, aged 33 and 35, were arrested. They were expected to appear in the Bloemfontein Magistrate`s Court on Monday on charges of possession of drugs, Marope said.
