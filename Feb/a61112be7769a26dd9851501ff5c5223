A 27-year-old woman was arrested after allegedly stabbing her two-year-old son in the neck in De Doorns the South African Police Service (SAPS) said on Monday. She is expected to make a court appearance in Khayelitsha, on Tuesday, on a charge of attempted murder, spokesperson Captain FC Van Wyk said. The arrest was made after an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the attempted murder case. The incident occurred at their residence in Makhaza on Sunday, February 5, before the suspect fled. Crime against women and children are high on the priority list of the Western Cape police, and we will not tolerate such acts of violence to be perpetrated against children in their own homes, said Van Wyk.
