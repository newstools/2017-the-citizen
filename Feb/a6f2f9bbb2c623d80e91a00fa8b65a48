Following B3nchmarq, A Reece and Fifi Cooper&#8217;s departure from record label Ambitiouz on Friday, Twitter has been dragging rapper Emtee, accusing him of betraying his fellow artists for not following suit. Even B3nchmarq tweeted Emtee, expressing his disappointment at him for putting &#8220;your soul on auction like this&#8221;. I&#39;m So Disappointed In You @EmteeSA &#8230; YOU KNOW Wassup dawg. Don&#39;t Put Up Your Soul On Auction Like This. YOU KNEW this Time Was Coming &mdash; Jay Jody Lepara (@PJayB3nchMarQ) February 19, 2017 Emtee has, however, hit back at his critics, saying his father taught him to finish whatever he started, and laying down a marker that he was not going anywhere. &#8220;My parents are proud of me. Avery [his daughter] will know how to swim in a few days, @african_trap [his record label] is a functioning company. They mad,&#8221; he responded to his critics. In fact, Emtee says the record label will continue to be successful as long as he&#8217;s still part of it. The record label has been accused of buying Emtee a house and car to make him stay on board and thus make other artists seem &#8220;ungrateful&#8221;. My parents are proud of me. Avery will know how to swim in a few days, @african_trap is a functioning company. Dey mad &mdash; BOB MARLEY (@EmteeSA) February 19, 2017 However, the Roll Up hit maker has dismissed the claims, saying he bought not only himself, but his family and friends, a house. &#8220;Nobody will bother us again,&#8221; he said. On Friday afternoon, A Reece took to Twitter to share with his fans that he was leaving Ambitiouz, without divulging more information on the reasons he was leaving. To whom this may concern the most: The fans. I would like to say that I m no longer a part of @AmbitiouzEnt as of now moving forward, he wrote. Also read: Shocker! Top rappers Fifi Cooper, B3nchmarq and A Reece Leave Ambitiouz Fifi Cooper also took to Instagram to tell her fans she was leaving the stable.

Since then, in a series of tweets, the label has criticised B3nchmarq, saying he had been a &#8220;financial loss&#8221; after many failed attempts to push his music. It further said it would release a statement regarding Fifi Cooper and A Reece. The matter might be taken to the courts, it said.
