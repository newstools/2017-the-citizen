The Blitzboks&#8217; all-time try-scoring record holder, Seabelo Senatla, said the back-to-back tournament wins for the side was the perfect way for himself and forward Kwagga Smith to end their current involvement. Senatla and Smith will now join up with the Stormers and Lions respectively for the upcoming Super Rugby campaign. &#8220;I&#8217;m not gone forever, so would say it was a great way to press pause in my sevens career,&#8221; said the winger, who has scored 189 career tries since becoming a Blitzbok in 2013.

He scored 17 tries in these two tournaments. &#8220;I&#8217;m at a good place at the moment and very fortunate. Moving to fifteens is a nice challenge though and something I am looking forward to,&#8221; Senatla said. Smith said the team played to their strengths in beating USA, Australia and England on Sunday to win the title. &#8220;There&#8217;s a great winning culture here. We&#8217;re are a band of brothers. We went out there and played the way we wanted to play. It is sad to go, but it will always be sad to leave this team and there will never be a right time.&#8221; Springbok Sevens captain, Philip Snyman, was also full of praise for the two departing players. &#8220;We know they will do well in Super Rugby, they will be back one day and then they will just slot back in. We wish them well,&#8221; he said. Snyman was pretty pleased with the two wins. &#8220;We have played great rugby over two weekends and achieved everything we wanted to. We can&#8217;t ask for more. In the final we played like we planned. Our defensive system was great and that paved the way. We have something pretty special going, but only hard work will keep us there.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
