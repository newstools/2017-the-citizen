A Queensburg resident in KwaZulu-Natal, Wynand Pretorius, is offering a R10 000 reward for any information that could lead to the recovery of his trailer that was stolen on Sydney Road, Durban, Highway Mail reports. Pretorius, who works at Advance Cleaning Services as a hygiene manager, said the trailer contained three hawk high-pressure washer machines that he uses daily for his work. A devastated Pretorius said he stopped at the BB Premier Bakery on Sydney Road at 6am on Tuesday, February 14, to collect some items to take to the bakery BB in Pinetown. When I came out at about 6.10am, the trailer with the machines were gone, he said. Pretorius said they looked at the CCTV BB bakery camera footage and saw a man driving a white Toyota Hilux with a canopy stopping next to my car.

He said in other CPF surveillance camera footage, the car is seen going up Sydney Road, then turning right into Rick Turner Road and crossing over to Mayville, towards Pinetown. After that we could not trace it anymore as there are no cameras that side, he said. He pleaded with anyone who can assist to get the machines back to contact him. This is my life, I need these machines for work, he said. Anyone who has information can contact Pretorius on 061 275 9803. A case of theft has been opened at the Umbilo police.
