The youngest MP in South Africa&#8217;s history, Hlomela Bucwa, gave her maiden speech in parliament this week and, despite her clearly being nervous, she has been given great acclaim for her eloquence. &#8220;Madam chair, I am moved to share the words of [William Butler Yeats]: &#8216;But I, being poor, have only my dreams. I have spread my dreams under your feet. Tread softly, because you tread on my dreams.'&#8221; She was quoting the poem The Cloths of Heaven. She charged that the young generation in South Africa&#8217;s &#8220;dreams have been denied, hope has been diminished, trust has been broken, whose talents have been crippled&#8221;. She said this &#8220;lost generation&#8221; was the victim of two decades of government corruption and greed &#8230; &#8220;whose government has turned its back on its people&#8221;. She alleged the young people who&#8217;d given their lives at Sharpeville would &#8220;cringe in their graves&#8221; to look at today&#8217;s government, &#8220;which is no longer a selfless government&#8221;. She alleged that government was now &#8220;scared of its young people &#8230; that is why they bring us 40-year-olds instead of people my age&#8221;. &#8220;We find ourselves with a suppressive government that has failed its young people, that refuses to be corrected.&#8221; She bemoaned the state of the basic education system, &#8220;which [teaches] to look for jobs, not to create jobs&#8221;. She said there were 3 million people of her age (around 25) who were a lost generation, &#8220;mainly black, who are not in education, employment or training. They have been left behind.&#8221; She said it would up to her generation to change the status quo, and not be divided by race, gender or religion &#8230; this generation will become the beacon of hope because you, as adults, have failed to provide that for us.&#8221; She said the DA would rescue her generation and the country, and then provided a list of policy plans from the party to transform and improve education. The speech will probably be remembered most, though, for her poetic closing line: &#8220;Let us tread softly because we tread on the dreams of a lost generation. @HlomelaBucwa What a moving inuagural speech.
