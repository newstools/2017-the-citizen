Police in Seshego, Polokwane, are investigating a murder, attempted murder, and an inquest following an incident on Saturday night and Sunday morning, Limpopo police said. It is alleged that a 41-year-old man went to his girlfriend s parental home at about [9.30pm] and on arrival he broke the door of the house, entered, and started stabbing the girlfriend, killing her instantly, and further stabbed the girlfriend s mother and left the scene, Lt-Col Moatshe Ngoepe said. Responding to the incident, the police found the 30-year-old girlfriend with multiple stab wounds lying in a pool of blood in the bedroom. Her mother was seriously wounded and was taken to hospital for medical treatment. [A] police manhunt for the suspect ensued until in the early hours of today [Sunday] when he was found hanging and dead at a distance away from where he killed his girlfriend. Cases of murder, attempted murder, and inquest were opened and the motive behind this senseless killing is unknown but domestic violence cannot be ruled out. Police investigations are still continuing. The SAPS [South African Police Service] would like to condemn this type of incident in the most strongest words and that people must refrain from resorting to violence when dealing with domestic-related problems, but must seek assistance from the relevant authorities, including the social workers and psychologists, Ngoepe said.
