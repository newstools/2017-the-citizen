Dar es Salaam. After battling to a barren draw with Africa Champions League title holders Mamelodi Sundowns of South Africa recently, Azam FC are now fine-tuning for yet another high-profile friendly match.Azam, the country s flag bearers in CAF Confederation Cup, will go head to head with Zambia s Red Arrows at the Chamazi Complex in the city later this week in what promises to be an exciting match.For the former Cecafa Kagame Cup Champions, the match will be part of their preparations ahead of their CAF Confederation Cup assignment next month, according to the club officials.Azam, also the reigning Mapinduzi Cup champions, will launch their campaign in the continental tournament by taking on the winner of a preliminary round match between Botswana s Orapa United and Mbabane Swallows of Swaziland. Despite dropping two vital points in their scoreless draw with Ruvu Shooting in a Vodacom Premier League match at the Chamazi venue on Saturday, the ice cream makers new coach, Romanian Aristica Cioaba, still believe they can win the league.And officials of the Chamazi outfit say they are more content with the way the ice cream makers are playing now than two or so months ago, when a poor performance prompted the club leadership to declare they were out of the Premier League title race. The former Mainland Champions sit third in the league standing with 38 points, 11 adrift second-placed Young Africans and 13 behind leaders Simba SC.The Msimbazi Reds bounced back to the summit of the league with a deserved 3-0 win over Tanzania Prisons at the National Stadium on Saturday.Red Arrows, whose one of their former coaches, George Lwandamina, is now at the helm of Yanga s technical bench, are shaping up for the Zambian league, which resumes later this month.They arrived in the country over the weekend at the invitation of Azam, who have vowed to mark a mark in this year s CAF Confederation Cup.And if results of their recent matches are anything to go by, they seem to have what it takes to perform well in the continental tournament.They stunned both Yanga and Simba in the Mapinduzi Cup in Zanzibar last month before beating the latter 1-0 in a Premier League match at the National Stadium recently.
