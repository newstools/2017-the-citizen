Country Girl hit maker Bulelwa &#8216;Zahara&#8217; Mkutukana has become a trending topic on Twitter after posting a picture in a revealing outfit. Zahara, posted the picture and said she was getting ready for a photo shoot, but we don&#8217;t think she was ready for the comments she would receive. The award-winning musician was criticised for basically everything. While some criticised her for being a &#8220;weave girl&#8221; instead of rocking her natural hair like she used to, some said they had lost respect for her for wearing a revealing dress. getting ready for the shoot A post shared by Bulelwa Mkutukana (@zaharasa) on Feb 16, 2017 at 5:58am PST These were some of the comments she received: &#8220;Respect yourself girl I use to love your songs and you but now you make me to hate you.&#8221; &#8220;It&#8217;s not working for me you make me feel uneasy by just looking at you.
