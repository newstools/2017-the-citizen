Reinardt Janse van Rensburg charged to victory on Sunday, earning the national road race title for the first time in his career at the SA Road Cycling Championships in Wellington. The former SA time trial champion, who was third in the solo contest earlier in the week, crossed the line just ahead of Dimension Data teammate Stefan de Bod, who successfully defended his national Under-23 crown. &#8220;This is the first time I have won the nationals road race in any category so it is a very special moment for me,&#8221; Janse van Rensburg said. &#8220;The team was fantastic today. They really did a super job.&#8221; Willie Smit (Roadcover), who was dropped in a late break, finished third overall to take the silver medal in the elite division.
