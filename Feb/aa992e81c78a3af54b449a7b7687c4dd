Netshiundaon added: Two Nigerians aged 20 and 30 were arrested at a nearby town for being in possession of two laptops which belonged to the victims. While continuing with the investigations, the officers spotted a vehicle that belonged to one of the deceased. Two men were spotted getting into the vehicle. Police then moved to make an arrest, and a shootout ensued, said the Hawks spokesperson.
