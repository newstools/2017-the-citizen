As some people prepare to exchange presents with loved ones on Valentine&#8217;s Day, others have taken a different stand ahead of the special day. As the hashtag #ThingsIWouldntDoForLove trended, users shared a few things they would never, ever do for love. From paying for their own lobola, to giving out their bank pin, here are some hilarious tweets on what people definitely would not do for love. One user had a hilarious take, saying he&#8217;d never send his woman alone to the ATM in the name of love.
