The Democratic Alliance intends to submit a formal complaint to the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) over the black-ops campaign, allegedly run by the ANC and used to discredit opposition parties during the 2016 municipal elections. DA leader Mmusi Maimane said the party on Tuesday met the IEC at its headquarters where a fruitful, frank and robust meeting was conducted. Regarding the matter of the ANC s false propaganda campaign, which aimed to illegally and fraudulently influence the election outcome, the commission invited the Democratic Alliance to submit a formal complaint in order to activate an official investigation by the IEC, Maimane said. We have decided to do so, and will submit the formal complaint in the coming days. He also raised the process being engaged following the ANC s intimidation of deputy chairperson Terry Tselane .

In this regard, I requested that a report on the intimidation be tabled before parliament, as this is the body that this important Chapter 9 institution ultimately accounts to. Maimane said he further stressed to the commission that it must at all times maintain its strict independence and fulfil its constitutional obligations . The IEC says it would be premature to comment . Should circumstances require the commission to take any further action it will not hesitate to discharge its duties and obligations, the IEC said. Political analyst Daniel Silke said as South Africa approaches the 2019 national elections, more of these political shenanigans can be expected.
