Impala Platinum s (Implats) headline earnings per share (HEPS) is expected to suffer a loss of between 65 and 79 cents for the half year ended December 31, 2016, the platinum miner warned on Monday. This would be a significant decline in earnings compared to 53 cents per share profit for the half year ended December 31, 2015. Implats said the major reason for the decline in HEPS from the comparative period was that the prior period included a tax credit due to a write-off of an amount owed by a debtor. HEPS from continuing operations for the current year was also expected to be negatively affected by 10 to 15 cents a share when the group s share of profit after tax from Impala Chrome is eliminated as discontinued operations profit due to the group s stake in this entity being up for sale. Impala s reviewed interim financial results for the period ended 31 December 2016 would be released next week. African News Agency For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
