The North West province will introduce the OR Tambo Top Maths and Science achievers for all grade 12 learners in all the villages, township and small dorpies, premier Supra Mahumapelo said on Friday. He said this was to fulfil African National Congress (ANC) president Oliver Tambo s wish to see the African child master science and maths subjects. This OR Tambo initiative will launch the first cohort of learners who will be products of what we call consistent push, a year-long dedicated strategy aimed at identifying and giving support throughout the year to all learners from grade 9 to 12, with the possibility of placing struggling day learners into boarding schools in consultation with their families for intensive support, he said delivering the state of the province address in Taung. As part of this initiative, NGO s, retired professionals, university lecturers and other professionals will be recruited to provide extra classes over weekends, evening, holidays and with cooperation of SGB s during dedicated school hour periods. Mahumapelo said for the first time in 2017, the province would announce all pass rates in all public schools from grade 1 to 12. -African News Agency For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
