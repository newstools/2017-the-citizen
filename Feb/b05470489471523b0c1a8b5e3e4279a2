Political journalist Carien du Plessis started a debate she was never ready for on Twitter after complaining about President Jacob Zuma&#8217;s mispronunciation of fallen Bok Joost van der Westhuizen&#8217;s name in parliament on Thursday night. During his Sona, the president expressed his condolences at the death of the Bok legend, and he paused briefly before wading in bravely to pronounce the name. It did not go terribly well and sounded something like: &#8220;Djhooost &#8230; Fun Die &#8230; Wooesthooozeen.&#8221; Du Plessis was not impressed with the president&#8217;s &#8220;murder&#8221; of the name. Taking to Twitter, she said: &#8220;Zuma murders Joost van der Westhuizen&#8217;s name by pronunciation expressing condolences. Someone fire the presidential speech writers #SONA2017,&#8221; after which she received a backlash she had probably not anticipated. Zuma murders Joost van der Westhuizen&#39;s name by pronunciation expressing condolences. Someone fire the presidential speech writers #SONA2017 &mdash; carien du plessis (@carienduplessis) February 9, 2017 The first comment on her tweet challenged her to correctly pronounce a Zulu name, Nhlakanipho, and later suggested she would probably pronounce it &#8220;Nshlaka Nshhalakanipo&#8221; anyway. These were some of the comments she received: &#8220;He&#8217;s not getting marks for language and pronunciation in parliament &#8211; that&#8217;s the least of SA worries here.&#8221; &#8220;Pronouncing Mr v.d. Westhuizen&#8217;s surname is not the exam any official has to pass to be deemed worthy.&#8221; &#8220;Are you for real Karien? I&#8217;m not Zuma&#8217;s fan but wena can you pronounce Gedleyehlekisa? Sit down with your white privilege. NXAA!&#8221; &#8220;Current do places must sit down.&#8221; &#8220;Eish when it comes to pronunciation of African names it&#8217;s hurting issue next To The Land Question. So thread [sic] carefully.&#8221; &#8220;Jy kan nie ernstig wees nie!! Hoe is jou isiZulu uitspraak? Daar&#8217;s wragtig genoeg ander banaliteit om oor te kla! [You can t be serious!! How is your Zulu pronunciation? There s literally enough other banality to complain about!]&#8221; Another one called her a &#8220;hypocrite&#8221; for not complaining after DA chief whip John Steenhuisen recently &#8220;murdered&#8221; Esidimeni, which he falteringly pronounced &#8220;Esimeni&#8221;. Those who supported her said it was important for him as a political figure to get the name right, saying it was the speech writers&#8217; job to teach the president how to pronounce names right. It&#8217;s not the first time she&#8217;s been in hot water on social media. She had to apologise some time ago for talking about &#8220;pantypreneurs&#8221; at an ANC event, something that did not sit well with particularly the ANC Women&#8217;s League and elicited an official reaction from ANC spokesperson Zizi Kodwa. She was banned from attending the party&#8217;s 104th anniversary celebration in Rustenburg in January 2016 following her tweet referring to people attending the event as &#8220;pantypreneurs and tenderpreneurs&#8221;.
