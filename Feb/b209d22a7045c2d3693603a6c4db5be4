Minenhle &#8216;Minnie&#8217; Dlamini is the first woman ever to be on the cover of KickOff Magazine, and Twitter is really not impressed. Minnie is trending, with most saying she was not supposed to be the first woman to be on the cover of the soccer magazine when there are many sportswomen who could have done the job. Sports presenter Carol Tshabalala and former Banyana Banyana player Portia Modise, Desiree Ellis, Noko Matlou, Amanda Dlamini, to name a few, were overlooked, Twitter has argued. &#8220;The saddest thing about this Minnie cover on KickOff is that Portia Modise was a Banyana Banyana star for close to a decade. No cover,&#8221; one said. Some have, however, defended Minnie, saying it was the magazine that was the problem for using a model and someone who knew &#8220;nothing&#8221; about sports to up their sales. The first woman on the cover of @KickOffMagazine, @MinnieDlamini. She&#39;s got one heck of a story to tell, too. March issue out tomorrow. pic.twitter.com/pxUAfmxoMz &mdash; Sibusiso Mjikeliso (@Sbu_Fundraiser) February 23, 2017 What are your thoughts on Minnie being the first woman to grace the cover of KickOff Magazine? These were some of the comments on Twitter: Wow guys :/ Desiree Ellis, Portia Modise, Noko Matlou, Amanda Dlamini all exist and Minnie is the first woman on your cover? Yhu! https://t.co/z4FnWkUoks &mdash; #Shoes2School (@Mtha_Veekay) February 23, 2017 LRT also&#8230;if it&#39;s just the presenter route they choosing to use,why hasnt Carol Ma ana graced the cover before Minnie.anyway &mdash; Gugulethu (@Pridendlovu) February 23, 2017 So many women,retired or still playing or TV pundits who deserved 2 b on the KickOff cover nt Minnie,it doesn&#39;t make sense @Sbu_Fundraiser &mdash; Itumeleng Seleke (@Selektah12) February 23, 2017 I get that Kick Off Magazine has been slacking in terms of puttingfemale soccer players on. Why bring it up when it&#39;s Minnie on the cover? &mdash; Lord Voldemort (@Ntshalie) February 23, 2017 Kickoff magazine wanted to create a buzz and revive their brand. That magazine is so irrelevant now. They knew Minnie would cause havoc. &mdash; Lesego (@LesegoPase) February 23, 2017 The saddest thing about this Minnie cover on Kick Off is that Portia Modise was a Banyana Banyana star for close to a decade. No cover &mdash; Sicelo (@SiceloDumakude) February 23, 2017 Kick Off&#39;s readership is men &amp; they dgaf about women&#39;s soccer or its iconic figures. They do care about Minnie&#39;s figure. That&#39;s the answer. &mdash; Gryffinwhore (@Neo_url) February 23, 2017 Minnie knows zero about soccer even, wuwow!!! Popularity vs talent in SA will forever be a problem. &mdash; Zamangwanya (@Zamangwanya) February 23, 2017 Look I&#39;m happy for Minnie Dlamini. Here success adds to women success. We need as many as we can gather in this lifetime. &mdash; Jersey no.10 (@Nomie_fied) February 23, 2017 @Em_el_ou I&#39;m pretty sure there a lot of women that it would&#39;ve made sense to put on the cover and Minnie, I do love her, is not one of them &mdash; uthingo lwenkosazana (@nobantubaker) February 23, 2017 Yes I do. You missed my point. It was ridiculing the choice to put Minnie on the cover @apsa_songongo @kgauzi @Sbu_Fundraiser &mdash; Zuko Tshigabe (@Zukolate) February 23, 2017 @Sbu_Fundraiser @KickOffMagazine when your social currency weighs more than experience &amp; level of expertise in the sporting field &mdash; anathi (@anathiamantlane) February 23, 2017 @Zukolate @kgauzi @Sbu_Fundraise You do realize that Carol Tshabalala would&#39;ve brought in more sales as she&#39;s GLOBALLY recognized than mini? &mdash; Phekeza (@apsa_songongo) February 23, 2017 @Sbu_Fundraiser @MinnieDlamini So many experienced female soccer presenters, commentators and PLAYERS that deserved this more &mdash; Mnelisi Phungula (@Mnelisi) February 23, 2017
