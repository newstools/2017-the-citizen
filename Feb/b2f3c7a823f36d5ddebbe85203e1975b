Dar es Salaam. Mainland giants Young Africans launched their Africa Champions League campaign with a bang as they crushed hosts Ngaya de Mbe 5-1 in the preliminary round, first leg tie in Moroni, Comoros yesterday.This means Ngaya de Mbe need a victory of at least five clear goals in the return leg clash at the National Stadium two weeks later to sail through.Should Yanga eliminate the Comoros team, they will take on the winner of another preliminary round match between Rwanda s APR and Zanaco of Zambia in the first round match.The Jangwani Street boys took command of the match right from the start, but had to wait until two minutes to half time to break the stalemate through their Zambian midfielder Justin Zulu.It was his first goal since joining the Mainland champions a few months ago.Celebrations that greeted the goal had hardly died down when slippery winger Simon Msuva, who was a thorn in the flesh for the hosts defenders, doubled the lead for a 2-0 half time lead.On resumption, George Lwandamina s men pressed upfront relentlessly for more goals. It was just a matter of time before they made it 3-0.In the 59th minute, their efforts paid off when Zambian striker Obrey Chirwa netted the third goal for the visitors before Burundian Amisi Tambwe made it 4-0 in the 65th minute.Still fighting, the hosts pulled one back in the 66th minute when second half substitute Said Bourah Mohammed unleashed a shot that went straight into the net.Yanga, needing a convincing win to take a giant step towards the next stage of the continental tournament, scored the fifth goal in the 73rd minute through their Zimbabwean forward Thabani Kamusoko.Yanga, who started the match as favourites, could have won the showdown even by a bigger margin had it not been poor finishing.Ngaya, who were not impressive in yesterday s game, took the game to Yanga towards the end of the match but had trouble in breaking down the visitors defence.Line-ups:Yanga: Deogratius Munishi, Juma Abdul, Mwinyi Hajji, Nadir Haroub, Kelvin Yondani, Justin Zullu, Simon Msuva/Emmanuel Martin, Thabani Kamusoko, Amissi Tambwe/Juma Mahadhi, Obrey Chirwa and Haruna Niyonzima/Said Juma.Ngaya: Said Mmadi, Said Hachim, Said Tothir, Adhepeau Denis Hubert, Ali Ahmada, Youssouf Ibrahim Moidjie, Zamir Mohammed, Mounir Moussa, Franck Said Abderemane, Rakoarimanana Falinurina and Chadhuili Mradabi.
