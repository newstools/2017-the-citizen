As many as 21 people were injured on Friday morning after the minibus taxi they were travelling in overturned on the N3 Highway, 10 km from the Bergville Plaza in Ladysmith, KwaZulu Natal. ER24 Spokesperson Russel Meiring said at about 06h55, ER24 paramedics responded to a call and found the midibus on its side on the side of the road. The passengers had already disembarked. Meiring said paramedics assessed the patients and found that 21 people had sustained injuries ranging from minor to moderate. Paramedics treated the patients and transported 16 to Escourt Hospital for further treatment. Five other patients were removed privately, to a nearby hospital. The patients later told paramedics that a tyre burst caused the driver to lose control of the vehicle. Local authorities were on the scene to investigate further, Meiring said.
