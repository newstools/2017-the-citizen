The Minister of Labour, Mildred Oliphant, will launch a R17 million skills programme for the Compensation Fund in partnership with the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants on Friday. This is an entity that compensates and rehabilitates those that get injured and sometimes pass away due to occupational hazards. The fund is currently undergoing a major overhaul and realignment to meet its social security obligation in the South African labour market, said Sithembele Tshwete, Labour spokesperson. Tshwete said the skills programme was aimed at injecting financial, accounting and actuarial skills into the Compensation Fund. The skills transfer programme will take between three and six years to complete. Workplace hazards, deaths and injuries often need such special and scarce skills like Orthotics, Medical Doctors, Occupational Therapists and Prosthetics in order to treat and rehabilitate those that are severely injured, said Tshwete. In addition to this the fund does need financial, accounting and actuarial skills in order to run prudently and efficiently in the area of social security.
