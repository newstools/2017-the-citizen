The 16th Metro FM Awards are happening at the iNkosi Albert Luthuli International Convention in Durban and, as usual, celebrities showed us their best outfits. Twitter has been commenting on the best and worst outfits, and, so far, Kelly Khumalo, Ntando Duma and Lerato Kganyago have set tongues wagging, for different reasons. According to Twitter, Ntando Duma is the best dressed so far in her gown that leaves the right amount of cleavage. Check out her dress below: Ok, Ntando Duma SLAYED the #MMA16 carpet with this dress LOVE IT pic.twitter.com/1tEjRfinZk &mdash; Karabo Mokgoko (@Karabo_Mokgoko) February 25, 2017 It s a NO for Lerato Kganyago, who decided to play it safe with a velvet suit. Kganyago told Phat Joe that she s the queen of suits and always wears the best but decided to be safe tonight. There was nothing underneath the suit, she told Phat Joe. Twitter might not be impressed with her outfit but at least everything she is wearing tonight is from a local designer. Local is lekker, but the outfit, eish! Maybe she should just leave the suits alone and do something different. The hair looks good though. This is what she&#8217;s wearing tonight: Lerato Kganyago metro awards outfits. #MMA16 pic.twitter.com/dGWbgC3jce &mdash; Kedibone (@Kedi_1love) February 25, 2017 Kelly Khumalo s dress is not impressive either. She also left Twitter wondering if there was underwear underneath that dress. Well, it s not that difficult to check if there is underwear as the dress shows most of her body. Is there something missing here?
