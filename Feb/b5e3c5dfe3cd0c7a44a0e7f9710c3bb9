Among those joining this quartet in Friday&#8217;s draw at UEFA&#8217;s headquarters in Nyon were Roma, Besiktas and Borussia Moenchengladbach. Tottenham failed to match Manchester United&#8217;s progress 24 hours earlier when slumping to a shock Europa League exit as Gent&#8217;s 2-2 draw at Wembley gave the unfancied Belgians a stunning 3-2 aggregate success in the last 32 second leg. Mauricio Pochettino&#8217;s side trailed 1-0 from the first leg and they were unable to overturn the deficit despite twice leading on the night. Christen Eriksen put Tottenham ahead before Gent levelled through Harry Kane&#8217;s own goal on the stroke of half-time. Tottenham midfielder Dele Alli was sent off for a horror challenge after the interval and although Victor Wanyama restored the hosts&#8217; advantage, Jeremy Perbet&#8217;s late strike was enough to seal Gent&#8217;s upset in front of a new Europa League record attendance of 80,465. Earlier, a last-minute header from Isaac Kiese Thelin squeezed Anderlecht through on away goals. Anderlecht&#8217;s hopes of progressing against Zenit St Petersburg appeared over after the Russians overturned a 2-0 first leg deficit to lead 3-2 with seconds remaining. But Isaac Kiese Thelin&#8217;s decisive intervention earned Anderlecht an unlikely ticket to the last 16 to keep alive their dream of a first continental honour since their 1983 UEFA Cup triumph. It was the 24-year-old Swedish international&#8217;s first goal for the club he joined last month on loan from French Ligue 1 outfit Bordeaux. Ajax had lifted the UEFA Cup the season before Anderlecht and the Dutch giants made it into the next round courtesy of defender Nick Viergever&#8217;s close-range finish in the 49th minute against Legia Warsaw. The only goal over the two legs put Ajax through by the slimmest of margins. Also progressing were Roma, 4-1 on aggregate despite Villarreal taking the second leg 1-0, Besiktas, APOEL and Olympiakos. Lyon powered through with a crushing 7-1 defeat of AZ Akmaar for an 11-2 aggregate success with Nabil Fekir securing a hat-trick. On Wednesday Manchester United cruised into the last 16 with a 1-0 win at Saint Etienne for a 4-0 aggregate success. Also surviving to live another day in Europe&#8217;s second tier competition on Wednesday were Schalke and Russian outfit Krasnodar, who saw off Fenerbahce.
