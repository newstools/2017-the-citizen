Comedian Casper de Vries is set to take Carnival City by storm this month. And fans must brace for stomach-wrenching laughter at the Mardi Gras Theatre when this seasoned funnyman returns on February 17 and 18. We are thrilled to host one of biggest names in Afrikaans, and now also English, comedy, Carnival City marketing manager Michelle Smith said. It is true that dynamite comes in small packages. De Vries had announced his retirement from one-man stand-up comedy in an interview with Channel 24 in 2013, but has since made a strong comeback. More theatrical and intimate than before, is how de Vries has described his latest routine, Alive en Vrolik. This time, I ll be performing in my living room, de Vries said when describing the comfort he felt on stage. This unapologetic comedian, actor, entertainer, painter, composer, director and producer is known for his absurdity during performances. Although he initially catered only for the Afrikaans market, De Vries has recently incorporated English into his act. And this move prompted by his recent work on TV station Comedy Central Africa and internet radio Cliff Central was a stroke of genius, as it added an abundance of English followers to his already vast Afrikaans base. And along with the good vibes came his recent Savanna Comics Choice Lifetime Achievement Award. But for the wet-behind-the-ears comedy newbie, be warned. De Vries s shows are not for the easily offended. The use of unabashed language and bold views on topics like humanity, religion and politics make this a show for those who can take it .
