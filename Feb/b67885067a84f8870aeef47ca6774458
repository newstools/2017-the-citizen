It says much about the poor state of Springbok rugby that 2016 actually put back new members of the side&#8217;s development instead of enriching them. Lionel Mapoe is one of those players. How could arguably the best centre in last year&#8217;s Super Rugby campaign look so brilliant at the Lions and yet so mediocre in the Green-and-Gold? Also read: Trend-setting Lions lag behind in transformation It&#8217;s a question that will give critics further ammunition that Allister Coetzee and his assistants aren&#8217;t suitable to coach the Boks. But Mapoe, who played 10 Tests last year, can&#8217;t afford to hold a grudge. &#8220;I can&#8217;t dwell on the past. It won&#8217;t help me,&#8221; he says. &#8220;What I need to do now is be the player I was for the Lions last year. And quickly.&#8221; The 28-year-old stalwart, who&#8217;s also more than comfortable on the wing, actually tries to take the emotion out of review the Springboks&#8217; horror campaign under Coetzee. &#8220;It sounds silly but I feel everyone realised again you&#8217;ve constantly got to work hard at international level. That applies to a player and a coach,&#8221; says Mapoe. &#8220;I do wonder though if people weren&#8217;t too rough on us. I don&#8217;t think they realise how different the playing styles in South Africa are. &#8220;Most of the squad was a new one. They had certain ways of playing in their heads. To get different players to play one style takes time. We realised it but others didn&#8217;t. Maybe we&#8217;ve taken too long to gel but I&#8217;m confident we&#8217;ll get there.&#8221; If that sounds like a bit of a cop-out, don&#8217;t be too stressed.

There isn&#8217;t even something specific I want to work on, I need to work on everything. I need to be a better defender, make better decisions and improve my positional play. &#8220;If anything, I&#8217;m probably the guy who you can ask about our growing pains last year. I had to adapt to a different way of playing at the Boks than I&#8217;m used to at the Lions. It was quite difficult. That&#8217;s why people need to realise how important time is.&#8221; For now though, his attention is focused on making sure the Lions continue to fly the flag high for South Africa in this year&#8217;s Super Rugby campaign. &#8220;It&#8217;s about keeping it simple. We can&#8217;t think of reaching the final again. That will put us under unnecessary pressure,&#8221; says Mapoe. For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
