What better way to celebrate the start of the Super Rugby season than with two mouth-watering South African derbies this weekend? First up this afternoon, the Cheetahs host the Lions the success story of last year s campaign while the Bulls travel to Cape Town to meet the Stormers, who have consistently produced the goods in the preliminary phase in the competition over the past few years, but failed to replicate their form in the play-offs. South African rugby did not enjoy a good 2016. With the exception of the Lions reaching last year s Super Rugby final, there wasn t much cheer. The Springboks lost eight of their 12 internationals, including defeats to Ireland and Argentina on home soil and a first defeat by Italy on the end-of-year tour. Local rugby fans are desperate for something to smile about. The Sharks, in narrowly losing to the Reds in Brisbane on Friday, showed it is not all doom and gloom for South African rugby. The two derbies on Saturday, together with the Kings encounter against the Jaguares in Port Elizabeth, should give fans an indication of where our rugby is going.
