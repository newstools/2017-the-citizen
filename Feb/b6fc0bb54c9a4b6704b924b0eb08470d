As long as South Africa s national soccer side Bafana Bafana did not adopt a winning mentality, no amount of chopping and changing coaches will yield the desired results, Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini said on Tuesday. Delivering the keynote address to mark the official opening of the KwaZulu-Natal legislature at the Royal Showgrounds in Pietermaritzburg, the monarch reflected on how South Africa had performed since returning to the international arena, especially in sports. Because of the performance of the Springboks in winning the Rugby World Cup in 1995 and 2007 we felt proud as a nation and our soccer team won the African Nations Cup in 1996, said the king. He added however that Bafana Bafana no longer possessed the fighting spirit when compared to their rugby counterparts. When you look at the rugby team you get a sense of players going to war and prepared to put their bodies on the line. Bafana Bafana as a team is pathetic, said the monarch to some giggles in the audience. He said all players need to reflect whether they want to represent South Africa and demonstrate that on the field. The national team is currently looking for a new coach after Ephraim Shakes Mashaba was sacked in December last year.
