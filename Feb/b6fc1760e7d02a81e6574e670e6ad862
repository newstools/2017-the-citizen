Andile Mngxitama, leader of Black First Land First (BLF), has caused a row on social networking site Twitter after he suggested that Johannesburg mayor Herman Mashaba s drug den raid with the city s Metro Police Department (JMPD) in Rosettenville was anti-black and xenophobic. The raid, which will continue throughout the month of February, took place on Wednesday following protests, looting and the burning of an alleged drug dealer s house, where sex work allegedly took place, over the weekend. It is reported that young girls as young as nine were used for sex work in the house. Taking to his Twitter account on Thursday morning, the former Economic Freedom Fighters MP lambasted his former party, saying its leader Julius Malema&#8217;s decision to support the DA after the 2016 local government election was a vote for a neo-fascist mayor . Does EFF take responsibility for this anti black xenophobia taking us back to the pass system? They gave Joburg this mayor @SakinaKamwendo pic.twitter.com/yBt1XrZiJF &mdash; andile (@Mngxitama) February 9, 2017 The long-running debate on social media about the EFF allegedly selling out by voting in favour of a white party over the ANC, after the ruling party failed to secure majorities in three major metros, has been raging for a while. The red berets have brushed off the accusations, saying they would rather vote with a better devil in the form of the DA, rather than a corrupt devil . Mngxitama has recharged the debate again, particularly taking a swipe at the EFF after Mashaba and the JMPD checked the identity documents of foreign nationals living in Rosettenville. Who created the African borders? colonialists in 1885 in Berlin.
