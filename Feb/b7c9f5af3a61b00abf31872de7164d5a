The South African Police Service (SAPS) has refuted reports that police officers were involved in the eviction of students from Walter Sisulu University s Mthatha campus in the Eastern Cape. Earlier this week, the university s student representative council (SRC) president Sinelizwi Mantangayi reportedly said they were evicted from the campus by police; this after one of the campus buildings was set alight, allegedly by protesting students. Students from the East London and Mthatha campuses have been protesting against issues related to the university s registration process and the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) since the beginning of the week. According to university spokesperson Yonela Tukwayo the students were evicted by the university s security personnel and not police. It was handled by the university s security; the police don t get involved unless the situation becomes extremely volatile. Tukwayo said students would not be allowed to enter the university premises until things reverted back to normal. National police spokesperson Brigadier Sally de Beer said: Police members were not in any way involved in the eviction of students. The media which have incorrectly reported on this are requested to rectify their reports.
