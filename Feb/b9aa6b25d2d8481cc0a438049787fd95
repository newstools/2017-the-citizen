Two murder suspects will appear in a Free State court this week after police dogs helped track them down at the weekend. Free State police spokesperson Sergeant Mamello Mokhuoane said 54-year-old Wilfred Ernstig was murdered in his home in the small town of Hennenman on Sunday, February 5. His body was discovered by a neigbour who saw Ernstig s car being driven by a strange man and his female companion. Mokhuoane said the neighbour went to investigate and found all the doors locked. One of the bedroom windows was slightly ajar, however, and he could see Ernstig s body covered with a sheet in a pool of blood. His hands and legs had been tied up. The police were called to the scene and Mokhuoane said: Hennenman police activated all the SAPS roleplayers, including the Welkom K9 Unit. During preliminary investigations the deceased s car was spotted near Phomolong outside Hennenman. The police dogs were used to track down the suspects. The dogs led the police team to a nearby graveyard at Phomolong, not far from where the stolen car was recovered and, at the grave, the couple, a white male aged 52 and his wife, a coloured female aged 28, were found. Mokhuoane said the police dogs also found two of Ernstig s identity documents buried in the graveyard, as well as the car keys which had been thrown into bushes. The couple will be charged with murder and appear at the Hennenman Magistrate s Court this week.
