Members of the National Education Health and Allied Workers Union (Nehawu) at the National Financial Aid Scheme (Nsfas) in the Western Cape are preparing to down tools this week, the union said on Wednesday. Nehawu said it plans to shut down all Western Cape Nsfas operations on Thursday in the wake of the start of the new academic year. This comes as a result of the employer s unwillingness to take serious the concerns raised by the union about its flawed performance assessment process, which then culminated to the CCMA issuing a certificate of non-resolution, paving a way for the union to engage on strike action, Nehawu said in a statement on Wednesday.

The employer has been making empty promises that matters will be resolved and that an agreement to avert the strike would be tabled for both parties to sign, but to no avail. Nsfas is a national finance institution for students at universities and colleges. African News Agency For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
