Empangeni s Crime Intelligence officers returned to work on Tuesday after their offices were reopened as a dispute over rent was resolved. The estimated 40 officers found themselves locked out of their offices on Monday because of non-payment of the rent. They arrived at the building to find a notice reading: Notice. These premises have been locked due to non-payment of rental. By Management. However, on Tuesday, the Department of Public Works spokesman Thami Mchunu said the issue had been resolved and the management had reopened the premises. The Department of Public Works can confirm that there was a lockout at the CIU offices in Mpangeni because of non-payment. The non-payment was caused by a lease that expired in December 2016 and while the lease was being extended, the officials did not effect payment in order to avoid irregular expenditure, he said. He said that payment had been effected and that the landlord had been alerted to the payment. He had in turn opened the premises. The building, known as Property House, is located on Rex Henderson Road in Empangeni. African News Agency For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
