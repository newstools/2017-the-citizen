Eighteen Marikana mineworkers facing different charges following a violent strike in Marikana near Rustenburg in 2012, briefly appeared in the North West High Court on Monday. North West Judge president Monica Leeuw postponed the case to July 31, to allow the national director of public prosecutions to respond to the defence&#8217;s application. Anele Zonke, Xolani Nzuzu, Mzoxolo Magidiwana and 15 others are facing charges of murder, robbery, malicious damage to property and unlawful possession of firearm. The charges relate to the five days preceding August 16 2012, the day on which 34 mineworkers were killed by the police during a wildcat strike at Lonmin platinum mine operations in Marikana. The State alleges they killed two policemen, two Lonmin security officers and several non-striking workers. Since then, 19 mineworkers were arrested but Majeke Nonkonyana has since died. Zonke who is serving a sentence, was remanded in custody while the others had their bail extended until their appearance in court in July. Zonke was sentenced to 42 years in prison at the beginning on February, for the murder of Samancor Chrome mine s Human Resource manager Goodman Zalukano, and attempted murder of Thandi Zulakangana, in Kroondal near Rustenburg in 2014. Zalukano and Zulakangana were attacked by Zonke together with Sandiso Majaxa and Siyabulela Nqwilelo, when they come out from a shopping complex in Kroondal. Majaxa and Nqwilele were sentenced to 41 year jail term each for their part in the crime. During the attack Zulakangana, who was pregnant at the time, was shot and sustain serious injuries in her stomach; her unborn child was killed as a result.
