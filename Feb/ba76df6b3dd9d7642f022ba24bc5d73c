They don&#8217;t call Andile Phehlukwayo the next Lance Klusener because of the way he can whack a cricket ball. In fact, these two men&#8217;s gift is more priceless: they are unbelievably calm under pressure. Also read: Andile Phehlukwayo: The man who made AB de Villiers look junior Phehlukwayo showed that quality on Sunday when he guided the Proteas to victory in the first one-dayer against New Zealand in Hamilton. Other far more experienced men like AB de Villiers, JP Duminy and Faf du Plessis found the going tough on a &#8220;strange pitch&#8221; but not the 20-year-old all-rounder. He came in, never panicked and conquered. &#8220;I enjoy pressure situations,&#8221; said Phehlukwayo. &#8220;I try to give myself time to hit straight, execute my game plans and assess the conditions a lot quicker.&#8221; This is not the first time he&#8217;s done this &#8211; just ask the Cape Cobras and the Australians. Yet if you ask Roger Telemachus, who oversaw Phehlukwayo&#8217;s elevation into the national squad last season as the Dolphin&#8217;s stand-in coach, he&#8217;ll tell you that&#8217;s only half of the story. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever encountered a young man that cool under pressure,&#8221; said the former Proteas limited-overs seamer. &#8220;People always hammer on the importance of talent and skill to become an international player. We&#8217;ve seen enough talented men fall by the wayside. What will make Andile an exception is his calmness. &#8220;We underestimate being strong in the mind. Not everyone has that gift.&#8221; The humble Phehlukwayo hasn&#8217;t (yet) given much insight into how he keeps such a cool head. But there are some pointers. Also read: It&#8217;s a crazy world! Kagiso Rabada is a millionaire &#8230; at 21 The former national Under-19 star grew up in Port Shepstone, where his mother, Thando, worked as a domestic worker. She was the only breadwinner of the household and worked long hours to keep her boy in school. Her perseverance was rewarded when her son was spotted during a hockey festival and given a scholarship at Glenwood. The old worldview believes women are too emotional for young men to develop a sense of level-headedness and calmness. Phehlukwayo is proof of that. He grew up in a household with three women &#8211; mother, grandmother and sister &#8211; and that steely feminine influence has made him far more balanced than some would be willing to admit. Don&#8217;t underestimate though the power of a winning team to help him settle in. From when I first came into the side, you can sense the belief and energy in the squad. They re always backing each other, always positive. We re in a good, happy space, said Phehlukwayo. For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
