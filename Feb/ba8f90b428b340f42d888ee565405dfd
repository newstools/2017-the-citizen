Military ombud Temba Matanzima on Monday sent his condolences to the families of three South African National Defence Force (SANDF) soldiers who died on Friday during a freak accident at the Durban Naval Base. Retired Lieutenant General Matanzima commended the military personnel for their courage and bravery in trying to save the lives of civilians, which he said was the primary responsibility of all soldiers. The three South African Navy soldiers died when they rushed in to help the three construction workers from the Department of Public Works who had been overcome with toxic fumes whilst working in a sewer pit at the Naval Base in Durban. The three soldiers were then also overcome by the fumes and died. More than 20 other personnel were also reported affected and had to be treated. These men died as heroes as they put their lives on the line trying to save other people s lives, said Matanzima. Matanzima added: This tragic incident shocked many, just days before the South African Defence Force celebrates the Armed Forces Day in Durban.
