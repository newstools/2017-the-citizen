Ernie Els, South African golf&#8217;s favourite son, is not about to make any excuse for playing a round with controversial US president Donald Trump. The four-time Major winner and Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe were Trump&#8217;s guests at the Trump National Golf Club last week. South Africans fumed on social media as details of Els&#8217; fun with the president gradually started emerging. One user said the 48-year-old wasn&#8217;t a &#8220;credible person any more&#8221; while another tweeted he &#8220;can&#8217;t even like my favourite golfer any more&#8221;. But Els was emphatic in hitting back. &#8220;A lot of my own friends were not for him. They kind of needled me a little bit, saying I was a suck-up,&#8221; he told the Wall Street Journal ahead of this week&#8217;s Genesis Open at Riviera. &#8220;I just said, &#8216;Go eff yourself. I played with the President and you haven&#8217;t.&#8217; You can&#8217;t please everybody. It was just golf and a good time.&#8221; Earlier this week, Els also raved about how &#8220;impressive&#8221; Trump is. &#8220;It was one of the most special groups of people I&#8217;ve been around,&#8221; said Els. &#8220;I&#8217;ve played with the queen of Malaysia, I&#8217;ve played with other presidents, but this is the most powerful guy in the whole world and to see him in his full security detail, it&#8217;s impressive.&#8221; Apparently, Els and Trump&#8217;s discussions revolved around the American president supporting the South African&#8217;s autism foundation. Trump is a sponsor for the annual Els for Autism golf day. Ironically, details of the round of golf were supposed to be kept a secret. No media were allowed and a picture was even tweeted of the clubhouse&#8217;s windows being covered with plastic to obscure any view. Els owns a house in Florida.
