The SA netball team&#8217;s inaugural Quad Series campaign came to a disappointing close on Sunday night, as they were outplayed by New Zealand at the final leg in London. While the Proteas stayed in touch with the Silver Ferns in the early stages, and were three points behind (13-10) at the end of the first quarter, they were let down by their failure to convert enough turnovers and inaccuracy in the shooting circle. New Zealand took control in the second quarter and stormed clear to rack up a commanding 70-39 victory. The South Africans lost all six of their games in the inaugural four-nation series, which also included world champions Australia and England. The Australian Diamonds cemented their position as the top side in the world, going unbeaten throughout the campaign to lift the title.
