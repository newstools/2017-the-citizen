Faf du Plessis&#8217; summer to date has been about proving himself as the Proteas Test captain. It&#8217;s a challenge he&#8217;s passed with flying colours. On Wednesday at Kingsmead in Durban though, the 32-year-old stalwart reminded cricket fans of his ability to merely be a superb senior player. Du Plessis was the mainstay of the Proteas&#8217; charge to 307/6 in the second ODI against Sri Lanka, laying the platform for a victory by 121 runs. And to appreciate his brilliant 105 off 120 deliveries, one didn&#8217;t need to look much further than David Miller&#8217;s own hundred. The combative left-hander&#8217;s unbeaten 117 off 98 balls was a show-stopper, an innings that mixed impressive maturity with his well-known flair. But as brilliant as Miller was, he had the platform to work with that Du Plessis provided him. On a surprisingly sluggish pitch, Du Plessis had to consolidate after South Africa slumped to 108/4. Hashim Amla (14), Quinton de Kock (17), AB de Villiers (3) and JP Duminy (11) were all dismissed after misjudging the pace of the surface and would&#8217;ve been well served rather following Du Plessis&#8217; example. He waited for the ball to come onto the bat and picked his shots expertly. It was an innings of a man at ease with his game. Du Plessis clearly influenced Miller positively as the pair added 117 for the fifth wicket, gradually wearing down a Sri Lankan attack that couldn&#8217;t keep up their good start. When Du Plessis mistimed a slog to deep mid-on, the Proteas were still awkwardly placed at 225/5 but Chris Morris, another man who&#8217;s matured as a hitter, ensured the hosts would post a fine score. The Sri Lankan opening pair of Nilushan Dickwella (25) and Upul Tharanga (26) were initially on target before both were victims of brilliant catching. Du Plessis plucked a brilliant one-handed grab off a full-blooded Dickwella drive before De Villiers emulated his teammate with a fine catch running with his back to the ball. Wayne Parnell (2/34) was the beneficiary on both occasions. Predictably, the brittle and inexperienced middle-order thereafter struggled. Imran Tahir once again enjoyed himself immensely in taking 2/26, while the part-time spin of JP Duminy brought two cheap wickets as well. The Proteas, who lead 2-0, can now clinch an early series win in Saturday&#8217;s &#8220;Pink ODI&#8221; at the Wanderers. &nbsp; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
