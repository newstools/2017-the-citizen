It s a sensitive time to be asking possibly uninformed questions about homosexuality after the Grace Bible Church debacle, but Idols winner Khaya Mthethwa on Friday dived into the subject anyway. He was curious to know if women would date a straight guy who was gay . It seems innocent enough, except his followers detected something amiss in his logic: he assumes that gay people can simply turn straight. Ok can I ask; Ladies would u date a guy who was gay and now is straight!? If yes why &amp; if not why not? &mdash; Khaya Mthethwa (@khayamthethwa) February 3, 2017 Here are some of the responses: The term is bisexual. But hey, y&#39;all just ask questions. Screw knowing about the subject and screw marginalising people https://t.co/VuGlwrhiQ4 &mdash; @caterforall (@Slayvuyile) February 3, 2017 &nbsp; @khayamthethwa isn&#39;t that guy bisexual though, ay Khaya don&#39;t you people get tired of terrorizing other people all because of sexuality. Ay &mdash; Bobo West (@OkkerBobo) February 3, 2017 @khayamthethwa there no such thing as &quot;was gay&quot;. Its not something you just decide to stop doing &mdash; Dee (@DTshinyani) February 3, 2017 @khayamthethwa so one can turn straight from being gay?

Some of the singer s followers did take his question seriously though: @khayamthethwa I think it requires a special kind of grace because it takes a serious renewal of the mind and grace. Accepting him as he is &mdash; kop_raasery (@kop_raasery) February 3, 2017 @khayamthethwa Haha&#8230;. NOPE&#8230;A Leopard never changes its spots and some habits do not stop over night&#8230; Angifune after 9 arrangements! &mdash; SiphoosethuMd (@SiphoosethuMd) February 3, 2017 @khayamthethwa God forbid!!! How desperate can I be as a woman? That guy would have broken the code PERIOD!!! &mdash; Miss Percy (@PercyZuma1) February 3, 2017 https://twitter.com/mys_Tree/status/827499435856973824 @khayamthethwa I don&#39;t think anyone can be gay and then straight. To answer your question, yes I would date a bisexual man. Ts&amp;Cs apply. &mdash; Sinovuyo (@Cnovuyo_M) February 3, 2017
