Western Cape Economic Opportunities MEC Alan Winde on Monday welcomed the delegates of the Investing in African Mining Indaba to the Western Cape, saying the event formed an important part of the city s tourism calendar. The Investing in African Mining Indaba takes place at the Cape Town International Convention Centre from Monday to Thursday this week. In a statement, Winde said the Mining Indaba had attracted 6 000 delegates. The Investing in African Mining Indaba is the continent s largest mining event. They ve selected the Western Cape as their preferred destination to host this important networking event, Winde said. Boosting business tourism is one of the ways we will grow the size of the province s tourism sector. He said events and conferences were key economic drivers for the province. Conference delegates have a higher spend than leisure tourists and many return to the province on holidays with their families. In terms of events, we have a busy few months ahead. Sporting events such as the Cape Town Cycle Tour, Absa Cape Epic and the Cape Rouleur will bring thousands of domestic and international visitors to our destination.
