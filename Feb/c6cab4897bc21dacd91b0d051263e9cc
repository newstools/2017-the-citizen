That means Oosthuizen won&#8217;t be available for the Sharks&#8217; final tour game against the Brumbies in Canberra on Saturday as well as their first home game against the Waratahs the next week. The incident occurred in the ninth minute of the match. The SANZAAR foul play review committee of chairman Nigel Hampton, former Springbok wing Stefan Terblanche and John Langford assessed the case. In his finding, Hampton ruled the following: &#8220;Having conducted a detailed review of all the available evidence, including all camera angles and additional evidence, including from the player and submissions from his legal representative, Attie Heyns, the committee upheld the citing.&#8221; &#8220;With respect to the punishment, the committee deemed the act of foul play merited a mid-range entry point of four weeks. &#8220;However, taking into account mitigating factors including the player s good disciplinary record and early guilty plea the suspension was reduced to two weeks.&#8221; Nonetheless, it&#8217;s a big blow to Robert du Preez&#8217;s side. Oosthuizen, who also played for Jake White at the Brumbies, has improved gradually over the past few years and was on the few standouts in the 26-28 loss last weekend. Stephan Lewies, a one-cap Springbok, is expected to replace him. For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
