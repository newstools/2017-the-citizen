For some weird reason, Chris Morris continues to pop up as an &#8220;ideal&#8221; candidate to become South Africa&#8217;s latest Kolpak mercenary. At the height of last month&#8217;s drama regarding Kyle Abbott and Rilee Rossouw&#8217;s retirements from international cricket, the Proteas all-rounder&#8217;s name was regularly speculated to follow suit. But the genial 29-year-old on Wednesday gave the assurance once again that he&#8217;s fully committed to South African cricket. Also read: Danger! Proteas warned of SA-born Kiwi rookie &#8220;It&#8217;s something you&#8217;ve got accept as a player and a team,&#8221; said Morris. &#8220;It&#8217;s going to happen. All that matters is how the parties who are left behind deal with it. If a player wants to side a Kolpak it&#8217;s really his prerogative. We&#8217;re not going to judge someone on it. I&#8217;m committed and the team is committed. We&#8217;ve moved on from the Kolpak saga.&#8221; Lucrative overseas contracts, in fact, has been the furthest from Morris&#8217; mind the past few months. He&#8217;s had to recover from a knee injury that he was carrying for eight months before finally deciding to give himself a rest to recover fully. In that off-time, Morris has also been hard at work on his own game. &#8220;I&#8217;ve done a lot of work on my action in particular,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Consistency has been an issue for me in the past. I really want to eliminate the boundary balls I concede. It&#8217;s all about keeping straight lines.&#8221; Morris&#8217; focus on turning off the run taps is especially relevant given the Proteas&#8217; solitary T20 against New Zealand in Auckland on Friday. Also read: The Proteas will be sick of Hamilton after their NZ tour The venue, Eden Park, is a multi-purpose stadium perhaps better known for hosting rugby matches. As a result, the dimensions of the field are a bit unbalanced. For example, the straight boundaries are only 55m long &#8211; far too short in the modern era of T20 cricket actually. &#8220;It was a bit of a shock to my system when I got here to see the straight boundaries,&#8221; admitted Morris. &#8220;Every stadium has its own dynamics that we have to get used to so we will put the training to try and hit certain areas. It does change it a little bit but you have to adapt to every field that you play on.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
