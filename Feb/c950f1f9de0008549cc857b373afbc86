Five thousand needy students without money for fees attended lectures on Monday after the University of Johannesburg (UJ) settled their bills. Spokesperson Herman Esterhuizen said UJ raised R20 million through its SRC Trust fund to assist 5 000 needy students to enrol in the 2017 academic year. However, Esterhuizen warned that with the exception of NSFAS-qualifying students, all other students were required to pay registration and student fees before they could attend lectures. This is one of the important revenue streams that ensure the university can remain financially viable and able to do its core business of empowering thousands of young people, Esterhuizen said. He said UJ, which only accepts online registrations, has also implemented other measures to ensure students are able to benefit from the new academic year, which started on Monday. Students who are unable to pay their debt in full must make payment arrangements with student finance.
