Although he has not won for some time the Candice Bass- Robinson-trained Night Trip could be the right one to take out Race 6, a Pinnacle Stakes over 1400m at Scotts ville on Sunday. The Trippi gelding will have top-weight but comes into the race well weighted 1kg in with stable compan ion Ashton Park and better off with the balance of the field. Night Trip was runner-up behind Highway Explorer over an inadequate 1000m on the Polytrack in November and recently was third behind the fast improving Ama zon King. This longer distance suits him better and it is notewor thy that Anton Marcus will be aboard the seven-year-old. The Gareth van Zyl yard is ticking along nicely and Bu dapest is sure to prove a danger as the Lithuanian gelding likes this track. Ashton Park has been disappointing recently but is clearly not out of it. In a competive Race 5, a MR 70 Handicap over 1400m we could get a decent run from Roy s Stormer.
