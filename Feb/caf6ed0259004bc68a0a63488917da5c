Leicester&#8217;s Thai owners stunned the football world on Thursday by sacking the Italian just nine months after he led them to the Premier League title. Reports claimed seniors figures in the Leicester squad had lost faith with Ranieri&#8217;s tactical tinkering and team selections. But Shakespeare, Ranieri&#8217;s former assistant, dismissed reports that players had voiced concerns to the club&#8217;s hierarchy. &#8220;I&#8217;m not aware of any senior players going to the owners so that s news to me,&#8221; he told reporters. &#8220;From a football point of view I have to tell you that the players are very professional. They are very hurt and very frustrated. &#8220;I&#8217;ve not had one problem with them on the training field. They are very diligent and professional. &#8220;They will be very disappointed, like everybody else, that the manager has lost his job.&#8221; Shakespeare revealed he spoke briefly to Ranieri by telephone last night and described the Italian as &#8216;shocked&#8217;. &#8220;I&#8217;m very sad,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I think we all know in football these things can happen. &#8220;We have to make sure we remember him. He will go down with the utmost respect from everybody at this club.&#8221;
