The Mpumalanga Public Works MEC will have to pay R450 000 damages to a Benoni woman who was injured when her car overturned after she swerved to avoid a pothole, but hit another pothole on a badly maintained provincial road. In terms of a settlement reached in the High Court in Pretoria, the MEC has to pay the amount to Mara Swart. Swart, who was unemployed at the time, was on her way to Piet Retief in September 2012 when she overturned her car because of potholes. She sustained wounds on her forehead and injuries to her neck, back and right shoulder and her car was written off in the accident. She still experiences pain and will probably need a shoulder replacement. She was unable to return to her previous work as a cashier after the accident because of severe headaches and shoulder pain. Swart alleged in court papers the MEC and provincial employees had been negligent by not properly maintaining the road, failing to fix the many potholes in the road near Wakkerstroom and failing to warn motorists of the dangerous conditions on the road. The MEC initially denied any liability, claiming Swart was to blame for the accident. For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
