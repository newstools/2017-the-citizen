There&#8217;s every reason for Lwazi Mvovo to be at the heart of everything the Sharks do in their Super Rugby opener against the Reds in Brisbane on Friday. The Springbok winger will reach a remarkable milestone of a 100th cap in the tournament after being included in the Durbanites&#8217; starting line-up. Also read: Why Lwazi Mvovo and the Sharks&#8217; rookies need each other He&#8217;ll not only be motivated to make this special occasion memorable but also prove doubters wrong over his ability to be an international player. Mvovo was one of the victims in the Boks&#8217; poor campaign last year and was particularly exposed as a defender and catcher of a high ball. &#8220;It&#8217;s a massive achievement and I m pleased for him,&#8221; said Sharks coach Robert du Preez. &#8220;He&#8217;s a guy that sets high standards for himself and it s great to have someone with his experience in our set-up. He sets a good example for the young players and hopefully we can make it a memorable day for him.&#8221; Despite the Reds having strengthened their squad significantly in the off-season, the Sharks will fancy their chances. The halfback pairing of captain Pat Lambie and Cobus Reinach should give the backline direction, while the pack has a balanced look. The expected humid conditions also shouldn&#8217;t be unfamiliar for the Sharks as it mirrors Durban at this time of the year. &#8220;We&#8217;ve had two great training sessions over the last two days. The players are raring to go,&#8221; said Du Preez. Sharks: Curwin Bosch, Kobus van Wyk, Lukhanyo Am, Andre Esterhuizen, Lwazi Mvovo, Pat Lambie, Cobus Reinach, Tera Mtembu, Jean-Luc du Preez, Philip van der Walt, Ruan Botha, Etienne Oosthuizen, Coenie Oosthuizen, Franco Marais, Beast Mtawarira.
