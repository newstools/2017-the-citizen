Tumi Morake has been chosen as a Jaguar ambassador so don t be surprised if you see the first lady of comedy zipping to her next gig in a red Jag. I have always dreamt of driving a Jaguar and when I attended their launch last year, I had heart palpitations, said Morake. When I got to pick the colour, I thought that it has to be red, it has to be a colour that speaks to me, something that is out there, unique and exciting. I m a mom, but I also don t want to look like a boring mom. Morake s red F-PACE model combines Jaguar s sports car DNA with the practicality of a SUV. It has class-leading interior space for passengers and boot capacity of 463 litres. For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
