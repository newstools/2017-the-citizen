Last month on 8 January 2017, Rolene and her husband welcomed their baby boy into the world. She shared the following snap of her bundle of joy accompanied by the following caption: Welcome little Prince. You have stolen our hearts and filled it with the greatest Love and Joy imaginable. We are all healthy, happy and ever grateful for our 4.18 kg bundle of joy. My little boy, this world is your oyster &#x1f4ab;&#x1f4ab;&#x1f4ab; Today marks a special day for the Chairperson at The Strauss Foundation: She and her husband are celebrating their first wedding anniversary. Mrs Strauss took to her social media to share the good news about her milestone: Today a year ago we made a promise For better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, until death do us part. Unconditional Love persists. Thank you for being my rock, my support and the father of our son. I Love you #Anniversary Congratulations to Mrs Strauss and her knight in shining armour, we are very happy for you both and your families. Enjoy every moment of your beautiful journey together.
