President Jacob Zuma on Monday urged the nation to keep the South African rugby legend and former Springbok captain Joost van der Westhuizen in their thoughts and prayers . Van der Westhuizen, who was diagnosed with motor neuron disease in 2011, was hospitalised on Saturday. He remains in a critical but stable condition. Mr Van der Westhuizen is one of the best rugby players that the country has ever produced, said the presidency in a statement issued on behalf of Zuma. We are saddened by his ill health. We urge the nation to keep him and his family in their thoughts and prayers as he continues to fight this challenging illness.
