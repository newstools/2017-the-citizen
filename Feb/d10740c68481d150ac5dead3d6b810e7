Three people were injured, one seriously, when a car crashed into the back of a bus on the Vandyksdrift Road in Witbank, Mpumalanga, paramedics said on Saturday. Shortly before 4am on Saturday morning, paramedics from ER24 and other services arrived on the scene where they found the severely mangled wreck of a car, ER24 spokesman Werner Vermaak said. One person was found inside the vehicle with serious injuries. The local fire department had to use specialised tools to pry open the doors to gain access to him. Once freed, he was assessed and treated for his injuries. Two other occupants were treated on the scene for moderate injuries. It was understood that the car crashed into the back of a bus. However, when paramedics arrived, the bus was not found on the scene. Local authorities attended the scene and will investigate the cause of the collision, Vermaak said.
