What a difference a week makes! Last Sunday, the Blitzboks looked simply unstoppable as they romped to the Wellington title of this season&#8217;s World Sevens series. A quick trip over the Tasman Sea, to Sydney, has suddenly made them look vulnerable.

Neil Powell&#8217;s troops&#8217; big strength to date has been their ability to catch opponents off-guard on the counter-attack but, for once, they had to taste their own medicine. They had their first dose early in the match, when brilliant scavenging from Richard de Carpentier at a ruck delivered turnover ball to the English and allowed Phil Burgess to slow a clean pair of heels. Yet the Blitzboks seemed to have the game sewn up when they established a 15-7 lead shortly afterwards. The talismanic Seabelo Senatla, who once again thrilled a good crowd with six tries on day one, hit back with a dive in the corner before Justin Geduld launched a fabulous cross-kick for Chris Dry to collect. Geduld showcased his playmaking skills further when he dashed down the touchline &#8211; beating a defender in the process &#8211; to scored his own try. That was where the joy ended. Not to be denied, England brilliantly created a dummy overlap that was superbly finished by Dan Norton. And then came the ultimate case of using your opponent&#8217;s tactic against them. With the game in the balance at 15-14, super sub Ollie Lindsay-Hague did a &#8220;Geduld&#8221; by kicking a magnificent cross-kick for James Rodwell to collect. It was a fabulous end to a fabulous fightback. In retrospect, South Africa&#8217;s problem starting in their previous game, an arm-wrestle against Kenya that was narrowly won 14-7. The Blizboks committed numerous errors and were surprisingly undisciplined as their continental compatriots enjoyed a 7-0 advantage initially. But an untimely yellow card allowed Senatla &#8211; assisted ably by replacement Rosko Specman &#8211; to score a brace and save his side&#8217;s blushes. In their first game, South Africa comfortably beat Japan 32-0. They face the USA in Sunday&#8217;s cup quarterfinal. For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
