The Merseysiders have yet to win a Premier League match in 2017, taking just two points from a possible 12. As a result Jurgen Klopp&#8217;s side have dropped out of the top four for the first time since September and are 13 points adrift of table-toppers Chelsea. They managed a draw with Chelsea but their next match saw them beaten 2-0 at Hull on Saturday. Liverpool&#8217;s league losses so far this season &#8212; to Burnley, Bournemouth, Swansea and Hull &#8211; have all come against teams currently in the bottom nine. By contrast, Chelsea have dropped just two points in 12 matches against the bottom clubs, with Antonio Conte&#8217;s side holding on to 1-0 wins away to Middlesbrough, Crystal Palace and Sunderland. &#8220;You can see they have a lot of experience and that they are used to winning,&#8221; Lallana told Wednesday&#8217;s Liverpool Echo newspaper. &#8220;They know how to win games even when not at their best. You don&#8217;t have to always win by scoring five or six. &#8220;Maybe that&#8217;s an area we need to improve on. We maybe need to realise how good we are at times.&#8221; The England international added: &#8220;Milly (James Milner) is probably the only one in our group who has that type of experience because it only comes from winning silverware like he did at Manchester City. &#8220;Myself and the other players haven&#8217;t won titles or loads of cups so we need to learn from him and listen to him because that type of experience is vital. &#8220;We need to learn and get back to winning ways in the league as soon as possible.&#8221;
