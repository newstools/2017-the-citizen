This ferocious actress and radio personality has broken the internet more often than not in the past and did so again yesterday in a steamy photo shoot with PREVIDAR. We look at 5 times she set the internet of fire. Not her steamiest picture to date but Mbau shook the net when she posted this picture of herself in Calvin Klein underwear. The Weekend Edition co-host lit up MTV MAMAs red carpet last year in a skimpy purple and pink yellow dotted dress clears throught . Toward the end of 2016 Mbau wore a black bikini that displayed all her assets. The picture got over 10 thousand likes. And off course her recent nude shoot she did for Previdar.com has everyone talking. Khanyi Mbau also slayed again in black when she covered her curves in sexy lingerie.
