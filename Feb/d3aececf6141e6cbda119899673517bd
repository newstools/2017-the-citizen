Canada&#8217;s Eugenie Bouchard, ranked 45th in the WTA rankings after a third-round run at the Australian Open, has a date with a stranger after losing a Super Bowl bet. The 22-year-old Montreal-born blonde learned the hard way Sunday never to bet against Tom Brady and the New England Patriots, who rallied from a 25-point deficit to defeat Atlanta 34-28 in overtime to claim the NFL crown. With the Falcons comfortably ahead 21-0 after running back an intercepted Brady pass for a touchdown, Bouchard was confident enough in Atlanta to start sending Twitter messages predicting victory. &#8220;I knew Atlanta would win btw,&#8221; she tweeted, later adding, &#8220;Just predicted the future.&#8221; So that prompted TW1, a Twitter identity sporting a photo of a man in a Cleveland Cavaliers NBA jersey, to tweet Bouchard with a longshot bid of his own. &#8220;if patriots win we go on a date?&#8221; came the pitch. &#8220;Sure,&#8221; Bouchard replied, although she shot down a second such suitor with merely &#8220;C&#8217;mon&#8230;&#8221; As the Patriots made their successful second-half comeback, Bouchard was asked by another tweeter: &#8220;are you getting nervous?!? Lol.&#8221; &#8220;Umm&#8230;kinda&#8230;,&#8221; she replied, adding later, &#8220;So&#8230;where do you live?&#8221; When the Patriots won the game, and their fifth title with Brady as quarterback, Bouchard could only manage letters: &#8220;Omfg.&#8221; &#8220;Lesson learned,&#8221; Bouchard followed with later. &#8220;Never bet against Tom Brady.&#8221; On Monday, she tweeted a photo with the message: &#8220;Omg&#8230; last night really happened.&#8221; Realizing she had become a big deal in the Twitter-verse, Bouchard made it clear she would pay off and reward a date dreamer with an unlikely dream date. &#8220;Lol it made a Twitter moment,&#8221; she tweeted Monday. &#8220;And I will do it, I stay true to my word.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
