English rugby player Joe Marler has found the miracle cure for a broken leg: drink a litre of milk daily. The 26-year-old prop this week revealed his secret as his side prepare to start their Six Nations campaign against France on Saturday. To make the things even stranger, Marler didn&#8217;t even know he broke his leg! Also read: Can SA rugby work together? The Lions seem to think so&#8230; Less than a month ago, he started to feel pain during a warm-up before a match with his club Harlequins. As it turned out, Marler had actually broken his leg the week before but he played the full 80 minutes. &#8220;I rehabbed the hell out of it, to be honest, and drank lots of milk,&#8221; Marler said according to various news agencies. &#8220;There&#8217;s lots of calcium in milk, so that helps with the bones. And teeth. It&#8217;s not a new thing, it&#8217;s been around for years.&#8221; But it&#8217;s not just any milk that will do. Marler advises to drink full-fat milk &#8211; an intake of 1000 calories. That&#8217;s about 4200 kilojoules from just two big glasses! &#8220;I always thought green top was good for you because it s reduced fat but they gave me licence to have blue top,&#8221; said Marler. &#8220;The odd day I d have that gold top stuff, the one with like 1,000 calories. Maybe I won t carry on with that but blue top, it s been really good for me.&#8221; Comically, the English scrum enforcer thought his broken leg was a calf injury. &#8220;The trouble was I did it in the first half and just thought it was a calf knock and pulled my calf as well so there was a bit of confusion there,&#8221; said Marler. &#8220;I thought I could keep running on it because running is not really my forte anyway so I could get away with hobbling a bit.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
