Facebook user Eddie Prinsloo, who&#8217;s known to The Citizen as a lover of adventure on roads in SA and the world, took to Facebook to share how his middle-aged friend bought himself a big adventure touring motorcycle to be able to &#8220;clear his head&#8221; sometimes due to his turbulent relationship with his beautiful wife. Writing in Afrikaans, Prinsloo tells of his many memorable motorbike excursions on their big BMWs to &#8220;Roosendal, Blood River, Bezuidenhout&#8217;s Pass and Augrabies&#8221;. His friend told him once after a great day&#8217;s riding around their campfire that their getaways made him feel like the &#8220;Camel man&#8221; from the old adverts: &#8220;Rugged, tough and adventurous&#8221;. When Prinsloo called his friend one day to find out when next he&#8217;d be ready for a big getaway, he was told: &#8220;Sorry, I won&#8217;t be able to ride with you any more.&#8221; Turns out his wife had sold his bike for next to nothing on OLX. She scratched out her husband&#8217;s face on one of his photos with the bike and used that in an ad online with the words: &#8220;Good bike for sale. The husband has gone hunting. Contact the wife urgently.&#8221; Apparently, someone in Cape Town saw the ad, immediately made an internet transfer, flew up the next day to KwaZulu-Natal and made his way to Pietermaritzburg with his riding gear before enjoying a pleasant ride home on his new purchase. The wife supposedly made enough money to redecorate their lounge. Read the full account below, which Prinsloo assures us is completely true.
