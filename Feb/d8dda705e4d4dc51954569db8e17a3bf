Much to her fianc Umhlobo Wenene DJ Amaza Ntshanga&#8217;s disappointment, Bulelwa &#8216;Zahara&#8217; Mkutukana&#8217;s wedding has been put on hold for &#8220;various reasons&#8221;. Zahara said her busy schedule forced her to slow down on her wedding preparations. Her performances and the new album she is working on seem to be taking too much of her time, and as a result, she might even have to hire a wedding planner, though she would prefer to plan it herself. She is, however, hoping she will be able to manage her schedule and get married in August as initially planned. The Country Girl hitmaker had initially planned to get married in the first quarter of 2017. She told TimesLive that though her fianc was not happy about the delay, he was understanding. Though she did not want a big wedding, she said her family insisted on a big celebration, and Top Billing had asked to cover it.

Ntshanga used to send her to call his then-girlfriend, who was friends with her sister. The two separated and only met again when Zahara was 24, after releasing her debut album, Loliwe. At the time, Ntshanga loved the album so much he reportedly told his listeners he was going to marry the woman behind the voice, not knowing it was the little girl he used to send to call his then-girlfriend. They met, exchanged numbers, and the rest is history. Ntshanga kept his promise, and he has now paid lobola and will be marrying his love in perhaps the biggest wedding of 2017.
