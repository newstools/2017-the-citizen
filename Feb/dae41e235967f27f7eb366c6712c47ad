The blowback of public opinion gathered exponential momentum on Thursday after the release of health ombudsman Melagapuru Makgoba s report on the shocking deaths of 94 mentally ill patients. The Gauteng health department transferred them last year from the Life Esidimeni facility to a number of NGOs. The ombudsman said public revulsion at the number of deceased patients would very likely escalate as several corpses had yet to be identified. Qedani Mahlangu, the province s health MEC at the time of the first signs of what has turned out to be a category of failures to protect some of the most vulnerable patients, has resigned. The questions now are turning to exactly where the chain of culpability begins and ends in this sorry scandal. South Africans across demographic lines and political persuasions condemned the deaths and are united in backing the ombudsman s recommendation that proceedings be instituted against Dr Tiego Selebano for his conduct during the investigation, which included tampering with evidence. The ombudsman recommended that Gauteng Premier David Makhura should consider suspending him, pending his disciplinary hearing. Makhura has not emerged unscathed from the debacle. The EFF are calling him to account because the department of health failed to prioritise patients lives all in the name of saving costs . They want the former health MEC to face criminal charges and for Makhura to step down. Although it is premature to start the blame game, legal experts have opined that those deemed to be responsible for the deaths might well face criminal charges in court. And clearly someone must pay. But right now that does little to ease the hurt of bereaved relatives or to stem their angry tears. For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
