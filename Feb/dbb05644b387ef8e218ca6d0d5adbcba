Lewis Hamilton and his new Mercedes teammate Valtteri Bottas unveiled the W08 car they will pilot in the 2017 Formula One season at Silverstone on Thursday. The new car has a black, silver and teal chassis and has been produced to meet new regulations intended to make F1 cars faster and more demanding to drive. Three-time champion Hamilton gave the car a spin amid blustery conditions at Silverstone, 129km northwest of London, before posing for pictures alongside Bottas. &#8220;It is the most detailed piece of machinery I have seen in F1,&#8221; Hamilton said. &#8220;This is not an actual test &#8211; it&#8217;s just a few laps to make sure the car will run. But I was able to go faster in the last couple of laps. &#8220;It feels almost identical to last year&#8217;s car in terms of ergonomics, but you have this bigger, more powerful beast around you.&#8221; Briton Hamilton, 32, finished second in the last year&#8217;s Drivers&#8217; Championship behind team-mate Nico Rosberg, who abruptly retired at the end of the season. Bottas, a 27-year-old Finn, has joined from Williams to succeed Rosberg. Mercedes will be looking to secure a fourth successive Constructors&#8217; Championship when the 2017 season begins at the Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne on March 26.
