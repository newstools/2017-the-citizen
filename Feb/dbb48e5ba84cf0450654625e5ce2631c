After the realisation that beloved South African performers Mandoza, Sfiso Ncwane and Lundi Tyamara died at 38, those with time on their hands have been investigating the ages of public figures they despise to determine how much time they have before they reach that age. There is a meme circulating on Twitter from someone who so dislikes Economic Freedom Fighters CIC Julius Malema that they do not want him to miss his appointment with the age 38, said to be &#8220;the age of death&#8221;. The meme reads: &#8220;Mandoza died at age 38, Sfiso Ncwane at age 38, Lundi dies at 38. Malema is 37 this year, &#8216;My Lord make no mistake&#8217; &#8230; Amen.&#8221; Lol like why is Mzansi so cruel why shouldn&#39;t God make no mistake bcoz @Julius_S_Malema is turning 38 pic.twitter.com/r28xBLoYVk &mdash; palesa majongile (@palesamajongile) February 2, 2017 Malema saw the meme, retweeted it and further reminded the creator of the meme he still had a few more years to live, as he was turning 36 this year, not 37. @palesamajongile I&#39;m turning 36 &mdash; Julius Sello Malema (@Julius_S_Malema) February 2, 2017 So if &#8220;the age of death&#8221; is anything to go by, Malema fortunately still has a few more years to shake up parliament. And besides, the last we checked, Malema was a politician, not a musician. The CIC&#8217;s followers commented on the meme and wished him to live longer than Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe. In fact, some said they wished he were born earlier so he could have been part of the negotiations alongside former president Nelson Mandela. Last year, member of the ANC Thabang Shozi faced condemnation for wishing Malema was the one who died in a car accident in 2002, instead of former leader of the SA Students Congress (Sasco) Siphiwe Zuma. I wish you died instead of him, Shozi said to Malema s tweet in which he commemorated the death of Zuma. Zuma died three days after being involved in a car crash in 2002. Malema was a passenger in the car but survived the crash. Read more: Malema insulted Zuma, says ANC man who wishes him dead &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
