The matter was transferred to the regional court where the the trial against Nonthutuzelo Jack was expected to get underway, however, she was not at court on Wednesday due to a fractured leg. The prosecution was supplied with a medical certificate which was handed in to the court. Forty-seven-year old Jack from Tshwete Village, is accused of defaming Trollip by claiming he offered her a bribe to dig up dirt on DA provincial chairwoman Veliswa Mvenya. Jack made the claims to a newspaper and they were published last year in the run up to the 2016 local government elections. According to the charge sheet, Jack is facing a charge of criminal defamation for falsely accusing Trollip of having offered her money in exchange for working for his faction in the party, digging up dirt on Mvenya and adding her name to the DA s candidate list for the 2016 municipal elections. The alleged offence was committed at a time when the party was campaigning and identifying its candidates for party and public positions. The charge sheet further reads that Jack deposed of an affidavit containing false accusations and forwarded it to DA Federal Executive Chairperson and MP James Selfe. Selfe is responsible for investigating the party s legal affairs and disputes between members. Trollip is the complainant in the matter. The case was postponed to March 6 and a warrant of arrest was held over until a further date. -African News Agency For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
