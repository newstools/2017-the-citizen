Powerfully-built Springbok centre Rohan Janse van Rensburg knows what makes the Lions tick and doesn&#8217;t need any convincing to buy into their dream. In fact, ahead of Saturday s Super Rugby opener against the Cheetahs in Bloemfontein, the 22-year-old playmaker will be one of the most important figures in the Lions&#8217; drive towards that dream.

The camaraderie and belief and support for each other is just awesome,&#8221; he said. &#8220;As a Lions team we want to improve as a whole. It doesn t matter whether you play a New Zealand or Australian side, we always want to play our brand of rugby. That&#8217;s our only focus. The Lions surprised all and sundry in 2016 with a brilliant campaign, where they finished as runners-up and scored the most points. As a result, the only possible way to exceed last season&#8217;s high standards is to, well, win the tournament. For Janse van Rensburg though, it&#8217;s about maintaining a balance: improving without putting unnecessary pressure on oneself. &#8220;There s always something you can improve on. There s never a perfect campaign, there s always something you are going to regret or didn t work out the way you wanted it to work out,&#8221; he said. But returning to the Lions camp is always special, there s a warming feeling that you can t experience anywhere else. I&#8217;m looking forward to the new season, it s going to be exciting. Not that the Lions can expect to merely rock up and start the season well against their provincial neighbours, who are the Currie Cup champions. &nbsp; &#8220;We are really looking forward to the first game against the Cheetahs. It s going to be again a long season and the first game is always a good measure where you stand as a team,&#8221; said Janse van Rensburg. But it&#8217;s not just possible &#8220;second-season syndrome&#8221; that Johan Ackermann&#8217;s troops need to guard against. They are also now a group of players whose stock has risen as they gradually become international players.

Now that you have achieved something, people start looking more at you with a magnifying glass,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It s a great challenge, pressure is not something that must drive you into the ground, you have to rise above that. I don t see it as pressure but rather as a nice test and challenge as a player. It also helps you realise the imporantce of performing as a collective again. The full cupboard of centres available to the coaching staff means Janse van Renburg can&#8217;t become complacent. No less than five specialist centres have been included in the Lions&#8217; Super Rugby squad. Every day when you train you have to be at your best. You know that if you didn t have a great session or game, there s a chance you might not play,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It keeps you on your toes and ensures that you know everything you should know and do what s expected of you on the park.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter. &nbsp;
