Kiernan &#8216;AKA&#8217; Forbes and Bonang Matheba have broken up. AKA took to Twitter on Friday night to announce the heartbreaking news. &#8220;Sad to announce that myself and @bonang_m have broken up. We tried guys,&#8221; wrote AKA. He further went on to tell his fans not to love a woman more than she loves them. Bonang, as usual, has not said anything on her social media accounts. Some of their fans have, however, said the announcement could be a publicity stunt, with one claiming that he saw them together at Pepper Club Hotel earlier today. Some have believed the SupaMega, saying karma has served AKA for cheating on his baby mama, DJ Zinhle. Only time will tell if this is real or just another publicity stunt. At my fucking LIMIT for bullshit. &mdash; AKA (@akaworldwide) February 17, 2017 https://twitter.com/akaworldwide/status/832636294836547588 https://twitter.com/akaworldwide/status/832600289974841345 &nbsp; The two recently went on a trip to Thailand and Hong Kong, with Bonang being featured in The World Is Yours music video, leaving fans thinking they were a forever couple. Before that, AKA took Bonang to Cape Town to meet his family. Also read: PICS: Bonang finally meets AKA s family For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
