Robbie Fleck&#8217;s Stormers were the most impressive South African side in the first weekend of Super Rugby by some distance. Good tactical awareness and surprisingly decent execution were features of the Capetonians&#8217; performance, especially during the first half of a 37-24 victory over the Bulls. But injury headaches are a concern &#8230; and it&#8217;s not only confined to the Stormers. Champagne rugby from the Stormers but there are hitches Given their fairly dominant performance, the last thing the Stormers would&#8217;ve wanted was a disruption to their squad. However, that will be the case as Springbok centre Damian de Allende is potentially out for an extended period. &#8220;He suffered an ankle injury and I don&#8217;t want to get into it until we know the extent of the injury but from the initial news we received, it does not look good,&#8221; said coach Robbie Fleck.

EW made some excellent decisions. He will now play a big role for us,&#8221; said Fleck. The Stormers also need to keep their concentration levels up after slacking off after half-time. &#8220;Maybe it was a little bit of enthusiasm that got the better of us but it&#8217;s small things and we can fix it,&#8221; said Fleck. Bulls can&#8217;t expect to run with the ball if they are so poor in the set-pieces Nollis Marais&#8217; side are on a journey towards playing more attractive rugby. But as they neighbours the Lions will tell them, you can&#8217;t do that without a good platform. &#8220;Rugby remains a basic game where you need to do the small things better than your opponents &#8211; maul, set-pieces, scrums,&#8221; said Marais. &#8220;We have the game and we have the players but if you want to play against the best, you need to do the small things right.&#8221; He was encouraged though by his troops scoring 24 points in the second half. Rohan Janse van Rensburg might just avoid a common sickness Second-season syndrome is a real threat and many sportsmen have been victims. The 22-year-old Lions centre, who had breakthrough year in 2016, has carried his form into 2017, scoring two tries in a tough 28-25 win over the Cheetahs. Johan Ackermann, his coach, hailed him being a &#8220;X-factor player&#8221; and that&#8217;s encouraging. But there&#8217;s work ahead for last year&#8217;s runners-up.

We haven&#8217;t played a lot together so I&#8217;m happy to have won,&#8221; said Ackermann. Depth at centre will be affected as the Lions have lost Howard Mnisi for nine months with a knee injury. It&#8217;s a big loss. Franco Smith, Ackermann&#8217;s counterpart at the Cheetahs, rued his side&#8217;s inexperience. &#8220;The players need to realise their Super Rugby players now, not a Currie Cup or varsity side.&#8221; Kings can&#8217;t just start and end well There were times during the Kings&#8217; 26-39 loss to the Jaguares that they really didn&#8217;t look like one of the weaker sides. Coach Deon Davids believes that was due to them playing well in patches. Also read: Brave but limited Kings fall short against Jaguares &#8220;We started and ended well but in-between there was rhythm lacking,&#8221; he said. Another problem is that the men from Port Elizabeth need to make sure they use their experienced props to dominate the scrums. That didn&#8217;t happen. &#8220;There needs to be quality ball from the set-pieces. If we kick, we need to apply pressure. We also need to play rugby in our opposition&#8217;s half. It&#8217;s about being balanced,&#8221; said Davids. Sharks only need to minimise their mistakes It was close but no cigar for the Sharks as they lost 26-28 to the Reds in Brisbane. But for long periods, they led on the scoreboard and made use of their counterattacking opportunities. Mistakes at crucial times sunk them. &#8220;We had to make more tackles that we would have liked and our discipline wasn t as good as we hoped for. We did show character there but just disappointed we didn t get our hands on the ball enough and attack more,&#8221; said captain Pat Lambie. If that can be turned around, the Durbanites could be good this season. For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
