Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe celebrated his 93rd birthday with a lavish party on Saturday attended by thousands of loyalists outside the second city of Bulawayo. The ruling ZANU-PF party hosted the event for Mugabe, who has held power since 1980 during a reign marked by repression of dissent, vote-rigging and the country&#8217;s economic collapse. Now the world&#8217;s oldest national leader, his actual birthday on Tuesday has been honoured in a week-long extravaganza with state media filled with tributes and praise. The party &#8212; held in a large marquee decorated with portraits of a younger Mugabe &#8212; included a feast and several vast birthday cakes, angering some Zimbabweans as the country endures severe food shortages. One of cakes was shaped like Mugabe&#8217;s official Mercedes Benz limousine. Holding the event at a school in Matobo has also riled locals as it is close to where many victims of Mugabe&#8217;s deadly crackdown on dissidents in the early 1980s are thought to be buried. At least 20,000 people are believed to have been killed in the massacres by North Korean-trained Zimbabwean troops, according to rights groups. &#8220;This should not be a place for celebration,&#8221; Mbuso Fuzwayo, spokesman for the Bulawayo-based campaign group Ibhetshu Likazulu, told AFP. &#8220;The whole area is a crime scene where the bones of victims of the massacres are buried.&#8221; &#8211; Increasingly frail &#8211; Mugabe gave a faltering television interview this week, vowing to remain in power despite growing signs of frailty. During the pre-recorded birthday broadcast, Mugabe paused at length between sentences and spoke with his eyes barely open. &#8220;The call to step down must come from my party,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If I feel that I can&#8217;t do it any more, I will say so to my party so that they relieve me. But for now, I think I can&#8217;t say so.&#8221; The state-owned Herald newspaper on Tuesday published a 24-page supplement of congratulatory messages from government departments and regime loyalists. &#8220;It s written on earth and in heaven that our leader is RG Mugabe,&#8221;ZANU-PF national youth leader Kudzai Chipanga told guests at the party. &#8220;We find it hard and impossible to talk about any other leader except yourself.&#8221; ZANU-PF has endorsed Mugabe as its candidate for general elections next year, and he remains widely respected as a liberation hero by other African leaders. Party guests &#8212; some dressed in clothing that showed Mugabe&#8217;s image &#8212; chanted &#8220;Long live the African icon&#8221; before the president&#8217;s speech expected later in the afternoon. He has avoided naming a successor, but his wife, Grace, 51, is seen as a possible candidate along with vice-president Emmerson Mnangagwa. A coalition of opposition activism group said in statement that the party was &#8220;a mockery and a direct insult to the concerns of the citizens&#8221;, alleging that poor farmers had been forced to donate cattle to feed guests. Born on February 21, 1924, Mugabe trained as a teacher and taught in what was then Rhodesia and Ghana before returning home to join the guerrilla war against white-minority rule. He became prime minister on Zimbabwe&#8217;s independence from Britain in 1980 and then president in 1987. All schools around Bulawayo were closed on Thursday and Friday to prepare for the celebrations. &#8220;Our children were told their classrooms have been turned into boarding facilities, and they are being frogmarched to join the birthday party,&#8221; local poet and opposition activist Desire Moyo told AFP.
