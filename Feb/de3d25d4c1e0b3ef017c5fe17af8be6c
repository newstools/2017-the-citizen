Afrikaans rapper Jack Parow is set to tour South Africa to release his own brand of brandy. Parow Brandy is a three-year premium hand-crafted brandy. It was created by Jack Parow to fill the gap in the local market for a premium, locally-produced brandy. It s produced by a small cellar in Montagu. The brandy will be exclusively stocked in Checkers country-wide in February. From March it will be available countrywide at various outlets. Parow Brandy is the house brandy at The Good Luck Bar in Johannesburg and at all RocoMamas restaurants countrywide and is rolling out to other bars and restaurants soon.
