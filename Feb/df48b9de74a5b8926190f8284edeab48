South Africans in the Western Cape may celebrate a lot of things, however, Valentine&#8217;s Day does not seem to be one of them. According a survey done by OnlineCasting, the day, meant to be celebrated by lovers, is becoming less popular. The study has revealed that Google Trends has showed that online searches about Valentine&#8217;s Day have been on the decline since 2006. Northern Cape was found to be the province that celebrates the day of love the most, followed by the Free State, KwaZulu-Natal, Limpopo and Eastern Cape. Gauteng, Mpumalanga and North West were also at the bottom of the list, reports Daily Sun. On the contrary, Mother&#8217;s Day was found to be growing in popularity since 2007, compared to Father&#8217;s Day that has not increased in popularity since 2010. &nbsp;
