A group of 12 athletes from underprivileged areas across the Western Cape are set to participate in the Sainte D vote Tournament, a rugby sevens tournament, held in Monaco in March 2017. In a statement, the South African Rugby Legends Association (Sarla) said their partnership with the Princess Charlene of Monaco Foundation and Cell C have made it possible for a group of young budding rugby stars to experience the thrill of an international tournament. The tournament will include teams from around the world and South African youth will be taking part for the third time this year. My involvement with the sport of rugby has shown me how it encourages players to develop values such as team spirit, fun, fellowship, solidarity, and good sportsmanship, Gavin Varejes, President of Sarla said. The South African youngsters selected for the Sainte D vote Tournament will benefit immensely from the experience and we hope that it will inspire them to work hard and achieve other successes both on and off the field. The Sarla, said the tournament is a social upliftment aimed at giving young children from underprivileged areas the chance of a lifetime to travel to an exciting new destination, with cultural exchanges and fun activities. Sarla s CEO, Stefan Terblanche said they were honoured to be invited to send a team to the tournament once more. Making dreams a reality for rugby-loving kids is a huge part of what Sarla wants to achieve, and this is an opportunity to do just that, said Terblanche.
