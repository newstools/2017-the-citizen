Dodoma. Confusion rocked the Parliament yesterday with MPs divided over donating their sitting allowances to the national Under-17 soccer team, Serengeti Boys.This forced House Speaker Job Ndugai to rule in support of the donation.After the question and answer session, Speaker Ndugai introduced the team to the MPs.The team paid the House a courtesy visit after qualifying for the 2017 Africa Youth Championship finals to be held in Gabon in April.The Under-17 team players were welcomed by heavy round of applause by all MPs.However, all hell broke loose when Ms Esther Bulaya (Bunda Urban-Chadema) requested Speaker s guidance and went on to suggest for all MPs to donate their yesterday s sitting allowance, Sh220,000 per MP for the team s cause. All MPs here love sports. We have been longing to participate in major international tournaments and our boys here have done us proud by making it to the finals of the Africa Youth Championship, she said adding: We have all heard that their budget is Sh1 billion, I thus ask for your guidance, honorable Speaker, out of patriotism that we also play our part by contributing from our sitting allowances. Before she concluded her motion, some of the legislators angrily interrupted and dismissed it, chanting Nooo, we don t want to contribute just speak for yourself don t force us There were, however, some of the MPs who stood behind Ms Bulaya s motion, including Mr Ally Keissy (Nkasi North-CCM), who said, recently Uganda qualified for Afcon, and before the team flew to the finals in Gabbon, their MPs donated, let s also do the same today, empty applauses won t help these boys. Raising the voice of the Opposition, Khatib Said Haji (CUF-Konde) said the issue of donating to the team should not be forced upon all MPs, but only those willing should continue with it. This Parliament should not be turned into an avenue of fundraising for each and everything, let those who wish to contribute do so out of their will, he said.
