When Robert du Preez named his Sharks touring squad for the start of their Super Rugby campaign on Thursday, he didn&#8217;t hesitate to immediately make a big call. Pundits were quick to pounce of his decision to pick Sibusiso Nkosi over the more experienced S&#8217;bura Sithole. Yet when it&#8217;s considered the 20-year-old winger was called &#8220;Lomu&#8221; after finishing school at Jeppe in Johannesburg, one suddenly understands why. Also read: Siyanda Grey and Kings keep their goals simple and spirits high Nkosi, a Baby Bok in last year&#8217;s World Junior Championship, is indeed a hefty fellow in the mould of the late All Black legend Jonah Lomu. He&#8217;s not necessarily tall at 1.81m but he&#8217;s got bulk at 97kg. And some fine performances in the pre-season certainly helped too. &#8220;Sbu has worked incredibly hard these past few months,&#8221; said Du Preez. &#8220;One thing that helped is that we know what S&#8217;bra offers, he&#8217;s been here a while. But at the moment, we just feel Sbu is a step ahead of him at the moment. &#8220;It&#8217;s a long season that&#8217;s ahead and we haven&#8217;t even played a game yet. Both have a chance to stake a claim.&#8221; Nkosi&#8217;s promotion continues an interesting local trend in the build-up to the season. He&#8217;s the second youngster to date who&#8217;s unexpectedly played himself into the spotlight. The Lions this week included Under-19 star Madosh Tambwe in their group and has a decent chance of making his debut even given the injury to Springbok wing Ruan Combrinck. Du Preez&#8217;s commitment to youth is further evident in the big responsibility he&#8217;s giving Curwin Bosch. The talented utility back made his mark in last year&#8217;s Currie Cup and his versatility has led to team management not picking an extra flyhalf as backup to Bok and captain Pat Lambie. &#8220;We were debating on whether to take a second pivot with us. We had a few options in Garth April, Benhard Janse van Rensburg and Inny Radebe,&#8221; said Du Preez. &#8220;But I rather want them to get more game-time than they would be able to get on tour. There was very little to choose between them. Curwin is very talented and we feel he&#8217;d be able to cover for Pat at flyhalf. He is considered as our fullback though.&#8221; The Sharks kick off their campaign with two away games against the Reds and Brumbies in Brisbane and Canberra respectively.
