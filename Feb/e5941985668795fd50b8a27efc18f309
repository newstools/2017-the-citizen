Tropical cyclone Dineo has been making headlines, with most simply being afraid of the damage the storm might cause to their homes, or to be more precise, the wrecked homes it might leave in its wake. But most women on Twitter have been wondering why the storm was given a name mostly given to women, complaining that it implied that women caused havoc everywhere they went. Cyclones are named alphabetically, and it just so happened that this time, it was a named given mostly to women. The name has seen people on Twitter sharing stories about the Dineos in their lives, who are &#8220;problematic&#8221;, with some saying the Dineos they know are sweet. DJ MoFlava also joined in on the conversation about the name and said it was an interesting name for a tropical cyclone. &#8220;Surely names like Bon&#8230; never mind,&#8221; he said, leaving most thinking he was talking about Bonang Matheba. Even she thought he might have been talking about her name, as she responded and told him to finish off his name suggestion. He further suggested names such as Bontle and Bonolo, and also considered Bonang, after she responded to his tweet. &#8230;.heleletsa.
