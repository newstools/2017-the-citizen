The father of two, Shiven Ramsunder, who worked as a block-man at Emam Bux, had left work a while before the shooting occurred. While circumstances surrounding the shooting are still sketchy, emotional staff at Emam Bux, together with the management team, shared their sentiments regarding the horrific incident, Rising Sun Chatsworth reported. Shiven was in the prime of his life, and he was an excellent staff member. His tragic death has shocked us all. We sympathise with his family and want them to know that his passing is not only a loss to them, but a loss to us as well. &#8220;He was not just an employee. He was a friend and a part of our family. He will be dearly missed, they said. &#8211; Caxton News Service For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter .
