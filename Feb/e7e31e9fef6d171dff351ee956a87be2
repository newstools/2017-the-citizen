The Proteas are hoping a sluggish pitch won&#8217;t spoil Saturday&#8217;s traditional &#8220;pink&#8221; One-day International at the Wanderers against Sri Lanka. This annual fixture is known for being a run-fest, usually in front of a sell-out crowd. That&#8217;s illustrated by South Africa&#8217;s totals down the years &#8211; 343/6 (Pakistan, 2013), 358/4 (India, 2013), 439/2 (West Indies, 2015). Even last year&#8217;s last gasp 266/9 against England was compelling in its own way. But the ghost of the 2nd T20 here a few weeks back still haunts the hosts. Also read: Proteas complain about &#8216;disappointing&#8217; Wanderers pitch The Proteas were annoyed over a slow, low surface that played right into Sri Lanka&#8217;s hands, defying Test captain Faf du Plessis&#8217; call for pitches that benefit South Africa. &#8220;I fully support Faf in that regard,&#8221; AB de Villiers, the Proteas ODI skipper, said on Friday. &#8220;Everywhere around the world, home teams try to cash in on home-ground advantage. We don&#8217;t want to make conditions ridiculously difficult for opponents but we want pitches to suit our strengths. Touring is supposed to be challenging.&#8221; In fact, South Africa can argue with some justification that the strips in the current ODI series haven&#8217;t quite been ideal. St George&#8217;s Park&#8217;s pitch looked worn, while the Proteas&#8217; 307 at Kingsmead was deceptive on a slow track. Yet De Villiers didn&#8217;t want to complain. &#8220;The groundsmen probably haven&#8217;t gotten it right the past few weeks,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I really don&#8217;t want to single out any ground. We&#8217;re past that now. We also can&#8217;t really complain because we&#8217;ve won a couple of games now. This wicket looks really good.&#8221; However, fast, competitive wickets don&#8217;t only need to be prepared merely to suit the Proteas. There&#8217;s also an ICC Champions Trophy in England in mid-year to consider. South Africa&#8217;s seamer-friendly wickets are similar to those in the UK. Also read: David Miller&#8217;s rotten luck continues &#8220;We do chat to the groundsmen. That&#8217;s the idea, we want wickets that mirror England,&#8221; said De Villiers. &#8220;Obviously first and foremost, we want to win the series. But preparing for England can&#8217;t hurt. Unfortunately, grounds don&#8217;t always get it right. &#8220;It happens all around the word.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
