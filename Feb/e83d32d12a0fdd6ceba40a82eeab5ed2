by Ian WHITTELL A talismanic figure in City&#8217;s two Premier League title wins, Aguero was left out of the starting line-up for this week&#8217;s Premier League wins over West Ham United and Swansea City as Jesus scored three times. While he was keen to insist he wants to see out a contract at the Etihad Stadium that runs until 2020, the 28-year-old conceded the decision is out of his hands. &#8220;I will work hard for the remaining three months and then we&#8217;ll see if the club wants me,&#8221; Aguero told reporters after Sunday&#8217;s 2-1 home win over Swansea. &#8220;I want to stay. &#8220;I am fine. It is normal. Sometimes this happens. When you&#8217;re on the bench, you have to wait for your opportunity. &#8220;I have to help the team as much as I can in these three months. Afterwards we&#8217;ll see what the club wants to do with me.&#8221; Guardiola has already held one meeting with Aguero and his agent, which followed the arrival of 27 million ($33.6 million, 31.3 million euros) new recruit Jesus in the January transfer window. Asked about the contents of that meeting, Aguero replied: &#8220;Things to do with the club, nothing strange. Private things that have to stay inside those walls. &#8220;In three years my contract is up. That&#8217;s why I say I&#8217;m happy at the club.&#8221; Guardiola has insisted that Jesus and Aguero could partner each other in the same team and the more senior of the two players admitted he has been impressed by what he has seen so far. &#8220;He&#8217;s a great player,&#8221; Aguero said. &#8220;He&#8217;s a very young player, but he will learn a lot at City and he will have a great future at the club. &#8220;At the moment I have to watch what he does, to learn. It could be a little bit. I am how I am. I have spent a lot of years in Europe playing the same way. &#8220;Sometimes this happens. When you&#8217;re on the bench you have to wait for your opportunity. I have three months to do my best and try to help the team and we&#8217;ll see what happens with my future.&#8221; Guardiola said he had been pleased by Aguero&#8217;s response to being left out of the team. &#8220;His reaction was perfect. Don&#8217;t worry about that,&#8221; said the City manager, whose side have climbed to third place in the table. &#8220;Of course he wants to play and it mustn&#8217;t be easy. I understand that. &#8220;Sergio remains one of the most important players in our squad and with what we have to do in the next period, he will be so, so important.&#8221;
