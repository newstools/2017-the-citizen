I capitalised on a good shot in the play-off with a great putt. Overall, the 18th was pretty good to me.&#8221; Tracy also birdied the par-four 17th in a closing 6-under 65 at Bogota Country Club. Diaz, from Mexico, birdied the 16th and 18th for a 64. They finished at 13-under 271. &#8220;I was trying to make it,&#8221; Tracy said. &#8220;I knew 13 was the number. I was going to get it all the way back to that pin and, if it went over, so be it. I had to give it a chance.&#8221; Making his fourth career start on the tour, the 27-year-old former Arkansas player earned R1.7 million after missing the cuts in the tour&#8217;s opening two events in the Bahamas.
