The story about Panda, a husky that went missing on January 21 ended on a sweet note when the lucky pup was reunited with her owner, Barry le Roux. An excited and emotional, le Roux told the Highway Mail he could not stop crying when he received a call on Thursday morning from the Kloof and Highway SPCA informing him that somebody had dropped off his beloved pet. Le Roux said that he was told by two security guards from the Pine Crest Shopping Centre that they saw a dog being put into a Hilux double cab bakkie at the traffic lights. Last week Highway Mail published an article about le Roux offering a reward of R 2000 for Panda s safe return. Le Roux said he believes that Panda was stolen, but is glad she is home safe and was not abused. I have two other huskies and they are all like our kids. My wife and I do not have children, he said. &#8211; Caxton News Service For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter .
