There are times when the best handicapped horses are not fancied to win a plate race as there are other factors that negate the weight advantage. That looks to be the case at Fairview on tuesday when they race on the Polytrack. Race 4 is a Conditions Plate over 2200m and Crown Of Gold is the horse handicapped to win. However, there are two factors which count against him the distance and the track. For this fellow, still going strong at the age of eight, it is a case of the further the better. His favourite race is the PE Gold Cup over 3600m, the longest race in South Africa, in which he has raced three times for three wins. He is likely to find this 2200m too short and has finished unplaced in two races on the Polytrack. So it is worth looking elsewhere for the winner and that is tough because there is so much conflicting form. With racing at Turffontein tomorrow night a number of Highveld jockeys are staying at home and Warren Kennedy makes the trip to Port Elizabeth to ride for Gavin Smith. After a lean spell the stable is back in form and they could team up to win with Matador In Red. On the Polytrack he has the beating of Dreamforest who in turn has the beating of Global Express. There is little to choose between Alghadeer and Masterly although the former does have a slight edge and then there is Kingston Mines. This will be his first start on the Polytrack and he could be anything. For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
