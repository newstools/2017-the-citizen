Since Ntombezinhle &#8216;DJ Zinhle&#8217; Jiyane started posting pictures of herself with her boyfriend, Brendon Naidoo, some on social media say she is only trying to convince people she no longer loves her ex-boyfriend, Kiernan &#8216;AKA&#8217; Forbes. Zinhle found herself on the Twitter trends list on Thursday morning after posting a picture of herself on Instagram in her house holding flowers and writing: &#8220;Rose petals on the dinner table and a bunch of roses were the last things I expected when he told me we were having dinner tonight. God bless my man. Thank you for a perfect day baby.&#8221; Rose petals on the dinner table and a bunch of roses were the last things I expected when he told me we were having dinner tonight. God bless my man. Thank you for a perfect day baby @brendonnaidoo A photo posted by ZINHLE JIYANE (@djzinhle) on Feb 8, 2017 at 11:52am PST Being a celebrity, Zinhle always gets negative comments, even on positive posts, and usually, she ignores the haters, but not this time. She responded to a comment that seemed to imply she was competing with her baby daddy&#8217;s girlfriend, Bonang Matheba, who also posted a picture of flowers her man bought her on Tuesday. &#8230;.just got home!! These were waiting for me&#8230; &#x1f648;&#x1f648;&#x1f648;&#x1f60d; &#x1f451; Thank you boo&#8230; Love you!! #100Roses #Spoilt (The framed image and everything. OMG! &#x1f629;&#x1f629;&#x1f629; I can&#8217;t take it. &#x1f60d;&#x1f60d;&#x1f60d;&#x1f60d;) A photo posted by Bonang Matheba (@bonang_m) on Feb 6, 2017 at 7:20am PST &#8220;Zinhle, my love, let&#8217;s not be too obvious. A certain someone posted similar caption two days ago. Hayibo,&#8221; said user bubblinggee. The DJ&#8217;s fans jumped to her defence, telling &#8220;Bonang fan&#8221; Bubblinggee to let Zinhle be and said she posted pictures of flowers everyone bought, not just the ones from her boyfriend. However, it was Zinhle&#8217;s comment that shut down the whole conversation with one lengthy comment. She wrote: &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know other people also walked into dinner and found rose petals and roses waiting for them if they did. Good for them. My man did something amazing, and I posted it. I love flowers, and my man knows it. Couples buy each other flowers all the time. I am sure there are a million other men who bought flowers for their women. &#8220;I know that it is entertaining for you and your friends to think that I do things to compete with anyone. Unfortunately I&#8217;m too old, and I would never do that to my man. As much as you say you didn&#8217;t mean it in a malicious way, yes you did. &#8220;You are not the first one, I&#8217;ve seen a lot of women who&#8217;ve never been through what I&#8217;ve been through share unkind words and think it&#8217;s okay cause I&#8217;m just a celebrity. I&#8217;m actually more than that, I&#8217;m a woman who had to pick up the pieces for her shattered life. I forgave myself and moved on. I worked on my healing and God blessed me with a beautiful man but people like you don&#8217;t think I suffered enough so you come here looking for other ways to make sure I&#8217;m in more hurt. It won&#8217;t work. &#8220;I have moved on and I suggest you do too. God bless you. I hope you don&#8217;t do this to your friends. Would be so sad to have a friend who does what you just tried to do,&#8221; she wrote. Well, we guess no one will be posting nasty comments on Zinhle&#8217;s posts anymore.
