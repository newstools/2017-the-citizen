Gospel singer Lundi Tyamara made a great contribution in the national effort towards nation-building and social cohesion through song, Arts and Culture Minister Nathi Mthethwa said on Sunday. As a country we ended 2016 and started 2017 in a sombre mood, he said at Tyamara s funeral service in Worcester in the Western Cape. The untimely passing of Mandoza and Sifiso Ncwane in 2016 shocked our people. As if the pain of losing the two artists was not enough we opened 2017 with the passing of a jazz icon Thandi Klaasen of a generation that preserved our sanity and humanity through song under extreme difficulties. As we were laying Mama Thandi Klassen to rest, another gospel artist Lundi Tyamara departed this world; all these tragedies came at a time when our country needs their wisdom and contribution towards our efforts in nation building and social cohesion, he said. The good deeds of Lundi are not interred with his bones but are with us. We, the title holders of his deeds, must advance them further for the betterment of society; this is what he wanted. Development of any society cannot succeed if the youth does not play its role because you are the future. The realisation of the ideals of a united, non-racial, non-sexist, democratic, and prosperous society rests on your shoulders, Mthethwa said. African News Agency (ANA)
