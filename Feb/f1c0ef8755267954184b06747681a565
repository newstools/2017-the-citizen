There are chaotic scenes at the Loftus Versfeld Stadium in Tshwane after Orlando Pirates supporters took to the field with their side 6-0 down against Mamelodi Sundowns. After Percy Tau scored Sundowns sixth with 10 minutes to play, disgruntled Bucs fans stormed the field. With security over-run, the players had to flee for their lives as violent scenes broke out across the stands and on the field. Officials are considering continuing play, but it would be surprising if the match does continue. There have been pictures of injured and bloodied supporters, while teargas has been used and television broadcasting equipment destroyed. #Sundowns #Pirates pic.twitter.com/nCdieBRySH &mdash; Nwabisa (@TheeNororo) February 11, 2017 Situation at #lotus #Sundowns pic.twitter.com/YRmTei84fu &mdash; Lehuma Nthite (@PNthite) February 11, 2017 Game still suspended #Sundowns #Loftus pic.twitter.com/PzIdW7x1dy &mdash; Lehuma Nthite (@PNthite) February 11, 2017 #Sundowns we salute Sundowns fans for not fighting back the pirates pic.twitter.com/53LsI7uaSA &mdash; Adolph (@Adolph_89) February 11, 2017 African News Agency (ANA) For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
