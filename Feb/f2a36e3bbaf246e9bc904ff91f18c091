A woman believed to be 36 years old had to be put on advanced life support after being shot in an attempted robbery at the Msunduzi River in Pietermaritzburg on Saturday morning, KwaZulu-Natal paramedics said. It s believed that the woman and her mother were approached by a man with a gun while sitting next to the river, ER24 spokesperson Annine Dormehl said. The man apparently asked for the keys to their car and when the woman resisted a shot was fired. She sustained a wound to the right side of her abdomen. ER24 paramedics arrived at the scene just before 10am and stabilised the woman before transporting her to Mediclinic Pietermaritzburg. It s believed that the suspect had fled the scene before the SAPS [South African Police Service] dog unit and ER24 paramedics arrived. Local authorities were on the scene for further investigation, Dormehl said. African News Agency (ANA) For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
