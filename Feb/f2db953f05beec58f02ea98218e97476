The stigma of shame will linger like a dark cloud over the once proud Orlando Pirates after the weekend of thuggery generated by sections of the club s supporters ironically nicknamed the Happy People at Loftus in Pretoria. Enraged by the six goals slammed past them by defending Premiership champions Mamelodi Sundownsr, sections of the crowd went on the rampage. They ripped out seats and invaded the field, causing players and match officials to flee before police managed to get the mayhem under control. But 13 spectators had to be hospitalised. This outbreak of terrace violence raises urgent questions, chief among them match security, which we would suggest was sadly lacking at Loftus as was the case some years ago at FNB Stadium, when Pirates supporters caused similar chaos in a derby against Kaizer Chiefs. Aligned to this is the upsurge of sudden and sustained anger understood to be fuelled by excessive liquor intake in the stands, which was unchecked. The immediate answer would seem to be a total liquor ban at all stadiums, a move unlikely to have the approval of soccer followers or the blessing of the league with already shrinking gate numbers at live games. But it s an embargo which has to be urgently implemented if soccer is to even begin to live up to its definition as the beautiful game. There must also be a strong response from the PSL, where Pirates boss Irvin Khoza finds himself in the invidious position of serving as league chairperson and vice-president of the South African Football Association. The aftermath threatens to be as fraught with recriminations as last week s violent scuffles in parliament. Clearly though, something drastic will have to be done.
