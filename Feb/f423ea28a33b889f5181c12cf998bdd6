Some tantalising head-to-head clashes will set off the national athletics season when the inaugural ASA Speed Series goes down to King s Park Athletics Stadium, Durban on Tuesday. The evening meeting sees 2016 Rio Olympic Games finalists Elroy Gelant and Namakoe Nkhasi going in as favourites in a 16-strong field in the men s 10 000m. Gelant, the South African with a Personal Best of 27:41.30 in the event, will show us the results of his Kenyan camp where he was preparing for the 2017 season. He will battle fellow Olympian and Lesotho national champion Nkhasi who has a 28:06.33 to his name. The pick of the 5 000m women s field, is the showdown between Lebogang Phalula and Kesa Molotsane, who boast PBs of 16:02.55 and 16:20.26, respectively. Runners in the 10 000m men and 5 000m women s contests will be trying to impress national selectors for a place in the final team to the IAAF Cross Country Championships to be held in Kampala, Uganda on March 26. To bring the curtain down on what promises to be an exciting two hours competitive evening, all eyes will be glued on the 100m men s race, which could offer some exciting performances. South African 100m national record holder Akani Simbine, with 9.87 on his clock, stormed to a fifth-place finish at the 2016 Rio Olympics and had a brilliant start to the last season. He faces Anaso Jobodwana, who has a 10.10 PB in the distance and was a worthy bronze medallist at the 2015 IAAF World Championships in the 200m. Jobodwana spent most of the last season nursing an injury, which cost him in the Rio de Janeiro Olympics. In the first hour of the programme, there will be four relay medley races for boys and girls, plus a 1 500m men s race. This elite national season opener will also include a 200m dash for women and 400m contests for men and women. For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
