Noah From Goa and Light The Lights will be aimed next at the Group 1 Jebel Hatta over 1800m on Super Saturday, 4 March, at Meydan. They finished second and fifth respectively to Championship in last Thursday s Group 2 Zabeel Mile. Trainer Mike de Kock com mented: Noah From Goa was beaten fair and square. He ran a good race, I think he still has a length or two in the tank. Christophe Soumillon reckons he will see out the 1800m of the Jebel Hatta. Light The Lights carried just a little extra condition, he will have no problems with the 1800m and should be stripped on the night. mikedekockracing.com
