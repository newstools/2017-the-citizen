Anton Marcus, who won last year s Prix du Cap on the Brett Crawford-trained Cuvee Brut, will be reunited with Cape Fillies Guineas winner Just Sensual in the R250,000 Grade 3 Vasco Taverna Prix du Cap over 1400m at Kenilworth s famed Prawn Festival meeting on Satur day. Frankie Dettori took over on the Joey Ramsden-trained filly for the $500,000 CTS Mile on Sun Met Day but he was faced with an outside draw and was soon in front. The filly faded in the clos ing stages to finish only 11th. This time Just Sensual is drawn No 1. Silver Mountain, winner of last season s Cape Fillies Guin eas, could prove the three-year-old s biggest threat. In-form Aldo Domeyer, who won the December 2015 classic on her, will be back on board for the first time since finishing second on her in the CTS Million Dollar in January last year. The Candice Bass-Robinson-trained filly had to contend with a terrible draw when only fifth in the Grade 1 Klawervlei Majorca last time but here she is drawn a far more favourable eight. The ever-improving Goodtime Gal, third in the Majorca, has fared badly in the draw which could well play an important part over this trip. She is drawn 13 out of 14 with only the Justin Snaith-trained A Time To Dream outside her. Bass-Robinson, whose father Mike won three of the last seven runnings, has the biggest hand with four runners the others be ing Come Fly With Me, Miss Mark er and Whose That Girl.
