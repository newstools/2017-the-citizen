by Tom WILLIAMS The Liverpool manager Klopp could be seen exchanging words with a fan standing behind the dug-outs after a first-half back-pass towards goalkeeper Simon Mignolet was met by a collective groan around Anfield. Klopp said his side were committed to building play from the back and asked supporters not to allow their impatience to get the better of them. &#8220;If we don&#8217;t play possession football tonight, it&#8217;s ping-pong,&#8221; Klopp told reporters after Tuesday&#8217;s game. &#8220;We played high pressure, so Chelsea does it smart, plays a few long balls. If we do the same, you have a stiff neck after the game. &#8220;So we had to play football and that includes sometimes you play a back-pass. And then I hear in this moment (shouts): &#8216;Why you play a back-pass?&#8217; &#8220;Keep your nerve, please. It&#8217;s still football. I have no problem with emotion. I have much more emotions than I should have. But it&#8217;s in this moment (I think), &#8216;What do you want?&#8217; &#8220;It was only one guy, by the way, that I made eye contact with. Blue jacket.&#8221; The draw preserved the 10-point gap separating the sides, but meant Liverpool, who remain fourth, avoided four successive home defeats for the first time since 1923. Chelsea took a 24th-minute lead when David Luiz&#8217;s quickly taken free-kick caught out Mignolet as he tried to organise his defence, the ball cannoning in off his right-hand post. Georginio Wijnaldum equalised with a 57th-minute header before Mignolet atoned by saving a penalty from Diego Costa, awarded for a foul on the Chelsea striker by Joel Matip. Klopp celebrated Mignolet&#8217;s penalty save by roaring in the face of fourth official Neil Swarbrick, but said the pair had later made peace. &#8211; Arsenal next for Chelsea &#8211; &#8220;It was a foul before in my opinion on (Dejan) Lovren, that&#8217;s what I was a little angry about,&#8221; Klopp said. &#8220;No one can beat us, was what I said (to Swarbrick). Obviously that&#8217;s not true, but it felt for us like this in that moment. &#8220;I was absolutely the wrong person to say it. I said: &#8216;Sorry, I was a bit excited.&#8217; He said: &#8216;No problem, I like your passion.'&#8221; Liverpool&#8217;s supporters felt Costa went down too easily after being caught by Matip, but Klopp said he had no qualms with the combative Chelsea striker. &#8220;If I had played against Costa, I could never be friends &#8212; that&#8217;s how it is &#8212; but when you have him in your team it&#8217;s much more fun. He is a warrior,&#8221; said Klopp. &#8220;What (Antonio) Conte is doing with Chelsea is outstanding, but Chelsea without Costa this season? &#8220;He is not the nicest guy on the pitch, but I saw no real big incident. &#8220;If someone tells me it was a dive, maybe I will be angry tomorrow, but that would be wrong decision what, number 27? But it doesn&#8217;t make it better.&#8221; Despite Costa&#8217;s squandered penalty, Arsenal&#8217;s loss to Watford and Tottenham Hotspur&#8217;s goalless draw at struggling Sunderland made it a good night for Chelsea manager Antonio Conte. &#8220;It is not easy to play against Liverpool in this moment after three defeats. It is not easy to play in this atmosphere,&#8221; said Conte, whose side sit nine points clear ahead of Arsenal&#8217;s visit on Saturday. &#8220;I am very proud of my players for the personality they showed tonight. It is a good point, for sure. &#8220;When you have a good chance with a penalty in the 76th minute then you think you could win and take three points, but Mignolet made a great save. &#8220;Now it is important to recover well as we wasted a lot of energy because the game was intense and there were a lot of mistakes.&#8221;
