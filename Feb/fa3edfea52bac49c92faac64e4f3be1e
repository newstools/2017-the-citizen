African National Congress (ANC) MP Makhosi Khoza on Tuesday confirmed she was being moved out of her position on Parliament s Standing Committee on Finance, but said she did not know why, despite speculation that her departure was intended to make way for former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe. If you want to know about my appointment and being moved, the first person to speak to is Jackson Mthembu because he is the one that is responsible, at least in this institution, for the deployment of ANC member, Khoza said on the sidelines of Parliament s ad-hoc committee probing the affairs of the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) board. Khoza is a member of the ad-hoc committee. Khoza said a letter informing her of her new role in the portfolio committee on public service and administration was dated February 8, but she only received it last week. I can confirm that I am in the public service and administration, I am their new chair now but it s going to be confirmed tomorrow [Wednesday] when I am being officially appointed, it will be happening tomorrow morning if we have the quorum. Opposition parties have cried foul over Molefe s deployment to Parliament, saying he was being groomed for a position in Parliament s finance committee and speculated this was his gateway into the finance ministry.
