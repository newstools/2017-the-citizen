In December 2015, before the Manchester City manager had arrived in England, Arter and his partner Rachel&#8217;s daughter Renee was stillborn, prompting an outpouring of sympathy for the midfielder and his family. Guardiola was seen talking to Arter after City&#8217;s 2-0 win away to Bournemouth in the Premier League on Monday. Explaining what the Spaniard had said to him, Arter told the Daily Echo: &#8220;He offered his best wishes for me and my partner this week, which was an unbelievable touch. &#8220;He is someone I have a massive amount of respect for. I watched his Barcelona teams, and look at his Manchester City side. &#8220;For me, he is the best manager in the world. I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anybody close to him and what he has achieved. &#8220;For him to offer that to me, I respected it and accepted it with a smile on my face.&#8221; Guardiola had previously relayed the details of his side of the conversation at his post-match press conference. &#8220;He (Arter) will be a father soon so I said big congratulations to him and his partner because I know what happened in the past, and, hopefully, the baby will be well,&#8221; said Guardiola.
