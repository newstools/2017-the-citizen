Dam levels in the drought stricken Western Cape have dropped further, falling from 33.2 percent last week to 31.2 percent at present, the province s minister for environmental affairs said on Monday. The average water level for dams across the Western Cape has dropped to 31 percent, MEC Anton Bredell said, citing data from the national department of water. In the same week last year, dam levels in the province were at an average 40 percent. Bredell urged people living in the Western Cape to step up efforts to conserve water and restrict usage. The biggest short-term opportunities in response to the immediate water crisis, currently lies in non-revenue water reduction, private reuse and recycling, and water conservation and demand management investments. These types of plans and interventions are no silver bullets given the challenges we face, but there can be little doubt that the work being done contributes significantly to addressing the water challenge.
