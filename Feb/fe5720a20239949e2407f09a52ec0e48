A field guide has shared his delight at capturing a bonding moment between a white-headed vulture and a warthog at the Sweni Waterhole in the Kruger National Park. Taking to the SANParks &#8211; Kruger National Park Facebook page on February 1, the guide, Matthew Mc Donald, shared his photograph and said that while he spends most of his days in the Kruger, this moment is one of his highlights. &#8220;We think we have seen or learnt it all, and it&#8217;s these moments that make working in the bush even more grateful,&#8221; said Mc Donald. He added that the vulture was seen giving the warthog a &#8220;good groom&#8221;. Read the full post here: A screenshot of Matthew Mc Donald&#8217;s post on Facebook.
