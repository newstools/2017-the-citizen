A very rare all-turf race meeting at Greyville today promises a difficult card but we will look for some value. Bizjet in Race 5, a MR 78 Handicap over 1400m could fit the bill nicely. This six-year-old has always been best around this distance and although drawn very wide should run a decent race. The Jet Master gelding was touched off at Scottsville over this distance in October the last time he ran on the turf. Both his trainer, Colin Scott, and rider, Muzi Yeni, are in decent form. The biggest threat could come from the improving three-year-old Wild Wicket. This Dynasty gelding clearly needed his first two starts and has come on nicely since then. Wild Wicket won full of running over Scottsville 1400m last month. The best bet on the card could be Roman Emperor in the opening race. This Duncan Howells trained three-year-old needed his sprint debut and improved when put over the longer distance of 2000m next time out. Roman Emperor did his best work late behind stable companion Portman Square. It is his first try on the turf but that should not be a problem.
