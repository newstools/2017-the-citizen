After 23 years of highly competitive motorsport at Audi AG, Dr Wolfgang Ullrich is to step down. The 66 year old Head of Motorsport will hand control to Dieter Gass, no newcomer to the scene and the choice of Ullrich as his successor. Ullrich s career is testimony to his ability as a team leader in one of the most demanding jobs in the automotive world. Highlights include 13 wins at the Le Mans 24 Hour Race, numerous victories and championships in super touring cars and DTM, involvement with racing partnerships and commitment to Formula E. It was Ullrich who bought Gass back into the Audi fold in 2012 and has involved him in many aspects of the division. The retiring head was complimentary when he said Dieter Gass is going to lead Audi Sport through the upcoming transformation stage and continue to write Audi s success story in motorsport; he knows Audi Sport like few others do. From November 1994 to March 2001, he worked there as an engineer, initially in the super touring car and subsequently in the sports prototype programme. &#8220;Afterwards, he held leading positions in Formula One for eleven years. In that period, he gathered a wealth of know-how that Audi Sport has been benefiting from ever since his return in 2012. &#8220;Following one year as Head of Racing Commitments and four years as Head of DTM, he is now taking his next, carefully planned step. I will be assisting him in this role in an advisory capacity, but not in the operational side of the business. I know that Audi s motorsport commitment is in good hands with Dieter Gass. Ullrich will remain for the 2017 season in an advisory capacity. It will be interesting to see which direction the team targets following the company s recent decision to withdraw from the WEC.
