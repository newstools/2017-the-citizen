Goods imports amounted to $234.9 million, down from $294.9 million recorded in the corresponding period in 2015, mainly due to a decline in imports of consumer goods, industrial raw materials and intermediate goods.Tanzania s exports of goods and services in the year ended October 2016 rose to $251.8 million from $151.9 million during the same period.In October 2016, monthly average world market prices for the selected agricultural and non-agricultural commodities showed mixed developments. The prices of coffee, cotton, tea and oil increased while, that of cloves, sisal and gold declined.Prices of coffee and cotton went up mainly due to high global demand.

The price of tea in Mombasa remained at $22.2 per kg. The prices of crude oil and white petroleum products went up largely due to a fall in crude oil inventories in the US and a rise in optimism that Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries will cut production.As for gold, the price declined due a rise in speculation that the Federal Reserve will increase interest rate and hence reduce the demand for gold as a safe haven.
