Kenilworth racecourse in Cape Town was buzzing on Saturday for one of the biggest social events of the year, the 2017 L Oramins Queen s Plate. In its 156th year, this event has remained a spectacle not to be missed. Hosting Cape Town and Johannesburg celebrities, the Stud Club marquee was where you wanted to be to rub shoulders with Mzansi Magic s Rockville actress Boity Thulo, SABC3 Afternoon Express hosts Bonnie Hana and Jennie D Moses, as well as other radio and TV personalities. Dressed in the event s colours of blue and white, fashionistas from all parts of the country came out in their numbers in an effort to grace Western Cape s social pages. The mood was one of excitement as the sound of clinking champagne glasses filled the air. Some had luck on their side as the horses they backed to win or place came home.

It was only fitting to end things with a musical touch as 947FM DJ Euphonik got some of the ladies to relax, kick off their heels and groove to soothing sounds.
