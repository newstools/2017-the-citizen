More than 100 parents from Mamelodi in Pretoria east, burned tyres on Tsamaya road to display their frustrations over the new online registration system on Tuesday. In 2016, the department introduced an online registration process for Grade one and eight pupils, but many parents have claimed that the system is ineffective. The Gauteng Education Department still has 58,000 pupils to place into schools. The new registration system requires parents to fill in their information on a portal, which allows schools to accept or decline a pupil s admission. Parents were meant to get SMSes by Monday and they said they are still waiting. The frustrated parents were pushing for the old walk-in system.

Rantho, 26, said she applied for her daughter in April, but until now nothing has happened. This is frustrating because we haven t bought uniforms, we don t even know the schools where our children will be placed, Rantho said. The parents have vowed to continue with the protest and close down schools if the situation is not immediately addressed. Meanwhile, more frustrated parents have been queuing at district offices in Soweto since the early hours of Monday morning. The department said its systems were offline for the festive season, but were back online from Monday. It claimed the backlog was due to late registrations, but they promised that every child would be placed. African News Agency For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
