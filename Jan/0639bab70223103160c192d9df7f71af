In exactly one month, former American president Barack Obama will finally relive his years in the White House with South African audiences during the premiere of the global-release documentary President Obama: In His Own Words. This will be Obama s first-hand account of his time in office his successes, his failures, difficulties with Congress, race relations during his tenure and what a Donald Trump presidency ultimately means to his legacy. In profound and candid new interviews with the former president, conducted before and after the 2016 presidential election, the two-hour special is a unique examination of the Obama presidency from the inside out. In 2009, Obama was inaugurated as the 44th president of the United States. Celebrated as the first African-American president, Obama campaigned using the slogan Change We Can Believe In, and for many embodied the promise of what it meant to be an American. But the country he had been elected to lead was facing one of its most difficult times ever with a dire economic crisis looming. Eight years later, as Trump takes over as new president, the legacy of Obama is being considered and debated. While historians will consider the Obama administration for decades to come, ultimately there is no more powerful perspective than that of the former president himself. President Obama: In His Own Words also includes unprecedented access and interviews with members of Obama s staff, Congress and the press, including Vice-President Joe Biden; Secretary of State John Kerry; Secretary of Treasury Tim Geithner; Attorney-General Eric Holder; National Security Advisor Susan Rice; Chief of Staff Denis McDonough; Senior Advisor Valerie Jarett; Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes; former Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel; former Education Secretary Arne Duncan; and Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid.
