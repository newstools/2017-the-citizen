But still he does not want to contribute anything. I received a call from Mbuso&#8217;s elder brother Ndaba telling me Mbuso was arrested. He asked me if the arrest had anything to do with my case and I told him the court had issued a warrant for his arrest, but the police had not told me they had arrested him,&#8221; the woman is quoted as saying. Ndaba said he had been paying R4 000 a month for Mbuso&#8217;s child and there was no need for the arrest. &#8220;Did she see the money physically? She must appreciate we are supporting her child,&#8221; Ndaba said of the inheritance. For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
