The Proteas&#8217; selection panel have an important yet pleasant first order of business in 2017: appointing Faf du Plessis&#8217; deputy. Linda Zondi, convenor of selectors, stated a few weeks back that the issue would be debated thoroughly this month before a full-time candidate is recommended.

It&#8217;s not merely a title.&#8221; Much like personal relationships in general, the theory behind an effective captaincy combo is that opposites attract. &#8220;I certainly believe in that,&#8221; said Matthews. &#8220;A vice-captain should complement his skipper, I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s necessarily a good idea to have two players who have the same approach to cricket. &#8220;You want a guy who has a different view on matters, because then a side tends to combine its decision-making ability to the best of its potential.&#8221; Given that Du Plessis&#8217; captaincy style is more about smart tactical leadership and remaining calm, the winning recipe might be picking a bit more of a free-spirited deputy. But is it really as simple as that? &#8220;Faf is an interesting captain. He always looks in control but there&#8217;s a hard-nosed and adventurous streak too. We saw it in Australia,&#8221; said Matthews. &#8220;Yet my gut feel is his deputy needs to be a bit more brash.&#8221; A guy like Dean Elgar, the Proteas&#8217; gritty opener, would seem to be a viable candidate as he&#8217;s established himself as a senior player and also has captaincy experience. Matthews, however, feels that when a player is eventually appointed, he shouldn&#8217;t immediately deputise for Du Plessis if he&#8217;s absent. &#8220;It&#8217;s a common mistake that&#8217;s made,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You want your new vice-captain to settle into his new role and not shoulder him with the extra responsibility of the captain. &#8220;If Faf is absent for whatever reason, I&#8217;d rather have Hashim Amla or AB de Villiers lead temporarily until the new vice-captain is more experienced.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
