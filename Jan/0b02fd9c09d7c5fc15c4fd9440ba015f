The Blitzboks emerged triumphantly from a group considered difficult as they ended the first day of the Wellington Sevens tournament unbeaten. In a massive statement of intent, Neil Powell&#8217;s charges swatted Fiji aside by 31-12 in their last game of the day with a powerful performance after beating Japan and Australia 33-0 and 26-0 respectively. Seabelo Senatla, playing his penultimate tournament before focusing on 15-man rugby with the Stormers, was a poacher of note as he dotted down for two tries against the Islanders. In fact, South Africa showed their versatility by actually out-attacking the Fijians instead of trying to play counter-attacking rugby. It was a gamble that paid off brilliantly. Earlier, the Blitzboks had some early difficulty in their skirmish with the Aussies. They only led by 7-0 at the break thanks to fine interplay by Kok and Senatla but their impressive work-rate on defence would prove decisive in the second half. A searing hit by Rosko Specman saw the Wallabies cough up possession, allowing Shakes Soyizwapi to score and gaining South Africa the foothold they needed. Dylan Sage and Chris Dry put the icing on the cake as they crossed the tryline too. In their first match of the day, the Blitzboks had little difficulty disposing of Japan. Senatla headlined his side&#8217;s opening act with a brace of tries but it was the collective effort that was vital. South Africa already led by 26-0 at the turnaround.
