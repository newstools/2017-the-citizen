The outgoing chairperson of the African Union Commission (AUC), Dr Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, has welcomed the lifting of economic sanctions by the United States of America on the Republic of Sudan. Dlamini-Zuma acknowledged the importance of this development which will allow Sudan to reengage in international trade and end the suffering of its people. Furthermore, the AUC chairperson welcomed the commencement of discussions on the modalities for the lifting of the sanctions, especially after several appeals from the AU, particularly the Declaration of the AU Heads of States and Government at their 26th Ordinary Session of January 30-31 2016. Dlamini-Zuma said she appreciates US President Barack Obama for this constructive decision and hoped that the in-coming administration would consider permanent revocation of the sanctions in Executive Orders 13067 and 13412 and further work towards granting debt relief to the Republic of Sudan, so that the country can begin a new chapter of economic reconstruction and prosperity. She also encouraged the Sudanese government and the armed movements, to urgently return to the negotiation table with a more conciliatory approach towards resolving their political differences in the interest of the people of Sudan. In this regard, Dlamini-Zuma called on all parties to cooperate fully with the efforts of the AU High Level Implementation Panel to reach a Cessation of Hostilities Agreement and a Permanent Ceasefire and participate in an inclusive political process, which would guarantee the Sudanese people the long awaited peace.
