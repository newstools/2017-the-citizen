Four for Parnell and Sri Lanka are bowled out twice in a day. They make 177 and lose by an innings and 118 runs. It&#8217;s a rare whitewash for South Africa! 16.00: AND ANOTHER! Duanne Olivier peppers Lahiru Kumara with short one but it doesn&#8217;t really get up. He ducks, it loops up and the catch is taken. It&#8217;s given not out but the review reveals glove. SL 177/9. 15.55: GONE! It was only a matter of time before the Islanders&#8217; lusty blows would lead to a chance. But oh boy, did the Proteas embrace a difficult chance! Upul Tharanga skies a pull and JP Duminy, running with his back to the ball grabs a fabulous catch at deep fine leg. SL 177/8. 15.34: 150 up for Sri Lanka as Suranga Lakmal plays some lusty blows. 15.25: OUT! Parnell bullies Herath with a short ball. He can&#8217;t cope and the ball loops to gully. SL 134/7. 14.57: Tea time at the Wanderers. Sri Lanka in the mire on 124/6, still 171 behind. 14.44: WICKETS! It&#8217;s all tumbling down for Sri Lanka. Dimuth Karunaratne, after a gritty 50, gets castled by the brilliant Rabada before Dinesh Chandimal edges to the slip cordon again off Philander. SL 118/6. 14.12: OUT! Captain Faf-tastic! Angelo Mathews tries to cut Olivier but gets a thick edge and the Proteas skipper plucks a magnificent one-handed catch from second slip. SL 87/4. 13.47: GONE! Duanne Olivier took a while to find his rhythm in the second innings but he seems to have settled now. Good line and length to Dhananjaya de Silva, who edges to the slip. SL 59/3. 13.31: 50 up for Sri Lanka as Dhananjaya de Silva whips Duanne Olivier to leg. SL 52/2. 13.15: OUT! Parnell&#8217;s bad luck didn&#8217;t last long. He keeps his angle tight to Kusal Mendis, who leaves one agonisingly. The next delivery is too close to cut and the bails are rattled. Good bowling. SL 39/2. 13.13: Dropped! Wayne Parnell replaces Philander and immediately induces the edge but Dean Elgar can&#8217;t hold on at third slip. SL 35/1. 12.52: Lunch done, and the Proteas are on the prowl once again. SL 18/1. 12.00: And that&#8217;s lunch. Sri Lanka on 13/1 in their second innings. 11.45: OUT! Well, that didn&#8217;t take long for Kagiso Rabada. His first ball is a snorter and Kaushal Silva simply fends it to a nonchalant Quinton de Kock, who just sticks out a hand. SL 2/1. 11.44: Vernon Philander bowls a steady first over of the follow-on. SL 2/0. 11.28: GONE! Wayne Parnell completes a good, diving grab off his own bowling. SL all out for 131. Will the follow-on be enforced? 11.20: OUT! Olivier gets a second. It&#8217;s goody. Subtle movement away from Upul Tharanga but the key is the length. Dean Elgar&#8217;s hands are safe at third slip. SL 126/9. 11.17: WICKET! Wayne Parnell among the wickets too. Suranga Lakmal&#8217;s drive is airborne and Rabada grabs a catch at short mid-off. SL 126/8. 10.59: GONE! That&#8217;s Duanne Olivier&#8217;s first Test wicket. A short ball hurries on to Rangana Herath, who sort of withdraws from a hook shot. Stephen Cook takes an easy catch at square leg. SL 108/7. 10.39: WOW! OUT! Rabada in on the act as he nabs the wicket of Mathews. What a magnificent catch from Quinton de Kock, diving pretty much in the place of first slip. Rabada&#8217;s joy is fantastic to watch. SL 100/6. 10.39: 100 up for the Sri Lankans. The celebrations are, understandably, non-existent. 10.33: Philander has Mathews trapped in front but his review reveals an edge. Reprieve for the visitors. SL 95/5. 10.11: GONE! Spoke too soon! Brilliant from Philander. It&#8217;s that typical spot outside off and Dinesh Chandimal has a nibble. SL 90/5. 10.10: Kagiso Rabada and Vernon Philander have started the day. Rabada induced an edge from Angelo Mathews. But the batting pair holds out. SL 90/4. 9.52: One of the big talking points to date is Temba Bavuma&#8217;s poor form currently. What are the selectors to do? Read more here. 9.50: It&#8217;s proverbial moving day in the third Test at the Wanderers. The Proteas are in a powerful position and could potentially enforce a follow-on if Sri Lanka don&#8217;t show more application. For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
