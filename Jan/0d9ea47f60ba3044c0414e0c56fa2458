The Kremlin on Monday branded a hacking report by US intelligence baseless and amateurish, saying Moscow is growing tired of denying claims the Russian government meddled in the US election. &#8220;These are baseless allegations substantiated with nothing, done on a rather amateurish, emotional level that is hardly worthy of professional work of truly world-class security services,&#8221; Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists. US intelligence agencies on Friday released a report saying that Russian President Vladimir Putin personally ordered a campaign of hacking and media manipulation to upend the campaign of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. The Kremlin&#8217;s comments were the first official reaction by Moscow to the public report, which was half the length of the classified version presented to President Barack Obama and President-elect Donald Trump. &#8220;We still don&#8217;t know what data is really being used by those who present such unfounded accusations,&#8221; Peskov said, insisting the Kremlin was &#8220;categorically denying any implication&#8221; it was responsible for the alleged hacking. &#8211; &#8216;Full-on witch hunt&#8217; &#8211; &#8220;We are growing rather tired of these accusations. It is becoming a full-on witch hunt,&#8221; Peskov said, echoing Trump&#8217;s claim ahead of Friday&#8217;s briefing by spy chiefs that the hacking revelations were a &#8220;political witch hunt&#8221; aimed at discrediting him. Peskov added that &#8220;witch hunts&#8221; by US politicians are usually followed by &#8220;more sober specialists, more sober approaches which seek dialogue rather than emotional fits.&#8221; The declassified US intel report contained largely open-source information to show that Russian state media followed a pro-Trump line and said there was &#8220;high confidence&#8221; in intelligence from multiple sources that Putin ordered the campaign to tilt the vote, without revealing those sources. In December, the White House said the GRU Russian military intelligence orchestrated a hack, helped by the Federal Security Service and various third parties, though without saying exactly how the alleged hack was perpetrated. Trump did not reject the report&#8217;s findings that Russia-ordered hacking occurred, but denied that it swayed the election outcome and blamed &#8220;gross negligence by the Democratic National Committee&#8221; for lax cyber security. His incoming chief of staff Reince Priebus told Fox News Sunday that &#8220;he&#8217;s not denying entities in Russia are behind these particular hackings.&#8221; President Barack Obama, who has received the same briefing, said Sunday that he underestimated the impact of Russian hacking and that &#8220;this is something that Putin has been doing for quite some time in Europe.&#8221; The hacking claims pushed ties between the US and Russia &#8212; already at their lowest since the Cold War due to Ukraine and Syria &#8212; to a new nadir. Obama in December expelled 35 suspected Russian spies and slapped sanctions on Moscow&#8217;s main intelligence agencies over the scandal. Putin refused to retaliate in kind to the measures as Moscow pins its hopes on Trump &#8212; who has publicly praised Putin &#8212; to improve ties. Peskov said the Kremlin has not been in touch with Trump&#8217;s team and for the moment is not making any plans for a face-to-face meeting &#8220;at least until President-elect becomes President&#8221; later this month. 1994-2017 Agence France-Presse
