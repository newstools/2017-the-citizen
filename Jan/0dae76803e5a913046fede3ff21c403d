In her own words, Bonang has shed some insight into the messy love triangle she found herself in when she decided to date AKA two years ago while he was still with the mother of his child, Zinhle. In an interview with Drum magazine, Bonang says: &#8220;Kiernan and I were friends, and we got squished into this unfortunate situation that I still look at and laugh about everyday because of all the inaccuracies.&#8221; I&#8217;m better, stronger, have made more money, am more successful, more famous and have more fans In what appears to be a jab at Zinhle, who exposed the pair on her blog by writing a post about how Bonang had had an affair with her boyfriend at the time and is said to have sent letters to the companies of Bonang&#8217;s endorsements calling for them to drop her, Bonang is boastful. &#8220;I&#8217;m better, stronger, have made more money, am more successful, more famous and have more fans than the people who put me in that situation.&#8221; But Bonang is adamant that she is yet to reveal the exact details of the saga which saw her trend on Twitter for days, called names and have people like Pearl Thusi call her out for her devastating role in Zinhle and AKA&#8217;s break-up. &#8220;And still people don&#8217;t know my side of the story. One day the truth about what happened with me and Kiernan will be revealed.&#8221; AKA and Bonang seem to have shrugged off the public scrutiny their relationship has brought, with the pair winning a You Spectacular Award for best couple in 2016.
