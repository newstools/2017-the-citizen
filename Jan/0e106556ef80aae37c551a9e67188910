The White House meeting between US President Donald Trump and British Prime Minister Theresa May reveals an underlying meeting of minds between the two world leaders. It is self-evident that the prime consideration for any political leader is the overall welfare of the nation the entire nation, those who have their unqualified mandate, as well as those who do not. It is equally clear that two of the most important aspects of this guardianship are national safety and economic strength. On the first criterion, May s obligation to implement Brexit and Trump s campaign promise of erecting fences of exclusion by mimicking the disastrous social consequences of the Berlin Wall by the forcible prescription of Mexican illegals and his avowed intention to veto Muslim immigrants, are not that far apart. Both lines of thought were carried to fruition on a wave of largely understated xenophobia within the two separate electorates in Britain a flood of opendoor admissions from European Union citizens seeking British benefits and in America by the threat of job shrinkage in an often uncompetitive US industry, fuelled by cheaper foreign goods. But it is also certain that the second factor concern for the dual economies will become the crucial pivot. For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
