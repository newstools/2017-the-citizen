The Gupta family&#8217;s Oakbay Investments has described Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan as a &#8220;weak-kneed politician&#8221; and his court application against them as bizarre, superfluous and riddled with factual and legal errors. Gordhan&#8217;s application for a court order declaring that he cannot interfere with the decision of South Africa&#8217;s four major banks not to do business with the Guptas will be heard before a full bench of the High Court in Pretoria towards the end of March. Oakbay on Friday filed opposing papers seeking the dismissal of the application and accusing the minister of being involved in a coordinated political campaign to &#8220;clip the wings of the Gupta family&#8221;. &#8220;The timing of the minister&#8217;s application supports the Oakbay Group&#8217;s suspicions that the application is politically motivated and is part of the minister&#8217;s ongoing plan to diminish the Oakbay Group and the Gupta family and to damage their hard-earned South African business,&#8221; the group said in a statement. Gordhan in his affidavit revealed how R6.8 billion in &#8220;suspicious and unusual transactions&#8221; may have contributed to a decision by the banks to close accounts associated with the Gupta family.

Oakbay said in a statement the minister&#8217;s application was riddled with factual and legal errors and the minister&#8217;s reliance on a list of 72 purported &#8220;suspicious transaction reports&#8221; was misplaced and the minister&#8217;s application supported by flawed analysis and a faulty factual record. &#8220;Oakbay has never suggested that the minister is required to intervene in the bank-customer relationship. There is no contested legal issue here, and there was never any reason for the minister to bring this application,&#8221; the group said. According to Oakbay, the minister could simply have declined to do anything about the request for assistance but instead asked the court to confirm that he did not have to do anything. &#8220;The minister has essentially asked the court to insert itself into the functioning of the executive branch. It would be bizarre if every empowered government official receiving a request for assistance races to the court to seek a declaration that he/she does not have to act on the request. &#8220;If the court were to countenance the application for guidance, it would open the floodgates for other weak-kneed political officials who are too scared to take positions on sensitive political and policy matters and would make the judiciary a maker of political judgments. &#8220;This application is an abuse of court and an effort to involve the independent judiciary to settle political scores,&#8221; Oakbay said. The group said it had appointed an international investigative firm to look into the alleged suspicious transactions, and they concluded that there was not enough information about the transaction reports to identify them in the books and records of the Oakbay Group or the personal bank accounts of the Gupta family. &#8220;Two-thirds of the alleged suspicious transactions occurred after the time when the banks had already decided to terminate the relationship with Oakbay,&#8221; the affidavit stated. &#8211; African News Agency (ANA) For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
