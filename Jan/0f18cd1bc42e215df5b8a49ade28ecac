Defending champion Legal Eagle has sights firmly set on claiming another L Ormarins Queen s Plate crown with the reigning Horse of the Year headlining an 11 horse field for the 2017 renewal at Kenilworth Racecourse on 7 January. The 1600m contest will have an increased stake of R1.5-million for this year s event has drawn a Triple Crown winner, a Vodacom Durban July winner, several Grade One winners and a couple of pretenders to the throne. Legal Eagle, to be ridden by regular jockey Anton Marcus, is one of two confirmed Sean Tarry inmates taking their chances in South Africa s oldest race with French Navy the mount of Weichong Marwing. Abashiri will be piloted by Gavin Lerena while Piere Strydom reunites with The Conglomerate in the hopes of repeating their heroics at Greyville when springing a surprise in the July. Captain America, in the care of Brett Crawford, has his regular jockey Corne Orffer in the irons as does Marinaresco with Grant van Niekerk up. Van Niekerk and his mount will be hoping to turn the tables after being beaten in the Green Point Stakes (Gr 2) by Legal Eagle earlier this month. This showdown has been one of the talking points of the Summer of Champions and opinions will no doubt once again be split. Other runners confirmed in the field for the Grade One contest include Sail South, Silicone Valley and Midnite Zone, one of three entries from the Crawford yard. Fifty Cents was supplemented into the race by the Justin Snaith stable after listed success earlier in December and will be ridden by the in-form Greg Cheyne while bottom weight Bold Rex rounds off the 11-runner affair. The main event is supplemented by the running of the Maine Chance Farms Paddock Stakes (Gr 1) where a cracking field of fillies and mares look to enhance their value in the breeding shed. A total of 12 horses will line for the R1-million contest and with the likes of Bela-Bela and Silver Mountain, one of three entries from the Candice Bass-Robinson stable, among a number of classy sorts for the weight-for-age affair. Taking place over two days the L Ormarins Queen s Plate Festival will once again be one of the must-attend social events of the South African summer and tickets for the blue and white themed affair on 6 &amp; 7 January are available here http://bit.ly/LQP2017. The opening day is highlighted by the running of the Cartier Sceptre Stakes (Gr 2) as well as the Garden Party with prizes offered for the best-dressed on course.
