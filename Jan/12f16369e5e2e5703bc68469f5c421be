The Democratic Alliance has accused suspended police commissioner Riah Phiyega of trying to bide time to avoid action taken against her over the Marikana massacre. DA MP on the police portfolio committee, Zak Mbhele said on Monday that Phiyega s appeal to have the Claassen report overturned was evidence of a lack of accountability. It is unfortunate that suspended Police Commissioner Phiyega&#8217;s stalling tactics may cause further delays in ensuring accountability for her culpability in the decline of the police service and the weakening of the fight against the crime, Mbhele told The Citizen.
