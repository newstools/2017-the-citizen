Costa, Chelsea&#8217;s top scorer with 14 league goals, is thought to have been dropped after a training-ground row with fitness coach Julio Tous. There are also reports he is the subject of an eye-watering offer from an unnamed Chinese club, but Conte said he had only been absent at the King Power Stadium because of a back injury. &#8220;I repeat the truth because I like to tell the truth and not lie,&#8221; Conte told BT Sport. &#8220;Diego stopped training on Tuesday because he felt a pain in his back and from that moment he didn&#8217;t train during the week. For this reason, he wasn&#8217;t available today. This is the truth.&#8221; Costa, 28, is reported to have received a contract offer from China worth 30 million ($36.5 million, 34 million euros) a year. But Conte said: &#8220;I don&#8217;t know anything about this.&#8221; Asked if he would need to speak to Costa and owner Roman Abramovich to resolve the situation, Conte replied: &#8220;If there are problems, I prefer to solve the problem in the changing room and not during the press conference. &#8220;If, and I repeat if, there are problems.&#8221; Chelsea host Hull City in their next league game and Conte said it was too early to say whether or not Costa would take part. &#8220;It&#8217;s very difficult to tell this now,&#8221; said the Italian. In Costa&#8217;s absence, Conte aligned Eden Hazard as a central striker, flanked by Willian and Pedro Rodriguez. Wing-back Marcos Alonso scored twice and Pedro also found the net as Chelsea bounced back from their 2-0 defeat at Tottenham Hotspur to go seven points clear at the summit. &#8220;You guys made up the story,&#8221; Alonso told the BBC when asked about Costa. &#8220;Diego wasn&#8217;t feeling well because of his back. He&#8217;s very happy and will have a great enough season at Chelsea.&#8221;
