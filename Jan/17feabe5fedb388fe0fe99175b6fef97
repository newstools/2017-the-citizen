by Tom WILLIAMS United cruised into the FA Cup fourth round on Saturday after registering an eighth consecutive win by crushing second-tier Reading 4-0 at Old Trafford. They face a showdown with fellow League Cup semi-finalists Liverpool in the league at the weekend, but with a day out at Wembley only 180 minutes away, Mourinho does not want to take any chances. &#8220;We play against Liverpool, a big match for us, but we want to be in the final,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So we are going to face this Hull match with everything we have, all the power we have, as we know it&#8217;s two legs, but the second leg is away. &#8220;If we can do something in the first leg that gives us the advantage, we will try to do that.&#8221; Mourinho made a number of changes for the visit of former United defender Jaap Stam&#8217;s Reading and has revealed he will restore several first-team regulars for the visit of Hull. &#8220;I play with the players that didn&#8217;t play (against Reading),&#8221; said Mourinho, who won three League Cups over his two spells as Chelsea manager. &#8220;I played with fresh players and I don&#8217;t want to say anything about first-choice or second-choice, but we played with fresh players, the players who didn&#8217;t play against West Ham. &#8220;In the next match against Hull City we are going to play again with fresh players. So it&#8217;s easy to know our team &#8212; Zlatan (Ibrahimovic), (Paul) Pogba, (Ander) Herrera, (Antonio) Valencia.&#8221; Wayne Rooney equalled Bobby Charlton&#8217;s United scoring record by netting his 249th goal for the club against Reading, but he is likely to drop to the bench against Hull. Centre-back Marcos Rojo is a doubt after being withdrawn against Reading with a muscular problem. With Eric Bailly having departed for the Africa Cup of Nations with Ivory Coast, it could leave Phil Jones and Chris Smalling as United&#8217;s only fit senior centre-backs. &#8211; Fonte focus &#8211; Marco Silva made a winning start to life as Hull head coach with a 2-0 victory over Swansea City in the FA Cup on Saturday and he will relish the prospect of tackling fellow Portuguese Mourinho. &#8220;It is a fantastic moment for the club that we play Manchester United in a semi-final,&#8221; Silva said. The carrot of a potential final appearance against arch rivals United is sure to motivate Liverpool when they travel to Southampton on Wednesday for the first leg of their semi-final. Having fielded Liverpool&#8217;s youngest ever team in their 0-0 FA Cup draw at home to fourth-tier Plymouth Argyle on Sunday, manager Jurgen Klopp is also expected to revert to a full-strength team. &#8220;That&#8217;s only in a few days,&#8221; said Klopp, whose side lost on penalties to Manchester City in last season&#8217;s final. &#8220;I have no idea (about fielding a more experienced line-up), but probably, yes. It&#8217;s pretty likely.&#8221; Southampton are seeking to reach a first major final since their 1-0 loss to Arsenal in the deciding match of the FA Cup in 2003. Claude Puel&#8217;s side came within a whisker of reaching the FA Cup fourth round on Saturday, only for Steven Naismith&#8217;s 92nd-minute header to earn Norwich City a 2-2 draw and take the tie to a replay. Portuguese centre-back Jose Fonte, who has reportedly asked to leave the club, did not feature against Norwich and Puel refused to be drawn as to whether he would play against Liverpool. &#8220;You can understand I cannot give an answer about this,&#8221; said the Southampton manager. &#8220;It is between Jose and the club and we will see in the future.&#8221; Fixtures Tuesday (2000 GMT): Manchester United v Hull City Wednesday (1945 GMT): Southampton v Liverpool
