How South African cricket will wish January would just end. Dane Vilas on Friday became yet another prominent local player to ditch international cricket in favour of a Kolpak contract with English county Lancashire.

Kyle Abbott and Rilee Rossouw stole much of the sporting headlines earlier this month in joining Hampshire. Vilas, a 31-year-old Cape Cobras stalwart, made his Test debut in Bangladesh in 2015 but despite keeping tidily, he&#8217;s batting looked suspect at the highest level. He&#8217;ll end his six-Test career with an average of 10.44, having only scored 94 runs in nine innings. With the irrepressible Quinton de Kock continuing to take international cricket by storm, Vilas&#8217; opportunities at the highest level looks increasingly remote. &#8220;Signing a player of Dane s undoubted calibre and experience is a great boost as we continue our preparations ahead of the new season,&#8221; said Glenn Chapple, Lancashire&#8217;s head coach. &#8220;He has an excellent record in First Class cricket and is a very good wicket keeper. Dane s aggressive batting style will see him as an important part of our T20 and one-day sides in 2017, as well as four day cricket.&#8221; Chapple isn&#8217;t overstating Vilas&#8217; potential value.

In limited overs formats, he scores his runs at a run-a-ball. &#8220;Lancashire is one of the biggest Clubs in England and I&#8217;m really excited about this opportunity to play my cricket here,&#8221; said Vilas. &#8220;I&#8217;m relishing the opportunity of playing county cricket this summer. It&#8217;s going to be a huge challenge personally and I&#8217;m already looking forward to linking up with the squad ahead of the start to the season.&#8221; Lancashire has a tradition of signing South African players and recently still had former Test batters Ashwell Prince and Alviro Petersen on their books.
