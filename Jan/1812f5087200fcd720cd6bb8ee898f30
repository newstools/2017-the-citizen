Hashim Amla&#8217;s 100th Test won&#8217;t be his last. His Proteas captain, Faf du Plessis, was decisive in quelling any rumours in that regard after the 33-year-old veteran this week decided not to take part in any media activities before Thursday&#8217;s third Test at the Wanderers.

He&#8217;s not even thinking about it.&#8221; Instead, Du Plessis believes Amla&#8217;s reluctance to participate in the hype surrounding his big day is merely down to his own humble nature. &#8220;It&#8217;s just another game for him,&#8221; he said. &#8220;He doesn&#8217;t want any of the attention to be focused on him. He just wants to rock up and play another game of cricket. I&#8217;d like to make the game extra special for him, but that&#8217;s simply not who he is.&#8221; Intriguingly, the South African skipper predicts the bearded talisman will be the eighth and last local players to reach the milestone of a century of Tests. &#8220;I&#8217;m going out on a limb here but I don&#8217;t think any other South African player in future will join Hashim and the rest,&#8221; said Du Plessis. &#8220;Quinton de Kock and Kagiso Rabada are maybe two players who still might play 100 Tests but I&#8217;m not too sure about that.&#8221; He cites the changing structural nature of the sport as one of the main reasons for the new generation of international cricketers not playing as many Tests as previously.

It&#8217;s not the same as before,&#8221; said Du Plessis. &#8220;Guys like Jacques Kallis, Graeme Smith and AB de Villiers got to their 100 Tests because there was a lot of five-day cricket played during that period. &#8220;Now we&#8217;re seeing more and more T20 cricket being played and most players want a slice of the action.&#8221; As a result, international careers are being shortened. &#8220;Your shelf life as a top-class cricketer isn&#8217;t what it used to be. There&#8217;s simply too much cricket being played and it&#8217;s taking a toll on bodies,&#8221; said Du Plessis. &#8220;I hope I&#8217;m proved wrong but that&#8217;s the way it&#8217;s certainly going. &#8220;That&#8217;s why Hashim&#8217;s achievement needs to be celebrated. It&#8217;s a massive one.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
