For a little more than 16 years, Patricia de Lille has been one of the cornerstones of the DA and, many would have it, the glue which has kept the official opposition in control of the Western Cape. But the 65-year-old De Lille s resignation from the DA s provincial leadership to concentrate on her position as mayor of Cape Town an office she assumed in 2011 has opened the floor to speculations for the real reasons behind her decision. The ANC, which lost the Western Cape to the DA in the 2009 general elections, was quick to seize any political edge offered, calling De Lille s backing out of the provincial government firing line a tipping point .

And both have very firm ideas on the country s future. Neither, it must be added, has hesitated to shoot from the hip, saying what was on her mind without equivocation. Any rift has been widely debunked from several quarters, but the rumbles continue to echo like distant thunder. Whatever the reasons for De Lille s withdrawal and there is no reason to doubt her version the country will be poorer without her input.
