South African captains of industry and companies who have been included in Top 500: South Africa s Best Managed Companies listing will step off the pages and on to the stage at the listing s inaugural awards ceremony in Johannesburg this year. The Top 500 publication profiles the top five companies in 100 business sectors every year. This year it is adding a black-tie awards ceremony. Topco Media, which runs the listing, said in a statement issued on Tuesday that the companies listed comprise the vanguard of corporate South Africa and represent an annual combined turnover in excess of R3.5 trillion. The Top 500 publication sits in the top drawer of local and international CEOs desks and is frequently referenced to inform their business decisions, investments and partnerships worth billions, in both the private and public sector, Topco said. The performance during 2016 of more than 2 000 companies was evaluated, according to methodology designed by Topco and the University of Cape Town s Development Policy Research Unit, to create the most recent listing, which was published ahead of the new year. The company said the new Top 500 Awards would distil the latest publication s 100 sectors into 14 broader categories and introduce three standalone awards, the chief executive of the year, a lifetime achievement award and the Best Managed Company of the Year award. This new annual black-tie event will see an elite inner circle of companies named as the best of the top, admirals at the helm of the economy. The hundreds of distinguished individuals in attendance to salute their success will include a host of governmental leaders, CEOs and magnates, celebrities and industry analysts, the statement concluded.
