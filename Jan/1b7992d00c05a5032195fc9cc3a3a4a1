Peter de Villiers, the motormouth former Springbok coach, is at it again with his controversial statements. The 59-year-old, who has held low-profile gigs since his contract with the national side wasn&#8217;t renewed in 2011, alleges the South African Rugby Union (Saru) is sabotaging his future employment.

De Villiers has twice, in 2015 and 2016, been linked with the Cavaliers&#8217; head coach position, only to lose out to other, relatively obscure candidates. &#8220;They will never allow me to go to any rugby union in South Africa. What I heard very early last year is that people from SARU paid Boland actually, or offered them money not to even consider me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I heard it from a very good source.&#8221; In 2009, De Villiers led the Boks to a series win over the British &amp; Irish Lions as well as the Tri-Nations title. Yet various critics believe those achievements weren&#8217;t down to his coaching ability but rather the experienced group of players he could work with. Nonetheless, he believes the local rugby fraternity simply don&#8217;t understand his methods. I don t know what I have done wrong. I think I am too strong,&#8221; said De Villiers. &#8220;My way of thinking, my way of doing things is too different. Maybe there s something wrong with my ears because I don t listen to things I know won t work. &#8220;And the rugby people don t like it.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
