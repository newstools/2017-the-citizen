Temba Bavuma&#8217;s poor form in the Test series against Sri Lanka is not only a problem for himself but also the Proteas. When the diminutive right-hander fished rashly outside off-stump during yesterday&#8217;s second day of the third Test at the Wanderers, his average in his last seven innings plummeted to 7.14. Even worse, on a day where South Africa&#8217;s batters collapsed from 338/3 to 426 all out due to good Sri Lankan bowling, his dismissal was purely down to poor judgement.

But in South African cricket&#8217;s brave new world of dedicated transformation, it&#8217;s not that simple. Cricket South Africa have resolved that the Proteas need to pick a minimum average of 18 black players over the course of a season. It means South Africa can get away with picking one black player &#8211; let&#8217;s assume Kagiso Rabada &#8211; in one, maybe two Tests. They can&#8217;t do it for a long period of time. It&#8217;s not exactly as if franchise cricket is teeming with suitable black batsman to replace Bavuma, should the selectors want a direct replacement. Instead, it would seem the balance of the side would need to change through the selection, for example, of someone like the exciting all-rounder Andile Phehlukwayo. That is not a desirable state of affairs. Rather, Bavuma should heed the advice of JP Duminy. The left-hander has also been under pressure to cement his place since taking over De Villiers&#8217; role at No 4. &#8220;It would be silly of me not to say AB&#8217;s return has been at the back of my mind,&#8221; Duminy said yesterday. &#8220;Of course I&#8217;ve been wondering where he would fit in when he came back and is my spot up for grabs. &#8220;But in the end, it&#8217;s about opportunity. Whenever they are presented, you have to take them.&#8221; Duminy certainly did that, striking a sumptuous 155 on the first day. Whether it&#8217;s possible for Bavuma to do the same in this match is doubtful. Rabada (2/26) and Vernon Philander (2/23) were dominant again in reducing Sri Lanka to 80/4 when bad light stopped play. Yet the Proteas&#8217; limited overs commitments over the next few weeks could allow Bavuma to regain his touch at the Highveld Lions. He&#8217;ll also be comforted by the knowledge that he has his national teammates&#8217; backing. &#8220;Temba just needs to be himself, believe in what he does,&#8221; said Duminy. &#8220;He&#8217;s an excellent player and we know a big score is around the corner.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
