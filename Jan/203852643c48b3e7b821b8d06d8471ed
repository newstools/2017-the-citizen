Concerns about the weather at the ANC&#8217;s 105th birthday bash led EFF national chairperson advocate Dali Mpofu to joke late on Saturday on Twitter that &#8220;There&#8217;s apparently NO truth in the rumour of ANC members seen in Orlando trying to stop the rain by spraying large amounts of DOOM skywards!&#8221; Theres apparently NO truth in the rumour of ANC members seen in Orlando trying to stop the rain by spraying large amounts of DOOM skywards! &mdash; Dali Mpofu (@AdvDali_Mpofu) January 7, 2017 Last year a pastor made headlines by spraying Doom on his congregants, saying that faith in the powers of the insecticide would be able to heal all manner of ills. Thunderstorms were forecast for Soweto on Sunday. The ANC and its supporters from throughout the country have descended on Orlando Stadium in Soweto to celebrate the former liberation party s 105th birthday. On Friday, forecaster Wayne Venter said that in Gauteng, heavy rain was likely to continue on Sunday. The rainfall is expected to continue into Sunday as well and we have already issued a watch for heavy rain which could lead to localised flooding, he said. Whether they&#8217;ve been spraying Doom or even praying about the weather or not, it appears that the heavy rain eased up in the morning, though the stadium was very wet and the skies still looked dark ahead of President Jaob Zuma&#8217;s address scheduled for 11am.
