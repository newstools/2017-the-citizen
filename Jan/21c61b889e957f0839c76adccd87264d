One person died and four others, including a child, were injured, some seriously, when a light delivery vehicle overturned on the N3 in Howick, KwaZulu-Natal paramedics said on Saturday. Netcare 911 paramedics worked alongside other services on the scene on Saturday afternoon, Netcare 911 spokeswoman Athlenda Mathe said. One person was declared dead on the scene while the rest of the injured were stabilised and thereafter transported to a nearby hospital for further medical care. Two lanes on the righthand, northbound, had been closed to traffic, Mathe said.
