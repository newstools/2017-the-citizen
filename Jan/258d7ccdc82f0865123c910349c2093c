Members of the Limpopo Endangered Species Unit, with the help of the Makhado police, arrested three suspects for the illegal possession of rhino horn after a chase along the Vivo Road outside Louis Trichardt in Limpopo province on Friday at around 2pm, reports the Bosveld Review. The members, travelling in two vehicles, were following up on information received on suspects attempting to sell rhino horn in the Louis Trichardt area when they spotted the suspects vehicle and followed them. The suspects realised they were being followed and threw a wrapped object from the vehicle and sped off. One police vehicle stopped and retrieved the object while the other vehicle followed the suspects and made the arrest, said Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo. Three suspects two South African brothers in their fifties and a Zimbabwean national aged-41-years-old were arrested by the Makhado Cluster First Responder Team and the POP members. A vehicle belonging to one of the brothers was also confiscated. Members of the Endangered Species Unit who retrieved the object found it to be one rhino horn. It is suspected that the horn might be connected to an incident of poaching in the Witpoort area that occurred earlier in the week where a rhino and her calf were shot and dehorned. Forensic tests will still be conducted to confirm this, he added. Investigations continue to determine the suspects possible involvement in other similar incidents of rhino poaching, said Mojapelo. The suspects are due to appear in the Makhado Magistrates Court on Monday on a the charges of illegal possession of a rhino horn and the illegal hunting of endangered species.
