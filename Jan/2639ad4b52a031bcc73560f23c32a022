She then attempted to fight the man off who then called two other suspects to collect her from the flat.

The men left her for dead in the bushes, however the woman managed to find her way back to Victoria Drive and was assisted by members of the public. Police spokesperson, Colonel Priscilla Naidu, said the case against the 33-year-old man was postponed to Friday.
