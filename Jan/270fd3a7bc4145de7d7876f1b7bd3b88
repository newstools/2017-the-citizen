By nature, former Proteas coach Corrie van Zyl is a becalmed man. Yet when he&#8217;s asked to chat about Hashim Amla &#8211; who on Thursday will become the eighth South African to play 100 Tests &#8211; there&#8217;s a distinct tone of excitement.

His current indifferent form is normal for any player. It shouldn&#8217;t detract from his work ethic.&#8221; When Van Zyl was tasked with guiding the Proteas in 2010 following the sudden resignation of Mickey Arthur, he didn&#8217;t inherit the complete batsman the team now possesses. &#8220;Hashim was a stalwart of the Test side but at that stage we had only starting using him as an opener in one-day cricket,&#8221; said Van Zyl. &#8220;I&#8217;d like to think it was my coaching staff that developed him into such a brilliant opener against the white ball. &#8220;But it was also down to him. Hashim made the conscious effort to become a more versatile player, I still find it astounding that he can score close to a run-a-ball without truly changing his approach to batting.&#8221; Gary Kirsten, one of the Proteas to have played a century of Tests and the mentor who guided the national side to the top of the Test rankings, raves about the &#8220;privilege&#8221; of coaching Amla. &#8220;I&#8217;m not actually sure if I really coached him,&#8221; chuckled Kirsten. &#8220;When I took over the side, he was a rounded cricketer. Hashim was crucial to our plans.&#8221; Kirsten is particularly impressed with the way Amla managed to balance the demands of the game and life.

That man breathes cricket,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But even though he&#8217;s constantly talking cricket, he never felt overbearing. In fact, Hashim never allows the sport to dominate his life.&#8221; Kirsten also believes the excitement of Amla&#8217;s milestone will be highlight of his life. &#8220;I experienced it myself. When he walks out to bat, the memory will be etched forever. Hashim deserves it for being such a hard-working player.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
