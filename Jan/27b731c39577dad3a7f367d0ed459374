It is no secret that Papa Penny Ahee is one of the most talked about shows on TV right now. While some, such as Date My Family&#8216;s Mdu, made headlines for apparently being fake, Xitsonga musician Penny Penny is famous for his authenticity, which most find entertaining. In one memorable episode, Penny Penny went to Giyani in the morning and came back later in the afternoon, only to find that his wife had not cooked. He was just not impressed. The musician could not understand why his wife did not cook for him. When she told him she thought he would have lunch in Giyani, he simply told her: &#8220;My wife is not in Giyani.&#8221; The poor woman could see her husband was unhappy, so she prepared sandwiches thinking they would sort him out. She was wrong. He complained further and told her the bread and polony were just not enough. The conclusion? He said he would wait for a cooked meal because he just enjoyed his wife&#8217;s cooking.
