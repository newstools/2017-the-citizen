Eskom on Wednesday postponed to mid-January scheduled interruption of bulk electricity supply to defaulting municipalities in the Free State and North West provinces. The move came after AfriForum and AfriBusiness applied for an urgent interdict at the North Gauteng High Court on Wednesday to stop Eskom from cutting electricity to municipalities that had outstanding bills. The organisations argued that this move was unconstitutional as it would affect ordinary citizens and that there were other ways to recover the money. Eskom had threatened to cut power supplies on Thursday to municipalities that failed to settle the arrears by then. The seven affected municipalities in the Free State include Tokologo, Nketoana, Nala, Mantsopa, Masilonyana, Dihlabeng, and Moqhaka municipalities. Three other municipalities in the North West Naledi, Mamusa, and Ventersdorp are also in arrears After careful consideration of the impact of the public holidays over the festive period, and the commitment made in court today during the AfriForum case, Eskom has decided to postpone the interruption of supply to these municipalities from 5 January 2017 to 16 January 2017, Eskom said in a statement. This will allow all impacted stakeholders more time to prepare accordingly. Eskom said it hoped that the affected municipalities would use this opportunity to make payment arrangements. Last year, Eskom nearly cut the bulk electricity supply to 20 worst defaulting municipalities in a bid to recover R3.68 billion owed to it.
