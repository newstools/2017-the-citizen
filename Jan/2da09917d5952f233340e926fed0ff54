Over the festive season, the department of health and politicians took to social media to encourage people to practise safe sex and use protection. In a bid to encourage young people to use contraceptives, Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi even introduced the new multiflavoured condoms, Max, available in strawberry, banana and grape. This after South Africans apparently complained that the State&#8217;s Choice condoms did not smell nice and made a noise while being used. Even comedian Trevor Noah made fun of the &#8220;noisy&#8221; condoms, saying they sounded like vuvuzelas. Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa even promoted the new condoms in parliament, saying they made no noise during sex and gave maximum protection, further encouraging South Africans to use them.
