According to the world&#8217;s largest porn website, PornHub, South Africa is now in the top-20 porn-watching countries for the first time. It apparently also means this is the first time that South Africa is number one in Africa for watching porn. The top search is for the term &#8220;Ebony&#8221;. This points to how greater online access, particularly for black people, has been the main reason for the increase in porn traffic to the country. Lesbian porn remains the most searched-for category worldwide due to men being interested in women having sex with women and an increase in bisexual interest from women themselves. It&#8217;s also a popular category in South Africa, along with &#8220;Step Mom&#8221; porn and &#8220;Milf&#8221;. More than 90 billion video views were generated on PornHub, with SA doing its bit. That s a lot of viewing. According to PornHub, most people look at porn between 10pm and 1am, with 61% of access coming from smartphones.
