No sign has been found of a Cape Town man who went missing while swimming in the sea at Strandfontein beach, Cape Town, the National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) said on Sunday. NSRI Strandfontein duty crew were activated to assist the police dive unit at Strandfontein Pavilion at about 8.30am, NSRI Strandfontein station commander Vaughn Seconds said. A 22-year-old man from Crossroads in Cape Town reportedly went missing in the surf at about 5.20am after apparently going for a swim, he said. On our arrival on the scene law enforcement and the police dive unit were in attendance but no sign of the missing man had been found, and with the time that the man had reportedly gone missing, a police dive unit will continue with an ongoing search operation and police have opened an investigation, Seconds said.
