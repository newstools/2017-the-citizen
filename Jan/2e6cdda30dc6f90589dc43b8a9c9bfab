The murder case against Mark Warona Zinde was postponed in the Brits Regional Court on Tuesday. Prosecutor Hanna Conradie told the court that Zinde only arrived at the magistrates&#8217; court after lunch as the investigating officer had to go and fetch him in Vereeniging. The case was rolled over to Wednesday, and Zinde would be kept in custody in Brits. Zinde, 23, is accused of murdering his 50-year-old mother Hope Zinde, former SABC board member, journalist and television news anchor. The State alleges he killed his mother at their home in Pecanwood Estate, Hartbeespoort Dam near Brits in June last year. He is facing a charge of murder and possession of drug. He is also facing another charge of assault with the intention to cause grievous bodily harm at the Vereeniging Magistrate s Court. He was arrested in November last year, for allegedly attacking his father Dr Lebohang Manoto, at his Walkerville home, south of Johannesburg. Manoto, who took him in after he was released on R10,000 bail, laid charges of assault against his son at De Deur police station. His bail was revoked on December 19, following his arrest and not being binding by his bail conditions. Dressed in a black track pants and a blue T-shirt, Zinde walked slowly into the courtroom and briefly looked at his grandmother and uncle in court.
