The Gunners, who thrashed top-flight rivals Southampton 5-0 in the fourth round of the FA Cup on Saturday, are second in the Premier League. A sign of their strength in depth was that veteran French manager Wenger, in charge of Arsenal since September 1996, was able to make several changes to his starting line-up against the Saints. Theo Walcott scored a hat-trick against his former club, with Danny Welbeck adding the Gunners&#8217; other two goals as Wenger rested the likes of Petr Cech, Laurent Koscielny, Mesut Ozil and Alexis Sanchez. Those four players are all set to return for Tuesday&#8217;s league match against Watford, where Arsenal will look to close an eight-point gap to leaders Chelsea. Wenger, who will be serving the second of a four-match touchline ban against the Hornets at the Emirates, told Arsenal fans not to expect any new arrivals between now and Tuesday&#8217;s 2300 GMT transfer deadline. &#8220;It&#8217;s not only to buy players, you have to have a need in your squad first of all,&#8221; said Wenger. &#8220;I believe that number-wise and quality-wise, we have what is required to do well. &#8220;Now it&#8217;s down to us to perform and to produce with the quality of our focus, the quality of our ambition and desire to produce the performance in every single game.&#8221; The only player Arsenal have brought in during the transfer window is 20-year-old defender Cohen Bramall, who joined from non-league Hednesford Town for 40,000 (46,000 euros, $48,500). And Wenger forecast there would be few moves elsewhere before the transfer window shut. &#8220;(It will be) very quiet. On our front, we have a big squad,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We are not in need of buying. &#8220;On a general front it has been very quiet. That shows that there are not many players available who can strengthen English teams. &#8220;It also shows that all the teams in England, especially the big teams, have big squads. That&#8217;s why not a lot happened.&#8221; Real Madrid forward Karim Benzema has been linked with a move to north London side Arsenal but only &#8220;because he is French,&#8221; said Wenger. &#8220;And maybe there are some noises that he would leave Madrid, but as I just told you, there is no need for us to buy any strikers,&#8221; he added. &#8220;In the summer window? That&#8217;s not my worry at the moment. My worry is the next game against Watford.&#8221;
