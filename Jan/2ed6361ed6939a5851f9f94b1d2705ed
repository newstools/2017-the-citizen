The all white party is one of the most anticipated events of the year. Hosted by Da Les at his Bryanston mansion, the exclusive party has a guest list of 300 people who have been handpicked by the rapper and his squad. The do has been hyped up for at least a month, with Da Les posting a video urging people to &#8216;save the date&#8217;. On his social media profiles, he has been stunting on the public, sharing images of people who have attended the party such as Bonang, AKA, Boity and many other celebrities. ALSO READ: Bonang still laughs at unfortunate situation between her, AKA, DJ Zinhle Up until a few hours ago, the party was still on, with Da Les tweeting his excitement. People had also begun arriving but were shocked to be stopped by police officers at the gate. Da Les had seemingly forgotten to follow the rules and did not apply for a permit to host the party, leading to the police shutting it down. As sad as that may be for enthusiastic party goers, Twitter was lit with responses! @2freshLES RT yani singekho invited.
