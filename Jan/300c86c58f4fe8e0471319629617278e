The Independent Communications Authority (Icasa) of South Africa on Tuesday confirmed that the criminal case laid against the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) in connection with its failure to adhere to an order to reverse their decision to ban the airing of violent footage has been referred to the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (Hawks). Icasa councillor Nomvuyiso Batyi was briefing Parliament s communications portfolio. Batyi said the criminal charges were laid at the Bramley police station before being transferred to Brixton. She said they were informed around two weeks ago that the Hawks had now taken over the investigation. In May last year, then chief operating officer Hlaudi Motsoeng annnounced that the SABC would no longer show footage of violent service delivery protests. The announcement drew an outcry from various quarters and led to complaints being lodged with Icasa, who in July last year ruled the SABC must withdraw its decision. A few hours after the Icasa announcement, Motsoeneng said the decision would not be withdrawn, as Icasa was not a court of law .
