A Tshwane metro traffic officer is expected to go on trial in Cullinan on Wednesday on charges of corruption. Road Traffic Management Corporation spokesperson Simon Zwane said: Sebo Esther Mathabatha was arrested on Moloto Road in December 2015 while conducting law-enforcement operations. It is alleged that the she stopped an agent of the National Traffic Anti-Corruption Unit and demanded a R100 bribe. Mathabatha is currently out on bail. In a separate case of corruption, a warrant of arrest has been issued against a Mooi River licensing official after he failed to appear in court in connection with the alleged fraudulent issuing of licences. Zwane said Skhumbuzo Samson Ndlovu was supposed to appear at the Durban Commercial Crime Court on Monday, together with a driving school instructor from Estcourt. It is alleged that Ndlovu conspired with the driving school instructor to have licences fraudulently issued to drivers, said Zwane. The case has been postponed to March 30.
