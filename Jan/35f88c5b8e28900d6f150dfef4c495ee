The group Eblockwatch claims to have tracked down the Cradock woman who was part of a social media storm on Thursday morning after a picture emerged of her on the back of a bakkie in a cage.
The woman in the video is wearing what looks like the same headscarf that was worn by the woman in the cage.
The picture that went viral.
It has since been revealed that she was being driven by a 41-year-old farmer, Johan Erasmus, who explained that, in his view, he had done nothing wrong, and had instead been doing the woman a favour by giving her a lift to town.
He said the cage just happened to be on the back of the bakkie and is normally used for transporting sheep. He said he hadn’t put her in the cage, and she had instead chosen to get into it despite the fact that there was an open seat in the cabin of the bakkie.
Eblockwatch tracked down the woman, named only as Linda, but whose surname it later emerged is Senekal, and asked for her side of the story. She basically confirmed the story that she had not been forced into the cage. She said she asked the “baas” for a lift, and he dropped her off in town.
In Afrikaans, she agreed with the interviewer that it had been her choice to get into the back, and the farmer had apparently offered for her to sit in front.
She said it was hot and “we are used to sitting at the back”.
She reiterated that she wanted to sit on the back of the bakkie because of the heat, and she apparently agreed with the interviewer that she had been done a favour.
The interviewer complained that “good deeds” were now being misinterpreted and that people were trying to make out that something bad had happened.
