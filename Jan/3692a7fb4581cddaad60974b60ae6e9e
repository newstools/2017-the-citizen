Economic Freedom Fighter (EFF) leader Julius Malema announced on Thursday that he will be visiting the arrested #FeesMustFall student leader Education Khanyile at the Westiville Prison, in KwaZulu-Natal on Sunday. Khanyile was arrested at the Durban University of Technology on September 27, during the violent #FeesMustFall protests. He remains the only student behind bars after being denied bail by the Durban Magistrate s Court. Magistrate Jackie Jonck denied Khanyile bail reasoning that the large support base for Khanyile in court indicated his influence over others. Among those who will be joining Malema to his visit to Westville Prison is Floyd Shivambu, Godrick Gardee, Advocate Dali Mpofu and Phiwaba Madokwe for the EFF Student Command. Gardee, EFF secretary-general, said the movement would be sending a message of support to Khanyile. He said they would leave no stone untouched to ensure he is released and confirmed the movement is offering legal support to students in need. However he did say the EFF was not an organisation to provide legal representatives. We will tell him to keep strong and know that his country and it s people are in solidarity with him in this time of trauma, he said. African News Agency (ANA)
