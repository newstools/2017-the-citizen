The Vereeniging Magistrates Court on Thursday agreed to postpone murder accused Mark Zinde s case to obtain a high court date where he is set to appear. Zinde who stands accused of murdering his mother, television personality, Hope Zinde, and then assaulting his father, Dr Lebohang Mohale Manoto has had his cases centralised and will stand trial in the Pretoria High Court. The 23-year-old, who has undergone psychiatric evaluation and treatment, has been appearing in the Brits Regional Court, accused of the murder of his mother in June 2016 at her home in Pecanwood outside Brits. While out on bail of R10 000 paid for by his father, Zinde allegedly attacked his father with a glass a few months later on November 6. Hope Zinde was a former television anchor and board member of the South African Broadcasting Corporation. The accused s bail has since been revoked, and he is being remanded in custody. The case was postponed to February 22 for a court date to be set. On Wednesday, the Brits Regional Court, where Zinde appeared for allegedly killing his mother, dismissed his application to be admitted to the Weskoppies Psychiatric Hospital. This was after Francois Joubert, Zinde s defence counsel, applied to the court for his client to be referred to Weskoppies. Joubert had told the court that Zinde suffered from schizophrenia and wanted him to be admitted to Weskoppies for further assessment. The defence had disputed Weskoppies Psychiatric Hospital s assessment report on the mental state of Zinde, which had found him fit to stand trial, and instead, roped in the service of Dr John Weinkove, who argued that a brain scan was needed and recommended that Zinde be referred back to Weskoppies. This was, however, dismissed by the court. African News Agency For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
