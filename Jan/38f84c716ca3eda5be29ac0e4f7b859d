There are some decent other riders and they will not go down without a fight. Trainer Geoff Woodruff has a good record when he sends out runners in these races and could give Francis Semela the perfect start as the filly Sea Bean looks hard to oppose in the first race. This Philanthropist filly is the best bet on the card. Sea Bean only found Sun Sentinel 0.40 lengths too good for her on debut in December and was not disgraced this month when third to Lucky Lulu. Both of her starts were over the 1400m so she will prefer the 2000m of this race. Woodruff could also win Race 2, a Maiden Plate over 2000m as Private Swarovski has done enough in his three starts to date to make one confident of a big run from this three-year-old gelding. The step up in trip is sure to suit the Goodman Dadamasi-ridden gelding as he clearly found the shorter short of ideal. Finding winners gets a lot harder after the first two races and we will need to find some value to keep afloat and Sharp Link in Race 4 a Maiden Plate over 1000m could provide some Eachway value. This Brett Warren-trained colt disappointed last time out but has done a lot better in the past. If the Dupont colt can find the form that saw him be runner-up behind Harry s Silver in October and third to Clever Guy a month later he should run a decent race. A bet that could be worth taking is the swinger 1&#215;10 in Race 5, a Maiden Plate over 1200m as both Barbarella Nights and Moss Gas are improving sorts and could fight out the finish. Barbarella Nights was third to Torre Del Oro over 1400m last time out while Moss Gas was third to promising newcomer Grand Roche over this course and distance last week.
