This guy went to Riverside Mall in Nelspruit, Mpumalanga, and bought a pair of Timberlands and other &#8220;expensive&#8221; things and made everyone who saw him know what he had just spent his money on. In a video that has been circulating on social media for a while, a guy can be seen walking out of a store and taking out his newly-bought shoes for the world to see. He sings praises to the shoes, saying their price could very well be someone&#8217;s salary. He then opens another bag with a clothing item in it and told people that stores only folded clothes the way they did his because they were expensive. Watch the video below posted by Taky M Chanchie:
