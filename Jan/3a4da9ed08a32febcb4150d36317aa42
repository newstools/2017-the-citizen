Banjul. Gambian President Adama Barrow s team announced Monday his vice-president would be a woman who has vowed to prosecute former leader Yahya Jammeh and take back assets she says were stolen from the nation.The alleged plunder of some 11 million by Jammeh as he clung on to power in recent weeks has left the tiny African country in financial difficulty, a Barrow aide said. Barrow, who was sworn in as the new head of state on January 19 at his country s embassy in neighbouring Senegal, has put off his return over fears for his safety.As the nation waits, Barrow s second-in-command was named as Fatoumata Jallow-Tambajang, who became a controversial figure after telling The Guardian newspaper Jammeh would be prosecuted for crimes committed by his regime.Jammeh initially conceded defeat after the December 1 election, but the mercurial strongman announced he no longer recognised the result after Jallow-Tambajang s comments, and after the election commission issued revised results which made Barrow s win narrower, although still clear.The timing of her appointment comes after an aide to Barrow has accused Jammeh of raiding state coffers during his final days in power. Over two weeks, over 500 million dalasi ($11 million) were withdrawn by Jammeh, Mai Fatty said on Sunday in Dakar. As we take over, the government of The Gambia is in financial distress. Jammeh also took luxury cars he piled onto a Chadian cargo plane, Fatty said.A development expert who previously worked of the United Nations, Jallow-Tambajang is often described as the woman who persuaded The Gambia s divided opposition parties to club together and field a single candidate -- Barrow.She has also argued that a national commission for asset recovery should be established to take back land and goods Jammeh is accused of seizing for his own gain. Under the threat of a regional military intervention, Jammeh chose exile in Equatorial Guinea, which is not party to the International Criminal Court, and left The Gambia on Saturday.That means he cannot be extradited in the event he is charged with crimes against humanity or other serious offences.A truth and reconciliation committee is Barrow s preferred method of dealing with grievances against the regime, his spokesman has said, but many Gambians take the harder line of his new vice-president. Sections of the security services were under Jammeh s personal control and are responsible for extrajudicial killings, torture and arbitrary detention, rights groups say. (AFP)
