A woman was killed and two other people were injured when two trucks collided head-on on the R104 in Rustenburg on Saturday, North West paramedics said. ER24 paramedics, along with another service, arrived on the scene and found both wrecked vehicles in the middle of the road. A load of fruit and vegetables was spread across the scene, ER24 spokesman Russel Meiring said. Upon closer inspection, paramedics found the body of a woman trapped inside one of the trucks. Unfortunately, paramedics found that the woman had already succumbed to her multiple, fatal injuries. Nothing could be done for her and she was declared dead on the scene. Two other people were found on the scene, but after being assessed they were found to have sustained minor injuries. They were treated for their injuries and transported by another service to a nearby hospital. Local authorities closed off the road to conduct their investigation, Meiring said.
