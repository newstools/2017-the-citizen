Kagiso Rabada insists he only needs to rest when he has some &#8220;time off&#8221; but that&#8217;s not how the Proteas coaching staff see it. Charl Langeveldt, South Africa&#8217;s bowling coach, on Monday suggested the upcoming T20 series against Sri Lanka represents the ideal opportunity to afford Rabada a break. Also read: Kagiso Rabada dealing with the &#8216;Village People&#8217; The 21-year-old fast bowler&#8217;s workload has been in the spotlight lately, especially after his brilliant ten-wicket haul in last week&#8217;s second Test at Newlands. &#8220;There&#8217;s probably a good chance (of him being rested) with the T20s coming up,&#8221; said Langeveldt. &#8220;We can&#8217;t deny KG&#8217;s had a heavy workload over the past year. We&#8217;ve got a hectic schedule coming up and we can&#8217;t risk losing him in the long run.&#8221; Few people will actually mind his absence as the three-match T20 series against the Islanders, which starts on January 20, is basically has no context. There is no World T20 tournament to build up to. With the Proteas sniffing a 3-0 clean sweep in the current Test series, there seems to be no temptation to leave him out for the third battle at the Wanderers from Thursday. In fact, given how Rabada has taken 14 wickets on relatively unfriendly pitches to date, Langeveldt is keen to see him bowl an expected bowler&#8217;s surface. &#8220;This wicket will definitely suit KG a bit more,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There&#8217;s extra bounce here, which is good for his pace. &#8220;This is his home ground with the Highveld Lions. He took his first Test five-wicket haul here too. I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;s itching to play.&#8221; Langeveldt also mentioned he&#8217;s excited to see how rookie Knights quick Duanne Olivier might perform after coming in as Kyle Abbott&#8217;s replacement. &#8220;He probably has the ability to keep it tight but I think he&#8217;s more of an attacking bowler.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
