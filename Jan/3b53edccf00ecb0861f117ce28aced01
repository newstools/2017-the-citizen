Click here for a live scorecard. 16.52: Play called off for the day. 16.19: The umpires have decided to call off the players due to bad light. SL 80/4. 16.13: Drinks. Mathews and Chandimal have grimly hung on in gloomy conditions. According to a weather radar, a storm is heading the Wanderers&#8217; way. SL 80/4. 15.42: GONE! The batting demons are back for Sri Lanka (did they ever leave?). Vernon Philander is back in the attack and has Dhananjaya de Silva driving unwisely as Temba Bavuma completes at catch at gully. SL 70/4. 15.33: OUT! Rabada has Kusal Mendis again with a brute of a delivery. He is a short fellow and can&#8217;t do anything to fend off a rapid short one. It&#8217;s a disappointing end to a nice innings. SL 62/3. 15.09: WICKET! You can&#8217;t keep him out of the game too long. Kagiso Rabada comes back after tea full of intent and snaffles Kaushal Silva&#8217;s wicket with a beauty. SL 47/2. 14.40: And that&#8217;s tea. The compact Kusal Mendis has certainly impressed with a few spanking shots as Sri Lanka reach 46/1. 14.26: Debutant Duanne Olivier is in the attack as the second-wicket pair survive the new ball. SL 32/1. 14.06: Philander and Wayne Parnell have been bowling superbly without luck. Parnell in particular has found his range after bowling too full in his first over. SL 9/1. 13.43: OUT! But it doesn&#8217;t matter. Karunaratne edges two balls later. Shocking start for Sri Lanka. SL 0/1. 13.42: And so the poor reviews starts again! A beauty from Vernon Philander moves away from Dimuth Karunaratne, who withdraws his bat. South Africa thinks he&#8217;s nicked it but the review shows otherwise. 13.28: OUT! Quinton de Kock hits out for 34 as the Proteas are dismissed for 426. Given their platform, the end result is a bit underwhelming. SA 426 all out. 13.17: WICKET! De Kock and Parnell have been having a bit of fun, before Parnell&#8217;s breezy 23 comes to an end in the outfield. SA 425/9. 12.52: Lunch is done an dusted. South Africa go past 400 with a Quinton de Kock boundary. How long before the declaration comes? Will there even come one? SA 403/8. 12.01: Wayne Parnell and Quinton de Kock have nudged South Africa closer to 400. Is that the mark where the Proteas will declare? It&#8217;s lunch time for now. SA 398/8. 11.39: GONE! Inspired spell this from Nuwan Pradeep. Another beauty outside off to Vernon Philander and another grab for keeper Dinesh Chandimal. SA 378/8. 11.37: Interesting rule this. Vernon Philander is caught down the leg-side but because the glove that hit the ball wasn&#8217;t holding the bat, he&#8217;s not out after reviewing. SA 377/7. 11.25: OUT! The Hashim Amla marathon is over. He&#8217;s out for 134. The Proteas are collapsing in the face of some excellent bowling on a spicy pitch. Philander and co will be licking their lips. SA 367/7. 11.10: WICKET! Temba Bavuma&#8217;s lean run continues. Really rash drive wide outside off and a smart grab in the slips. He needs to be more disciplined at the start of his innings. SA 364/6. 11.05: GONE! The Faf drop isn&#8217;t too expensive. Fabulous ball from Nuwan Pradeep, squares up the Proteas skipper and he can only edge to slip. SA 364/5. 11.00: First drinks break of the day. Faf du Plessis has recovered from a painful blow on his tummy to play some delightful strokes, while Hashim Amla keeps being a rock. SA 364/4. 10.40: Another misfield takes the Proteas past 350. 10.38: DROPPED! Beautiful delivery from Suranga Lakmal, whose extra bounce deceives Faf du Plessis. But the catch is spilled by Kusal Mendis at second slip. More pain for the visitors. SA 348/4. 10.32: OUT! It&#8217;s been a pretty painful effort this from Duanne Olivier, though it&#8217;s hardly his fault. He edges a regulation delivery from Angelo Mathews behind. It&#8217;s initially given not out but the review reveals a feather. SA 346/4. 10.16: Any thoughts of the Proteas scoring quickly this morning has been put on hold. The Sri Lankans have kept their lines tight. SA 340/3. 9.51: Was there a better script than Hashim Amla&#8217;s 100 on Thursday? The best part of it was that he never even thought really about his 100th Test. Read more here. 9.50: Sunny conditions at the Wanderers after a bit of overnight rain. It will be interesting to see how long Faf du Plessis wants to bat on. South Africa in a powerful position on 338/3. For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
