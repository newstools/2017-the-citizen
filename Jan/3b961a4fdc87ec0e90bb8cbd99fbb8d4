Dean Elgar might now be considered the bolter of the Proteas Test batting line-up after his Man-of-the-Series performance against Sri Lanka. But he doesn t want to stop there. Also read: There s a chance AB de Villiers is giving up Test cricket In fact, following Rilee Rossouw s departure on a Kolpak contract, the gritty opener wants to be a one-day player too. I very much want to play white-ball cricket for the Proteas, said Elgar. There s nothing wrong with my technique against the white ball. I really think I have a lot to offer. The 29-year-old notably led the Titans to the domestic One-day Cup final in 2014/15, scoring 440 runs in the process as well and actually boasts a very good record in the format. He s scored 4 189 runs at an excellent average of 39 and good strike rate of 77. Yet Russell Domingo, the Proteas coach, isn t quite sold on the idea, especially with AB de Villiers returning as captain for the series against the Islanders. Also read: Russell Domingo: Proteas can&#8217;t measure progress via rankings The one-day batting line-up is quite settled. In particular, there isn t much room in the top six at the moment, he said. That said, Dean is definitely a very suitable player in one-day cricket. He can easily slot in the top three and has the numbers to back it up. He s in the mix with quite a few others like Theunis de Bruyn and Temba Bavuma. I m happy with the amount of fringe players we could look at. It s not words that will discourage Elgar because he has another card up his sleeve his more that useful left-arm spinners. I don t bowl much in the Test side because I probably can t offer all that much, he said. But it s different in limited overs cricket, where I really believe I can offer a few good overs. I realise my tours with the Test side means I haven t played much limited overs cricket in the last year but I m putting both my hands and feet up for inclusion.
