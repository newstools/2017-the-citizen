It&#8217;s unlikely this Test will last five days. 17.57: That sums up Sri Lanka&#8217;s day. Lahiru Kumara produces an awkward delivery for Dean Elgar but it&#8217;s pretty clear the LBW shout won&#8217;t go their way. Still, Angelo Mathews asks for a review and it&#8217;s not a good one. When will they learn?? SA 34/0. 17.23: The Protea openers have looked in no discomfort. In fact, the bowling has been rather meek. SA 14/0, the lead is already almost 300. 17.02: GONE! The end was merciless and swift for the Sri Lankans. Another edge, another wicket for Philander. SL all out for 110. South Africa WON&#8217;T enforce the follow-on. 16.59: AND ANOTHER! 19-year-old Lahiru Kumara shows his inexperience by leaving a Philander delivery on his stumps. Clearly misjudged the length. SL 100/9. 16.50: OUT! 150th Test scalp for Vernon Philander. Pretty regulation that dismissal &#8211; Lakmal prods at a ball slightly outside off and the ball loops to slip, where Dean Elgar parries it to Hashim Amla. SL 100/8. 16.44: GONE! Vernon Philander clearly had Rangana Herath&#8217;s number in that knock. Three times caught on the crease, third time lucky with the LBW. SL 100/7. 16.41: Upul Tharanga has kept his cool after surviving a poor sweep off Maharaj. Brings up Sri Lanka&#8217;s 100 with a nice square drive. SL 100/6. 16.12: WICKET! Poor from Dinesh Chandimal. Rabada bowls a mundane, wide delivery that really should be left. However, he takes the bait and gets the edge. Sri Lanka in disarray on 78/6. 16.08: OUT! It&#8217;s Perth all over again for Keshav Maharaj. Dhananjaya de Silva dances down the track trying to work him to leg but misses and Rod Tucker isn&#8217;t afraid to raise the finger. De Silva knows it doesn&#8217;t matter how far down the pitch he is yet believes he might&#8217;ve been hit outside off, so reviews. It&#8217;s umpire&#8217;s call and the decision stands. A bit unlucky for the young Sri Lankan. SL 78/5. 15.51: GONE! Rabada is a menace. Lovely, steep bounce creates doubt in Angelo Mathews&#8217; and he merely fends the delivery to the slips. SL 60/4. 15.35: WICKET! Three balls after tea, Kagiso Rabada bowls a long hop to Dimuth Karunaratne that he cuts no further than Temba Bavuma at point. It&#8217;s a fine grab. The visitors are now in trouble. SL 56/3. 15.06: OUT! Kusal Mendis has a rush of blood after the previous over&#8217;s six and tries to slog Maharaj again. He gets a top-edge and JP Duminy completes a good catch. SL 56/2. And that&#8217;s tea. 15.01: Kusal Mendis slog sweeps Keshav Maharaj, taking Sri Lanka past 50. Finally, a bit of action as the visitors were starting to become bogged down. SL 54/1. 14.30: GONE! The perseverance pays off. Kagiso Rabada exploits some extra bounce and the compact Kaushal Silva&#8217;s height puts him at a disadvantage as his defensive shot merely goes back onto his stumps. SL 31/1. 14.13: Kagiso Rabada has released a bit of the pressure that his teammates built with a few wayward deliveries but he&#8217;s also creating chances. SL 29/0. 13.39: Kyle Abbott and Vernon Philander have been disciplined but the Sri Lankans have resisted to date. That wind isn&#8217;t helping Abbott. SL 11/0. 12.34: OUT! The Proteas are dismissed for 392. Superb spell by Kumara, who cuts Kagiso Rabada in two with another quick, accurate delivery. He ends with 6/122. 12.11: GONE! That&#8217;s five for 19-year-old Lahiru Kumara. Lovely length to Philander, who tries to drive and edges. This man is a real prospect. SA 376/8. 11.48: Two competent batters now at the crease and it shows. Keshav Maharaj and Vernon Philander have taken SA past 350. It&#8217;s become a good score this. SA 359/8. 11.17: GONE! It&#8217;s a fourth for 19-year-old Lahiru Kumara as he slants one into Quinton de Kock, who can only edge it. Good delivery to get rid of an in-form batter. SA 336/8. 11.14: It&#8217;s an inside edge to the boundary but they all count. Quinton de Kock celebrates a third Test century off only 121 deliveries. SA 334/7. 10.38: WICKET! Spin works for Sri Lanka. Herath&#8217;s extra bounce confounds Kyle Abbott as he edges one off the back-foot. SA 303/7. 10.31: Wow, nice start. De Kock punches the first ball of the day beautifully through the covers for four. It takes South Africa past 300. 10.25: Dean Elgar, who scored a career-high 129 on Monday, was a relieved man. Here&#8217;s why. 10.24: It&#8217;s day two at Newlands. The sun&#8217;s out but there&#8217;s a fresh breeze blowing. According to the pundits, the pitch remains a competitive one, meaning the Proteas will hope for the maximum amount of runs from Quinton de Kock.
