South Africa President Jacob Zuma on Friday extended his condolences on the death of South African gospel music star, Lundi Tyamara, who died earlier on Friday. The 38-year-old Mphefumlo Wami and Ndixolele hitmaker died just after midnight after a battle with Tuberculosis and a liver condition. We are deeply saddened by the loss of a talented artist at such a young age. This is yet another huge loss for the country in a short space of time. He was one of the best gospel artists that the country has ever produced. We are with his family in thoughts and prayers during this trying period. May his soul rest in peace, Zuma said in a statement. Tyamara had been admitted to hospital four weeks ago suffering from abdominal tuberculosis (TB) and a liver condition, his manager Anele Hlazo said. He took a turn for the worse on Monday and was moved to ICU and put on life support. Gauteng Premier David Makhura also extended his condolences to the family and fans of the late singer. Lundi s dedication and commitment to his craft saw him grow from humble beginnings into a household name in the gospel industry. On behalf of the people of Gauteng and the provincial government, I extend our condolences to the family, friends and the entire entertainment industry, said Makhura. Makhura described Tyamara as an amazingly talented artist, who had an incredible voice and a superb stage presence. We are deeply saddened at losing such a young talented life. May his soul rest in eternal peace, added Makhura.
