The bodies of a man and a woman were found burnt beyond recognition inside a house at Lufule 2 location, outside Thohoyandou on Sunday morning, Limpopo police said. Spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said that it was alleged that a 36-year-old man was last seen on Saturday night, at his partner s house until he was found dead with this partner inside the same house. The body of a 25-year-old woman was found in the kitchen whereas that of the man was found on the passage to the kitchen. The motive of this incident is still unknown but domestic violence may not be ruled out, Ngoepe said. The Police Forensic Investigators were summoned from Pretoria to come and determine the cause of fire. Members of the communities are once again advised and encouraged to desist from resorting to violence to solve domestic issues if this is the case. They are urged to seek help from the relevant Authorities including at our Victim Empowerment Centres in any of the Police Stations. Ngoepe said investigations continue and that no further information was available. African News Agency (ANA)
