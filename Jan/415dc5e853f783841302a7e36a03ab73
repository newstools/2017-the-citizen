Meet Mari Raudsepp, a white woman who has been trending on social media for doing the Vosho dance to Bhizer and Busiswa&#8217;s Qobisiqolo in Joburg this past weekend. Raudsepp&#8217;s dancing skills are so good that those who have been sharing her videos online say she may keep the piece of land she owns should EFF leader Julius Malema&#8217;s land policy comes into effect. Rausepp is from Sweden and studied at the University of Dance and Circus in Sweden and the Zimbabwe College of Music, which explains her mad skills on the dance floor. From her social media accounts, one can tell that dancing is what Rausepp does best and has been doing it every chance she gets. She has previously shared a video of her dancing on the streets Katlehong with guys she said were from the Vusi Arts Project in the area. Unfortunately, she has gone back to Sweden, but her friends say she&#8217;ll be back soon. Watch some of the videos she has posted: &#x1f49b;&#x1f49a;&#x1f499; A video posted by Mari Raudsepp (@mari_raudsepp) on Jan 10, 2017 at 4:53am PST Yesterdays dance .
