 It was with a deep shock that we heard of the sudden demise of Lundi Tyamara in the early hours of this morning. The nation has lost a creative son at such a tender age. But after a long battle with illness, we are consoled that he no longer suffers and is now at peace, Mthethwa said in a statement. The Mphefumlo Wami hitmaker died at around midnight at the Edenvale Hospital, east of Johannesburg, after battling with abdominal tuberculosis and a liver condition. He came to Johannesburg at the age of 16 to record his music. He showed great determination and great promise from the outset and was passionate about gospel music. His unique voice immediately made him very popular.
