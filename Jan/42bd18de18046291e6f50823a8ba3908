A 51-year-old motorcyclist was critically injured when he crashed into the side of an SUV on the R563 near Hekpoort, west of Johannesburg, on Sunday, Gauteng paramedics said. ER24 paramedics arrived on the scene and found the SUV and motorbike in the middle of the road, ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring said. The biker was found in the front of the SUV while the driver was found walking around on the scene. Paramedics assessed the biker and found that he had sustained critical injuries. Treatment and advanced life support interventions were immediately performed on the patient in an effort to stabilise his vital signs. Once treated, the man was airlifted by a private medical helicopter to a private hospital in Johannesburg for urgent treatment. The driver of the SUV was assessed and found to have escaped injury. It was believed that the SUV turned in front of the motorbike. The biker was unable to swerve in time, Meiring said. African News Agency (ANA)
