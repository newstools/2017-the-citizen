Four school children were killed and 18 were injured in a collision between a bus and a minibus taxi in Durban on Wednesday morning the first day of school this year. Robert McKenzie, spokesperson for the KwaZulu-Natal provincial Emergency Medical Service, said the accident took place on Nyala Road near the bus station in the city s Ntuzuma township. Initial reports were that there were six fatalities, however, it has now been confirmed that there are four fatalities. Tragically, it is schoolchildren who have sustained fatal injuries, he said. He said the deceased three boys and one girl were all below the age of 16 years. ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring said one side of the taxi had been ripped open. McKenzie said 18 people had been injured and were taken to various hospitals, with one of the patients being airlifted to hospital by helicopter. Emergency services, including multiple ambulance services, were still on scene at the time of writing. KwaZulu-Natal provincial education spokesperson Sihle Mlotshwa said he could confirm that it was four pupils who had died in the crash. This is a very sad day. It is meant to be a happy. I myself took my daughter to school and posted pictures of her. I can only begin to imagine what those parents are feeling. On behalf of the MEC I wish to express sincere condolences, said Mlotshwa. He said that he had no further details, but that education department officials were on their way to the scene to find out what had happened.
