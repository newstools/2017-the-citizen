When Wayne Parnell makes his return to Test cricket at the Wanderers on Thursday, you can bet many people will say: we&#8217;ve been here before. That is an understandable reaction. The 27-year-old left-arm quick is one of the most frustrating players to have turned out for the Proteas since re-admission. Also read: Turns out there is some rest for the wicked Kagiso Rabada Undeniably talented, Parnell has been dogged by injuries over the years and also struggles for consistency. It also doesn&#8217;t help that the former SA Under-19 skipper has continually been fast-tracked into the national side when it might&#8217;ve been better for him to keep on playing domestic cricket. At least the national selectors seemed to finally grasped that last season as Parnell played quite a lot of first-class cricket. Yet even if he can be considered a more mature player, Charl Langeveldt is wary of becoming overexcited again. In fact, the Proteas bowling coach is being very realistic. &#8220;I spoke to him long and hard,&#8221; said Langeveldt. &#8220;We need to see what Wayne has to offer. He needs to become more consistent in his lengths. That&#8217;s the only way you become successful at Test level.&#8221; Parnell shouldn&#8217;t expect to be granted the freedom to merely bowl and try to take wickets. Since the start of the international season, discipline has been the bowling attack&#8217;s keyword. &#8220;The big thing we&#8217;ve worked on is how many dot balls we can bowl in a row,&#8221; said Langeveldt. &#8220;We believe the runs must be dried up from both ends and that&#8217;s a challenge for some.&#8221; At least Parnell became aware of this philosophy in last year&#8217;s successful ODI series against Australia and worked on being steady. &#8220;It was a technical thing that we had to work on to make him more consistent. He rectified that by working hard in the nets with the Cobras,&#8221; said Langeveldt. &#8220;They sent me videos and we spoke back and forth. We ve worked on it the last couple of months.&#8221; Also read: No name brands get chance to shine for Proteas in T2o Encouragingly, Parnell took six wickets at minimal cost for the Capetonians in a domestic four-day game at the weekend. He also scored an unbeaten century. &#8220;It&#8217;s an ideal situation. We get him now having had some cricket under the belt. &#8220;That hasn&#8217;t always been the case,&#8221; said Langeveldt.
