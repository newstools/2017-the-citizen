It is no secret that Bonang Matheba and her boyfriend, Kiernan &#8216;AKA&#8217; Forbes, are in love and living their best life at the moment. Ever since they came out as a couple last year, they have been sharing snaps of each other and going on holidays together. They are recently in Thailand where AKA is set to shoot The World Is Yours music video, and their holiday is nothing short of amazing. AKA told fans he was having the time of his life on a holiday that cost him &#8220;an arm and a Rolex&#8221;. Also read: AKA won&#8217;t be humiliated by &#8216;flying business class again&#8217; He shared a gorgeous picture of Bonang in a bikini, and, of course, there were negative comments on it. Twitter does not seem to like AKA&#8217;s attitude and &#8220;arrogance&#8221;, but with Bonang, it is a different matter. Bonang has been called every name under the sun for dating AKA when he was still with DJ Zinhle, who was still pregnant. She has also dated other guys in the entertainment industry, including Nigerian musician D&#8217;Banj, and Twitter is not about to let AKA forget that. @akaworldwide D&#39;banj, Slikour, Euphonik looking at this pic and going &quot;I hit that!!!&quot; pic.twitter.com/hIjEOMcPMb &mdash; Cersai Lannister (@its_true47) January 11, 2017 One of AKA&#8217;s followers reminded him that he was dating a girl who has &#8220;done&#8221; the Nigerian musician, thinking he would take it laying down. Responding to the follower, AKA said everyone had a history, only that theirs is talked about most. Everybody has a history, the only difference is that we&#39;re famous &#8230;. and you&#39;re nobody. https://t.co/0AXGmmGnap &mdash; AKA (@akaworldwide) January 11, 2017
