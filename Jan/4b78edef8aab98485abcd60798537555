Dar es Salaam. Researchers are carrying out clinical trials on a preventive medicine for leprosy in Tanzania and five other affected countries in an effort to curb the bacterial disease.This came to light yesterday as the country marked the World Leprosy Day, with figures from the World Health Organisation (WHO) showing that leprosy affected 212,000 more people globally in 2015. In Tanzania, four out of every 100,000 people have the disease.According to evidence published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), researchers are identifying any person who might have been in contact with leprosy patients in the households and later evaluating them for treatment.The study is titled: Leprosy Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (LPEP) programme: study protocol for evaluating the feasibility and impact on case detection rates of contact tracing and single dose rifampicin. It s also going on in India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Nepal, and Sri Lanka.Through preventive treatment strategy, the experts from research institutions in Switzerland and Netherlands are collaborating with local leprosy programmes and the government in finding ways to eliminate the disease.In Tanzania, the study is being carried out in three municipalities that are more affected by leprosy, according to a local leprosy researcher Dr Boniface Manditi.Dr Manditi, who is also the Acting District Medical Officer for Ifakara, told The Citizen yesterday that the study is being carried out in Kilombero District in Morogoro Region, Liwale District in Lindi Region and Nanyumbu District in Mtwara Region.He said, When the study is completed, we will then be able to evaluate how we can eliminate leprosy in Tanzania effectively. Experts believe by identifying and treating all people affected by leprosy, the transmission of the disease can be minimised in communities.The Minister for Health, Community Development, Gender, Children and the Elderly, Ms Ummy Mwalimu told The Citizen on Friday that studies on preventive treatment chemoprophylaxis are part of the government s strategy dubbed the Final Push to Eliminate Leprosy.
