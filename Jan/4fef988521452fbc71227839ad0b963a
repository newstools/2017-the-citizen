While Muthambi heads up the communications ministry and has not spoken on any ambitions to become premier, City Press has reported that she is the first choice to take over from Mathabatha. According to the newspaper, it is only a matter of time before Mathabatha leaves the top job as efforts to oust him have reached a final stage. Muthambi has declined to comment, calling the report innuendo and rumour. Meanwhile, the ANCYL has stated that it is so ready for his departure that a celebration is being planned once he leaves. Mathabatha has been accused of failing to lead and unite the province with logistical issues continuing to plague, such as the delivery of textbooks. A former ambassador, Mathabatha has also been slammed for not prioritising government and party events, instead sending representatives to fulfil his duties.

He is not building any legacy for the youth and frankly has got no time or showed no interest when he had to meet us and discuss issues affecting the youth in the province,&#8221; said Limpopo ANCYL spokesperson Matome Moremi. Mathabatha has denied knowledge of a plot to have him removed from his position. Instead he said he had united the province and strengthened it, getting rid of &#8216;shenanigans&#8217; that had occurred under the previous administration. Mathabatha concluded that he would go where the ANC redeployed him as he had been a member of the organisation for 40 years. A source said this was untrue and the premier knew very well he would have to relinquish power soon by resigning. Zizi Kodwa, spokesperson for the ANC, has said he was unaware of the claims.
