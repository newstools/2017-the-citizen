A high level task team has been appointed to investigate the allegations of corruption in the Eastern Cape municipalities, the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (the Hawks) said on Thursday. Spokesperson Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi said that the team was appointed by Hawks head Lieutenant General Mthandazo Ntlemeza. Corrupt officials rob our people of the basic services and as the unit entrusted with rooting out corruption at all institutions we have formulated a task team that will ruffle the feathers at the affected municipalities, Ntlemeza said in a statement. We are determined to uproot corruption and should our investigations find anyone found to be on the wrong side of the law, that person will feel the wrath of the Hawks and the mighty of our justice system. We cannot sit down and fold our arms as opportunistic individuals prey on innocent citizens by denying them their Constitutional Rights through corruption. &#8220;The task team will be led by a highly experienced brigadier from the Hawks who played a pivotal role during his tenure as part of the joint anti-task team led by the National Prosecuting Authority between 2003 and 2005,&#8221; Mulaudzi said. The task team will be comprised of investigators from the Hawks, NPA prosecutors as well as Asset Forfeiture Unit members. OR Tambo District Municipality, Engcobo Municipality, Butterworth, Mnquma Local Municipality and Mthatha have been identified as the hub of the alleged corrupt activities, he said. More task teams will be formulated to tackle corruption at other municipalities at various provinces, Mulaudzi said.
