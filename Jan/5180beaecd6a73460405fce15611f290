An off-duty police officer stationed at Rosebank in Johannesburg was shot dead in the early hours of Saturday morning in Devland, Eldorado Park, Gauteng police said on Saturday. This unfortunate incident happens just two days after another police officer suffered the same fate during a business robbery in Katlehong North, police said in a statement on the official South African Police Service (SAPS) Facebook page. It was alleged that the officer noticed someone fiddling with his bakkie parked next to a window. He got dressed, took his firearm, and stepped outside. According to a witness, two gunshots were fired and it was confirmed after some time by neighbours that the police sergeant had been shot. Gauteng police commissioner Lt-Gen Deliwe de Lange had noted with deep concern the aggression and brazenness of criminals who would not think twice to take an innocent life, the statement said. The police in Gauteng will mobilise all resources and join forces with all relevant crime fighting entities to ensure that the suspects are caught and brought to book. De Lange appealed to members of the public to partner with the police and report these criminals so that they were rooted out of these communities and thrown in prison where they belonged. The manhunt by Gauteng police will be intensified in pursuit of the Devland suspects as well as the five that were involved in the killing in Katlehong North, who are still at large. Members of the public were urged to come forward with any information they believed would assist police in apprehending the suspects by calling the emergency number 08600-10111, or alternatively contacting the nearest police station.
