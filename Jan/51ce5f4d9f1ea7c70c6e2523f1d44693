Serena Williams said she had to dig deep to see off her sister Venus and finally win a record 23rd Grand Slam title at the Australian Open on Saturday. Serena overcame a nervy and error-strewn start when she smashed a racquet in frustration before reeling in a tense 6-4, 6-4 victory in one hour, 22 minutes. It was all about the result for Serena, who clinched a new Open-era record of 23 major wins, overhauling Steffi Graf&#8217;s 22 &#8211; and returned to world number one into the bargain. &#8220;Today was all heart out there, I was just fighting. The fact that she is so good made it that much harder,&#8221; Serena told Australia&#8217;s Channel Seven. She added: &#8220;I swear I didn&#8217;t hit the racquet that hard &#8211; how did it crack that much?&#8221; Newly-engaged Serena, 35, said she deliberately avoided any talk of Graf&#8217;s record during the tournament, a strategy that helped her relax. &#8220;It is crazy. I knew I had a chance (of breaking the record). But I didn&#8217;t like to talk about records anymore. That helped me relax,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I came into this tournament really thinking that I didn t have anything to lose and nothing to prove. I just told myself to have fun and it worked for me. I was relaxed this time.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
