The outcome of the Aloe Handicap (Non-Black Type) for three-year-old fillies over 1300m at Fairview today could be determined by how well O Tamara handles the Polytrack. This daughter of Argonaut has an outstanding record on the turf at Fairview with four wins and four places from eight starts. However, her one blemish in Port Elizabeth was her run on the Polytrack in which she finished fifth behind Peonie Rock. The distance behind the winner was only 1.80 lengths so there still could be improvement to come on that performance. There were other contributing factors. It was her first run after an almost three-month layoff so she could have been in need of the run. She also drifted in the betting from 8-10 to 18-10 so the disappointing performance might not have been a major surprise to the connections. Trainer Alan Greeff then took her to Kenilworth to run in the Grade 1 Cape Fillies Guineas where she met some potent opposition but she jumped from a wide draw and was never in the race. The Aloe Handicap will be her first run in 76 days and could be quite a stern test for O Tamara. She is well drawn at No 2 and will be ridden by in-form Greg Cheyne but she has to give weight to all. The better option could be stable companion Oklahoma Sky. She has had four runs on the Polytrack for two wins and two places and in her only run over the course and distance finished 0.50 lengths behind Dance In The Woods who won again since. For a three-year-old to run that well against older horses in an open handicap is quite an achievement and the daughter of Tiger Ridge could be the right one. Teaque Gould, who has ridden her in all of her starts, is aboard again and they jump from barrier No 4. Others to consider are Star Burst Galaxy, Maverick Girl and Candy Crush.
