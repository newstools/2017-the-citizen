The Vaal University of Technology (VUT) has set aside close to a million in bursaries for top performing matric pupils. The bursaries will be available to the students for the duration of their study period, provided they pass all the registered modules. Mike Khuboni, the executive director for corporate affairs at VUT, said the institution recognised and appreciated brilliant students who entered its doors. Top achievers will be identified and offered these bursaries during the registration process. An assessment will be done to ensure students meet all the requirements. He said at the end of the registration process, the selection process to award the bursaries would commence. The first two bursary categories are available to 14 students who scored between 80 and 100% in their grade 12 examination results, as well as sports champions. The two bursary categories will be available for the duration of the study period provided the student passes all the courses taken for the academic semester. The next category is meant to assist students with registration fee and study facilities. This is available to the first six students to arrive at the VUT registration point with all the necessary documents. It was previously reported that the institution s online registration system was experiencing hiccups, however, Khuboni said everything had been running smoothly. VUT has, in addition, implemented a self-help registration process to ensure smooth and easy registration for all students. To date, approximately 5000 students have been registered.
