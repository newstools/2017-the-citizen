Long-distance runner Lusapho April will aim to make history during the European spring season when he targets a record fourth victory at the Hannover Marathon. The two-time Olympian confirmed on Monday he would return to the annual race, to be held in Germany on April 9. &#8220;I am delighted to be returning to defend my Hannover Marathon title,&#8221; April revealed on social media. After winning the 42km race in 2011 and 2013, when he set the course record of 2:08:32, the Eastern Cape star returned for a third career victory last year. Should he successfully defend his crown this season, April would become the first athlete to win the annual contest four times. For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
