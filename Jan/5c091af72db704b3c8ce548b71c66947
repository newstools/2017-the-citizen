The 2017 Africa Cup of Nations has reached its quarterfinal stage, with a couple of the favourites already floating off into the Gabonese sunset. Champions Ivory Coast are gone, a younger generation of Elephants unable to produce the goods of two years ago. And so are Algeria, a golden generation of Desert Foxes failing to meet expectations. Senegal stand out as the team to beat, Aliou Cisse s side cruising through the group stages, though they meet another West African giant in Cameroon in the quarterfinals. Democratic Republic of Congo are the surprise package, Florent Ibenge, like Cisse with Senegal, doing African coaches proud. Ghana have the only Absa Premiership player left in the competition, in Orlando Pirates defender Edwin Gyimah, although he has not played in nine consecutive matches, from the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations finals to this year s event. There is also an NFD representative left in Santos and Burkina Faso defender Issouf Paro, although he has also not featured for the Stallions. Otherwise, PSL representation in the competition is gone, most with Zimbabwe, who failed to build on an impressive opening draw with Algeria and were battered by Senegal and Tunisia. Those South Africans laughing at the Warriors should hold their tongues, however at least Zimbabwe qualified. For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
