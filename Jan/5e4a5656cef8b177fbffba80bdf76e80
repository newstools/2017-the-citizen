Staff members of a nursing academy in central Pretoria fled protesting students on Tuesday by locking themselves inside a storeroom, Pretoria East Rekord reports. The principal of the Thuto Bophelo Nursing Academy in Struben Street was among the group, said staff member Rina Peusschers. Peusschers said disgruntled students claimed around lunchtime that they had been given the wrong information about their courses and an argument with staff ensued. They are having issues about everything, even the uniform, Peusschers said.
