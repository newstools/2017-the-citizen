Click here for a live scorecard. 17.27: Poor debutant Duanne Olivier has been sent in as nightwatchman. Talk about a baptism of fire. Anyway, he survives and the Proteas end the day on 338/3, with Hashim Amla on 125. 17.17: OUT! What a shame. Duminy tries to do much of the same, but this time finds the fielder. He&#8217;s out for a splendid 155. SA 337/3. 17.15: This is a truly magnificent innings from JP Duminy. He reaches his 150 with a silky glide to third man and can&#8217;t be praised enough for how he&#8217;s shepherded Amla in this innings. SA 337/2. 16.53: A relatively quiet period now as Duminy (143) and Amla (118) look to wind down an excellent day&#8217;s work. SA 318/2. 16.28: 300 up for South Africa. You almost can&#8217;t believe the start was so slow! SA 302/2. 16.23: There it is! A thumping charge down the wicket off Rangana Herath takes Amla past 100. He becomes the eighth player in history to score a 100 in his 1ooth Test. Magical stuff. SA 296/2. 16.08: It&#8217;s now becoming ugly for the Sri Lankans. JP Duminy has cruised to 125, while Hashim Amla is suddenly in sight of a century on 93. SA 275/2. 15.38: Amla is finally playing some confident drives again. One of them reaches the boundary to take his fourth-wicket partnership with Duminy to 202. SA 247/2. 15.17: This has been a splendid effort from JP Duminy, a sixth Test century off only 140 deliveries. SA 215/2. 15.11: 200 up for the Proteas! 14.43: There we go! It was painful to watch at times but Hashim Amla has his first score over 50 for 11 Test innings. He&#8217;ll go to tea a happy (and relieved) man. JP Duminy is on 87. SA 193/2. 14.07: JP Duminy&#8217;s 12th four takes the Proteas past 150. SA 152/2. 14.00: And a century stand for Hashim Amla in his 100th Test. It&#8217;s still being dominated by Duminy though. SA 145/2. 13.44: First drinks break after lunch. Duminy is silky on 56 and even Hashim Amla is starting to look a tad more comfortable on 19. SA 133/2. 13.17: 50 for JP Duminy. Except for the edge through the slips to reach it, it&#8217;s been an excellent effort. 10 fours in the 62-ball effort. SA 114/2. 13.11: Finally, Hashim Amla&#8217;s first boundary! Took him merely 41 deliveries. Granted, he punished the gift from Nuwan Pradeep ruthlessly. SA 104/2. 13.04: JP Duminy now in full flow. Brings up South Africa&#8217;s 100 with a sumptuous drive. SA 100/2. 13.01: 50 partnership between Amla and Duminy. Well, Duminy&#8230; SA 95/2. 12.58: Lunch is over and Hashim Amla continues to scratch. He hasn&#8217;t added to his score yet. Meanwhile, JP Duminy &#8211; who came in after him &#8211; is already on 31. SA 87/2. 12.02: The Mighty Hash&#8217;s innings has been painful to watch. He&#8217;ll go to lunch on six and was dropped in the last over before the lunch break. The confidence outside off-stump is not there. SA 79/2. 11.33: But now he is. A quick single from a defensive prod. 11.32: South Africa go past a painful 50. Hashim Amla still isn&#8217;t off the mark. 11.25: Oh, and this was Hashim Amla&#8217;s 100th Test moment&#8230; Hashim Amla&#39;s (@amlahash) moment, walking out to a hearty applause. #SAvSL #Amla100 @TheCitizenSport pic.twitter.com/jxCWPoIHYX &mdash; Heinz Schenk (@sportmal) January 12, 2017 11.22: GONE! One brings two (again!). Lahiru Kumara has really impressed since starting at Newlands. Extra bounce confounds Dean Elgar, who plays a nasty waft that gets the edge. SA 45/2. 11.16: OUT! Cook is trapped in front by the gentle medium pace of Angelo Mathews. It&#8217;s plumb but he reviews and seemed to have a case for a n0-ball. But these things are always tight&#8230; SA 45/1. 10.47: It&#8217;s taken 11 overs for the Proteas to hit their first boundary. It is a lovely, crisp straight drive from Dean Elgar though. SA 21/0. 10.25: Ironically, it seems Faf du Plessis&#8217; decision to bat was a good one. Not much alarm for the openers. SA 11/0. 10.07: The first over is completed. It certainly was a testing one for Stephen Cook against the ever-willing Suranga Lakmal, but the Proteas opener ends it with a three off the last ball. SA 3/0. 9.35: Here are the teams: Proteas: Stephen Cook, Dean Elgar, Hashim Amla, JP Duminy, Faf du Plessis, Temba Bavuma, Quinton de Kock, Vernon Philander, Wayne Parnell, Kagiso Rabada, Duanne Olivier. Sri Lanka: Dimuth Karunaratne, Kaushal Silva, Kusal Mendis, Dhananjaya de Silva, Angelo Mathews, Dinesh Chandimal, Upul Tharanga, Rangana Herath, Suranga Lakmal, Nuwan Pradeep, Lahiru Kumara. 9.33: South Africa go for a four-man pace attack, meaning Duanne Olivier of the Knights makes his debut. 9.30: Welcome to the Wanderers, where Faf du Plessis has won the toss in the third Test and chose to bat.
