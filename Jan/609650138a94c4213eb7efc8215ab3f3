A German couple s unusual addition to the family is making headlines in Germany after they took on a baby tiger that had been rejected by its mother at the circus. Born four months ago during a travelling circus stop on the northern island of Ruegen, Elsa the tiger has found a new home on the mainland at an animal park in the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. A lion and a tiger have already been raised in our house. The animals are like family members to us, said Saad Rose, who runs the park together with his wife, Monica Farell. Elsa, a Siberian tiger, isn t without company. Thirteen other tigers and five lions live at the facility in the Baltic Sea town of Dassow. It s a full-time job, like looking after a baby, Farell said. In March, Elsa is set to move out of her bedroom in the couple s home and into an enclosure in the park. Siberian tigers are the largest of the world s big cats, weighing about 200kg and measuring over two metres in length. Today, there are more tigers in captivity than in the wild.
