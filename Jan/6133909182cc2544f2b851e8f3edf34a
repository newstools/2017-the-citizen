Bolani&#8217;s life has piqued the interest of the public after she took the ANC to court in a bid to force them to pay her R2,3 million for work she did during a &#8216;war room&#8217; project. This &#8216;war room&#8217; was set up with the knowledge of ANC general manager Ignatius Jacobs to use social media influencers and distribute fake EFF and DA posters to discredit those parties in last year&#8217;s local government elections. Bolani&#8217;s court papers had minute details of the war room and implicated Shaka Sisulu as the master mind behind the project. Sisulu has admitted to working with Bolani but denied the &#8216;war room&#8217; was a propaganda machine.
