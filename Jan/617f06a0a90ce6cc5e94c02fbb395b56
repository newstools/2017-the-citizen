An accountant, accused of embezzling R 8,469,666 from her employer, made her fourth appearance in court on Monday. Jennifer Elizabeth Philander, 52, appeared in the Specialised Commercial Crime Court, before magistrate Sabrina Sonnenberg, who warned her to appear again on February 14. She faces charges of fraud and money laundering, committed over a period of 10 years, between September 2005 and October 2015. In July last year, prosecutor Juan Agulhas told the court that defence attorney Elroy Adams was in the process of negotiating a plea bargain with the State. In Monday s proceedings, the case was in the hands of a different prosecutor, Jannie Knipe, and attorney Adams was no longer on record for her. No mention was made on Monday of any plea bargain negotiations. This time, she was represented by legal aid lawyer Harley Cloete, who needed time to consult with her. At Cloete s request, the case was postponed to February 14. According to the charge sheet, Philander held the post of financial controller for 18 years, with her former employer. Her duties included the payment of creditors, control of the cashbook and the addition and modification of creditors in the company s banking system. It is alleged that she captured various suppliers in the incorrect accounting months, and manipulated the system to channel funds into her own personal bank account, for luxuries for herself and her family. -African News Agency For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
