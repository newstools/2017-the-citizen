Hip hop artist Molemo &#8220;Jub Jub&#8221; Maarohanye has released a new rap track, &#8220;Ke Kopa Tshwarelo&#8221; (Please Forgive Me), which talks of how sorry he is, in Setswana and English. The track features Afro-jazz legend Tsepo Tshola, and is a musical apology for the reason he spent more than four years behind bars with Themba Tshabalala after a drag race went horribly wrong and they ploughed into a group of schoolkids, killing four and leaving two others brain damaged. Jub Jub apparently wrote his song while inside Leeuwkop Correctional Centre in Johannesburg. Have a listen to the song below:
