This man had no idea what was in store for him after he allegedly refused to pay for service and assaulted a petrol attendant at a filling station in Namibia over the festive season. In a video recently posted by EFF national spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi, petrol attendants can be seen hitting a man who was travelling in a black car with a baseball bat and what looks like a sjambok. &#8220;In festive season, weekends or after big rugby games, in rural small towns, black people know that drunk white farm boys will also be engaging in a festivity of anti-black racist assaults &amp; authorities can&#8217;t police it! &#8220;The phenomenon of Drunk White Males randomly beating up blacks in small towns is normalized &amp; never makes it in police records in this country. &#8220;In Windhoek, Namibia, a drunk white man refused to pay for service, insulted &amp; clapped a petrol attendant; this is what they did to him,&#8221; said Ndlozi of the video, which sparked a debate about whether or not the actions of the petrol attendants were right. While some said it was not right for the attendant to hit the man like that, others said he deserved the beating.

If it was not for Metro cops I would have been a dead girl that day. So yes, those petrol attendants had every right to do what they did. &#8220;You see sir, it&#8217;s not even the physical assault that hurts, it&#8217;s the psychological impact these attacks have on a human being. Trust, I hate violence but sometimes violent racist people can only understand that we are not inferior to them through the language of being violated themselves. Having been a victim myself I applaud these guys. &#8220;Ask my cousin @hanyanimakumbani what horrible things they did to him at a gas station. He&#8217;s lucky to be alive. Big ups to these guys! It&#8217;s about damn time too.&#8221; Watch the video below: In festive season, weekends or after big rugby games, in rural small towns black people know that drunk white farm boys will also be engaging in a festivity of anti-black racist assaults &amp; authorities can&#8217;t police it!
