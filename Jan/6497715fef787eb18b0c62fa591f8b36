The Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) has on Wednesday appointed investigators after four school children were killed in a road crash in Ntuzuma, Durban. The accident happened when a minibus collided with a bus resulting in the death of four children, who died at the scene. One child is in serious condition while 16 suffered slight to moderate injuries. It has been alleged that the minibus driver had sped off from the local taxi rank after having been stopped by the rank manager for overloading inspections. RTMC said it has appointed a team of investigators in KwaZulu-Natal to assist with investigations into the incident. The crash represent a major setback on efforts to improve road safety. Of particular concern is the allegedly rogue attitude displayed by the minibus driver moments before the crash, the RTMC said. RTMC calls on taxi associations to demonstrate their true commitment to road safety by dealing decisively with the driver of the minibus and its owners. It is not acceptable for associations to keep quiet when tragedies of this nature take place, said the RTMC. It called on the traffic law enforcement authorities to extend their zero-tolerance enforcement to all vehicles transporting school children. Our children deserve to be transported in vehicles that are safe to be on the roads and by well-behaved drivers who respect the rules of the roads. Unsafe vehicles should be immediately impounded. RTMC conveyed its condolences to the families, and friends and teachers of the deceased children.
