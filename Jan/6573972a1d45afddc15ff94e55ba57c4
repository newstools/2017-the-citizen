Lundi is sadly no longer with us. His life kept his fans entertained and in awe of his great talent. We take a look at the most fascinating aspects of the Worcester-born singer&#8217;s life. Lundi was a father to son Sibonello and daughter Bella, both of whom are in their teens. Speaking to Move magazine, Lundi said he wanted to set a good example for them. He said he had moved on from all the gossip because it had a stressful effect on his life. &#8220;I&#8217;m an orphan and raising my two beautiful children who are in their teens &#8230; I&#8217;m trying to set a good example for them.

I have experienced enough darkness in my life and I won&#8217;t allow the media to make a public spectacle of my life any more,&#8221; he said. Lundi had returned from a trip to China when he fell ill in December last year. He had been busy staging a comeback after the release of his DVD, The Best of Lundi Chapter 7. Since he broke into the gospel scene at 21, Lundi&#8217;s life had been under the spotlight. He lost both parents and hogged headlines for all the wrong reasons. He was dogged by rumours of his sexuality. Though he declined to speak about his preferences, he did say last year that it was not anyone&#8217;s business. &#8220;Whether I am gay or straight is not for anyone to know. I&#8217;m too old to talk about such things in public. &#8220;What I get up to behind closed doors is for me and not the media. People have written so many things about me as if they know me,&#8221; he said. A clip from Lundi&#8217;s DVD below: With fame came the pressure of drugs and alcohol. Lundi had turned away from that lifestyle, coming clean about battling debilitating addiction. He said he went public about his struggle, as other stars such as Kabelo Mabalane have done, because he needed help. He put his past behind him and became focused on his gospel career. While shooting a reality TV show with e.tv, Lundi said he had also beat alcoholism. &#8220;I used to drink for years. I would just change drinking spots until the media eventually caught on to my bad habit. I now attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings to make me stronger and I stay informed to avoid a relapse. &#8220;I have moved on from that life.&#8221; Lundi began his music career in 1998, releasing his first album Mphefumulo Wami. He won a Kora award for best gospel in 2003 and a South African Music Award, taking the best African Traditional Gospel category in 2008 . Lundi was mentored by gospel legend Rebecca Malope. He sang backup vocals for her until he caught the eye of Tshepo Nzimande, who offered him his first record deal 19 years ago.
