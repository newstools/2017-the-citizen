A two-year-old boy is in critical condition after he was found floating in an Athlone Park swimming pool, in KwaZulu-Natal on Thursday. Reports from the scene indicate the father found the two-year-old-boy floating in the water at about 11.20am, said Netcare 911 media liaison officer Chris Botha. Paramedics found the child in a critical condition with shallow breathing after his father had resuscitated him. Paramedics treated the child and ventilated him en route to a nearby hospital where a medical team was standing by to continue medical treatment. This was the fourth two-year-old to fall into a swimming pool this holiday season, said Botha. Children disappear very quickly from your sight and, for this reason, we advise people to cover the swimming pool with an SABS-approved net, or to fence in the pool to prevent such a tragedy. &#8211; Caxton News Service For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
