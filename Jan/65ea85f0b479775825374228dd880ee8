President Jacob Zuma&#8217;s niece, Mabuyi Zuma, lost all her belongings as her thatched-roof hut caught fire after being struck by lightning during thunderstorms in the KwaNxamalala village, in Nkandla, on Tuesday. Mabuyi, whose father, Khanya, is the president&#8217;s younger brother, said she was alone in her rondavel when lighting struck her house at about 4.40pm. Her house was situated next to uncle Michael Zuma&#8217;s rondavels. News24 has reported that Mabuyi said she used a bucket full of water in an attempt to put out the fire. However, her efforts bore no fruit, as the roof was too high. She lost everything but her phone, as it was the closest thing to her, she told the publication. Firefighters were called to the scene, but there was nothing they could do, as &#8220;everything was burnt to the ground&#8221;. Mabuyi&#8217;s daughter, a Grade 5 learner, went to school without her uniform the following day. &nbsp;
