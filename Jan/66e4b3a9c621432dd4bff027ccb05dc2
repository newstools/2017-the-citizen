Limpopo police are looking for the suspects responsible for killing lions on a farm south of Polokwane earlier this week. Three lions were found killed, possibly through poisoning, at a farm outside Polokwane, Limpopo police said in a statement posted on the official South African Police Service (SAPS) Facebook page on Saturday. Two of the lions, both males, were found with their heads and paws removed. The third one, a female, was not dismembered. This latest incident is similar to the cases that were previously reported in Tzaneen, Mara, and Hoedspruit, the statement said. The motive was not known at this stage. Police investigations were continuing. Anybody with any information about the killings should please contact Captain Retief at 082-3199-460 or the nearest police station. Alternatively members of the public could contact Crime Stop anonymously at 08600-10111.
