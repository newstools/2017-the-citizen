Foreign minister of Chad Moussa Faki Mahamat will be replacing African Union Commission chairperson Dr Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma. This followed a vote by African heads of state and government on Monday afternoon during the African Union Summit in the Ethiopian capital. After the initial round of voting, only Mahamat and Kenya s Foreign Minister, Amina Mohamed, were left to contest the position, with Mahamat eventually emerging victorious. Six months ago, Dlamini-Zuma, who declined a second four-year term, had her tenure extended in Kigali, Rwanda, after elections to replace her were inconclusive. Dlamini-Zuma, an academic and politician, was the first woman to lead the 50-year-old organisation. At the weekend, South Africa Minister of International Relations and Cooperation Maite Nkoana-Mashabane said this time around, there would be no choice but to conclude the elections. Five candidates were vying for the post, including Mahamat, Senegal s Abdoulaye Bathily, a former UN special envoy for Central Africa, Botswana s Foreign Minister Pelonomi Venson-Moitoi, Equatorial Guinea s Foreign Minister Agapito Mba Mokuy and Kenya s Mohamed. In the months leading to the election, Mohamed had campaigned extensively in East Africa and was expected to be a formidable candidate, but Mahamat, who was considered an outside bet, beat her in the final vote.
