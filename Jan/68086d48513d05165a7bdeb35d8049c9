As the rest of South Africans were mourning the death of gospel legend Sfiso Ncwane at the Moses Mabhida Stadium in December last year, Durban street vendors saw a business opportunity they could not let slip. Some people took videos of the proceedings and are now selling them on the Durban streets for R10. The DVD s cover has images of artists who performed at the funeral, including Babes Wodumo and Mampintsha, even though the two did not perform. The SABC News logo is also featured on the cover. Is this entrepreneurship or disrespect to the Ncwane family? People are selling Sfiso Ncwane&#39;s funeral DVD for R10 on the streets pic.twitter.com/aEmaBVVXv4 &mdash; I Love Mornings (@ILoveMornings) January 10, 2017 Ncwane Communications spokesperson Asanda Mpais released a statement saying the family was not aware of the DVDs. It is painful and disappointing that some people would try to make money in the form of a difficult experience the Ncwane family went through. Can people also please show respect by not buying the DVDs, and, if they can, could they rather show us where they are being sold so we can report this, reads the statement. According to a statement from the Ncwane family, the Kulungile Baba hit maker died on December 5 in Fourways Life hospital after a short illness. The illness started the day before he passed at his Johannesburg home. He was then taken to hospital, where he was admitted and diagnosed with kidney failure and later moved to the intensive care unit. He unfortunately took his last breath at 9.30am Monday morning in the presence and arms of his loving wife Ayanda Ncwane. He was laid to rest at Heroes Acre in Chesterville in KwaZulu-Natal.
