Social media has reacted on Monday morning to a banner hanging off a bridge between the N1&#8217;s William Nicol and Rivonia off-ramps. Whoever had hung it had turned the FNB abbreviation into &#8220;Flippin Negligent Bankers&#8221;. It&#8217;s not known who is responsible for the stunt, which also changed the bank&#8217;s logo into a tree with an AK-47 in the branches. Saw a banner on the N1 N between William Nicol and Rivonia off ramps which reads &quot;FNB: Flippen Negligent Bankers.&quot; Someone&#39;s upset! &mdash; Mabale Moloi (@MabaleMoloi) January 9, 2017 The bank has been subject to a lot of anger from some of its customers recently after it allegedly failed to communicate with them when their valuable and cash were stolen from safety-deposit boxes. More than 200 deposit boxes were stolen on December 23 and more than R1.7 million was also stolen in a robbery at the Parktown branch. The bank&#8217;s alleged silence on customer losses has caused great dissatisfaction among customers, who have alleged that they may be suffering some of these losses on their own and that the bank did not tell them what had happened. Some of them have lost objects of sentimental value or irreplaceable jewellery/family heirlooms. The AK-47 addition in the acacia logo would suggest that whoever hung the banner was affected by the robberies. Twitter has also reacted: #FNB flippen negligent bankers.
