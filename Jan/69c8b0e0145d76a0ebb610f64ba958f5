While the performance in Civics, History, Geography, Kiswahili, Physics, Chemistry, Biology and Basic Mathematics subjects witnessed an improvement in FTSEE 2016 exams when compared with the 2015 results, the performance of English dropped when compared with those of 2015, Dr Msonde said.The results for SFNA showed that pupils performed well in the subjects of Stadi za Kazi (Life Skills), Haiba and Michezo (Personality and Sports) with 94.67 per cent while they their performance in English generally fell as only 72.51 per cent passed.Cancellation of resultsNecta cancelled the results of 31 FTSEE and 58 SFNA examinees respectively after they were caught cheating during examinations.According to Dr Msonde, the decision was reached based on Section 36 (2) (b) of the Examinations Regulations, 2015, whereby the said candidates will have to repeat the class and write new exams this year.Also, Dr Msonde urged all respective authorities to take disciplinary action against anyone who, in one way or another, had a role in cheating during the exams.He said the authorities should apply the relevant laws guiding such conduct.More efforts on science subjects neededThe FTSEE results show that the performance in Basic Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry were below the average comparing with those of Civics, History, Geography, Kiswahili, English and Biology. Deliberate efforts are thus required to be taken in order to raise the performance in these subjects, said Dr Msonde.
