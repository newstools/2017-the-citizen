Cricket South Africa (CSA) are adamant AB de Villiers isn&#8217;t bigger than the Proteas and can&#8217;t choose when he plays Test cricket. Instead, CSA chief executive Haroon Lorgat intimated that South Africa&#8217;s one-day captain has been given an ultimatum: he either plays continuously or stays out. Also read: AB de Villiers, unconvincingly, says he&#8217;s not giving up Tests De Villiers on Tuesday made himself unavailable for the Tests against New Zealand next month but will be captain in the upcoming one-day series against Sri Lanka. The brilliant middle-order batter has been out of competitive cricket since June last year due to an elbow injury. &#8220;This is a plan that we had six months ago. It&#8217;s just a case of when he starts or when he returns,&#8221; said Lorgat. &#8220;Because once he starts playing Tests again, there&#8217;s no stopping and no time off. When you play, you play continuously. So he&#8217;s not picking and choosing. These are deliberate discussions that we&#8217;re having and which will continue.&#8221; As a result, CSA are also not surprised by his decision to opt out of the New Zealand Tests. &#8220;ODI cricket is the focus because he&#8217;s the captain. Test cricket is different. We&#8217;ve got a settled team, we&#8217;ve got the resources to go through,&#8221; said Lorgat. &#8220;I&#8217;m most satisfied by the kind of conversations we&#8217;re having with him,&#8221; Lorgat said. &#8220;He&#8217;s clear about when he&#8217;s going to be ready and when he&#8217;s not ready. His clarity is important because then selectors are aware and we move on. His absence has allowed us to build a team without him.&#8221; If De Villiers plans on returning for the high-profile Test series in England in mid-year, he&#8217;s in for a bit of a surprise. &#8220;If the selectors and the team feel that they have a winning team going, AB is fully aware that it&#8217;s the selectors that will determine whether he comes back into the team or not,&#8221; said Lorgat.
