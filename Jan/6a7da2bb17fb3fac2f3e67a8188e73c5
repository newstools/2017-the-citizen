Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu downplayed a spat with Mexico over US President Donald Trump&#8217;s proposed border wall Tuesday, saying the countries&#8217; relations were stronger than a &#8220;passing&#8221; row. Netanyahu wrote on Twitter that Israel &#8220;will continue to have good relations&#8221; with Mexico. &#8220;I believe our ties are stronger than any passing disagreement or misunderstanding,&#8221; he added. Mexico demanded an apology after Netanyahu tweeted last week in support of Trump&#8217;s proposed wall spanning the Mexican border, saying a similar plan along Israel&#8217;s southern frontier had been a success. Netanyahu did not apologise, saying he did not comment on US-Mexico relations in the original tweet. But he said he had a &#8220;long, fruitful and very friendly relationship&#8221; with Mexico&#8217;s President Enrique Pena Nieto. Israel&#8217;s President Reuven Rivlin will speak with Pena Nieto on Tuesday, a source close to him said, as the two countries seek to calm the row. Rivlin, who comes from Netanyahu&#8217;s Likud party, is expected to stress the importance of the relationship between the two countries, the source said on condition of anonymity. Pena Nieto cancelled a planned meeting with Trump over the proposed wall. 1994-2017 Agence France-Presse
