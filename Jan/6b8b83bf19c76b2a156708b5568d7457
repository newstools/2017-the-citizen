The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) will hold a four-day strategy meeting next week and among others, it will discuss forming the party&#8217;s youth wing. Responding to an EFF member who asked the party&#8217;s national chairperson, Advocate Dali Mpofu, to form a youth wing of the party, Mpofu said a timeline was likely to be determined at the said meeting. Mpofu&#8217;s comment left some wondering if the party should form a youth league when it was itself &#8220;a youth league&#8221;. &#8220;I&#8217;m rather suggesting that you give political education because we are already a youthful movement,&#8221; said one Twitter user. Those who agreed with the party&#8217;s plan advised the national chairperson to rather wait as the party was still new. It&#39;s on the cards&#8230;timeline is likely to be determined at our 4 day strategy meeting next week! https://t.co/nltgpZPEfx &mdash; Dali Mpofu (@AdvDali_Mpofu) January 12, 2017 Should the party decide to form a women&#8217;s league, poet Ntsiki Mazwai has already asked to lead it. Taking to Twitter recently, Mazwai tweeted EFF CIC Julius Malema and said that if the ANC pushed for Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, she would like to head up the EFF Women s League . Mazwai, along with other female leaders in the EFF would give the women s league of the failed movement a good run , and ultimately win elections, said one of her followers.
