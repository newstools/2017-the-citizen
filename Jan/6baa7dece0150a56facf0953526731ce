Keeping the SA flag flying at the Australian Open, Raven Klaasen has reached the mixed doubles quarter-finals. The veteran South African joined Dutch partner Michaella Krajicek in securing a 6-4 6-4 victory over Robert Linstedt of Sweden and Raquel Atawo of the United States in their second-round clash on Tuesday. They were set to meet Juan Sebastian Cabal of Colombia and American Abigail Spears in their last-eight fixture, in search of a place in the semifinals. By progressing with Krajicek, Klaasen reached the quarter-finals at Melbourne Park for the third time in four years. He also made it to the last eight in the men&#8217;s doubles in 2014, when he reached the final with former partner Eric Butorac, and again last season.
