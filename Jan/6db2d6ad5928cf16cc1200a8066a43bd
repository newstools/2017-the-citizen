A 58-year-old man appeared in the Bronkhorspruit District Court on Thursday and was granted R5 000 bail on charges of fraud and corruption, the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (the Hawks) in Mpumalanga said. Hawks spokesperson Captain Dineo Lucy Sekgotodi said Lucas Matthys Neetling allegedly attempted to con an Emalahleni businessman out of R100 000 by pretending to be a close friend of Mpumalanga MEC for human settlement and MEC for community safety, security and liaison. The man claims to be having access to tenders for construction of RDP houses as well as bridges. Little did he know that the businessman he was about to be con was actually a brother of the MEC for Community Safety, Security and Liaison, Sekgotodi said. Mpumalanga Hawks Serious Corruption Investigations were notified and sting operation conducted leading to the arrest of the suspect on Tuesday 24th January 2017. The suspect was found to be jobless and going around pretending to be a director of an architectural company and consultancy services but all is propaganda. The case was postponed to March 9.
