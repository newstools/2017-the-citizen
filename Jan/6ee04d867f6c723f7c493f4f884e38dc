Lions coach Johan Ackermann distanced himself in no uncertain terms from a reported link to a top French rugby club which was said to be after his services. Reports at the weekend suggested Ackermann s signature is in high demand overseas after the success he has achieved with the Lions over the last few seasons. I am definitely not sure what sort of overseas post is being referred to, Ackermann said. Unfortunately I don t read newspapers so I m not certain of (the report s) origin and therefore can t react on what stands in the specific article. Meanwhile, Ackermann was expected to call on more of his experienced stars for this weekend s Barbarians warm-up match after a young Lions side, made up mostly of junior and Under-21 players, went down 38-17 to the Bulls in Harare at the weekend. In the other warm-up game in the Zimbabwean capital, the Stormers brushed Currie Cup champions Cheetahs aside, scoring seven tries for a 43-7 victory, with the Cheetahs crossing the whitewash just once.
