The case against a man who posted a racist rant on Facebook over Diwali celebrations was postponed in the Durban Magistrates Court on Tuesday. Johannes David &#8216;Dawie&#8217; Kriel faces a charge of crimen injuria for sending the social media post. The case against him was postponed by Magistrate Themba Sishi to allow Kriel s newly appointed attorney, Logan Padayachee, to prepare a statement for pleading. At a previous court appearance, Kriel told the court he intended pleading guilty. The matter was postponed to January 27. The courtroom was packed with supporters of the Democratic Alliance and the African National Congress. Outside the court building, about 80 members of both parties danced and waved placards denouncing Kriel and racism. Every year, Diwali fireworks celebrations in Durban become a major bone of contention between animal lovers and those who celebrate Diwali with fireworks. Diwali is the Hindu festival of lights, which for believers spiritually signifies the victory of light over darkness, good over evil, knowledge over ignorance, and hope over despair.
