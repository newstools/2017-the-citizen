South Africa&#8217;s crippling drought affects everyone &#8211; including one of the country&#8217;s prominent sport stars. Dewald Potgieter, a former Springbok flanker who nowadays plays for Worcester in England, on Monday evening revealed his farm in Willowmore in the Eastern Cape received rain for the first time in half a year! 2017 brings with it the first bit of rain the farm has seen in over half a year. It&#39;s one of the most grateful pieces of earth, and so, despite what it looks like now, in a few days the brown soil will be transformed into something on which life can flourish. It&#39;s brilliant.
