Ahead of his appearance at the Limpopo High Court in Polokwane today, Lethebo Detective Rabalago, of Mount Zion General Assembly, says he is not afraid of jail. In fact, the Doom Prophet dared law enforcement to arrest him, saying jail would not stop him from performing miracles. He further told The Sowetan he believed God could make him disappear from the jail cells. Rabalago is expected to convince the court today that an interdict by the provincial health department, ordering him to stop using Doom, should not be made final. The interdict, however, does not seem to bother him, as he said he had a &#8220;strong&#8221; legal team and expected people to show him support in court. He has promised to be even more outrageous this year &#8220;as long as God permits&#8221;.

The prophet sprayed doom on her, and she received her healing and deliverance [sic], one of the church s Facebook posts read. When asked why he would use Doom to heal people, Rabalago said he was chosen before birth to do it. Following a public outcry over his actions, he responded by demonstrating the power of God and posted pictures of himself spraying the insect killer in his own face. The Man of God, Prophet Lethebo, demonstrated the Power of God by himself. By putting in his eyes and on the the face of his skin also the mouth. He is giving you answers. We are born of the spirit, read the caption on the pictures. Read more: Doom prophet Dooms himself to show God s power &nbsp; &nbsp;
