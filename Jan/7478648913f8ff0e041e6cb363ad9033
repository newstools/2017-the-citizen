A woman and her lover briefly appeared in the Moretele Magistrates&#8217; Court in Hammanskraal on Monday, for allegedly killing her husband and burying him in the bush in Bosplaas. Fikile Mongwe, 36, who appeared with co-accused Innocent Pilosa, 21, are charged with murdering Selaelo Lekalakala, a government employee who was set to retire this year. Mongwe had recently married Lekalakala after having worked for him as a housekeeper following the death of his wife in 2014. Police said the 61-year-old was murdered on December 30, 2016, and his wife reported him missing on January 16. Police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele said an accomplice who only took part in the concealment of the body approached the police to reveal the mystery behind Lekalakala s disappearance. He told police that the wife s boyfriend, who is also his friend, had called him on December 31, asking him to help him carry a load of rubbish to the bush. He helped the couple carry the body at night, which was wrapped in a blanket and stuffed in a big tub. They dug a hole but it was too shallow and left the body there and returned the next evening to dig a deeper hole. The accomplice, who has turned State witness, told police he realised on the second night that they were actually burying a body. The matter was postponed to February 16, for bail application.
