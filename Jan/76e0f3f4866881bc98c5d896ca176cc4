The 20-year-old defender &#8212; who a week ago was facing life on the dole queue after being made redundant by luxury carmakers Bentley &#8212; will first be tried out in the Under-23 side. However, Wenger &#8212; who was impressed by his trial period and persuaded Arsenal to pay Hednesford Town 40,000 (46,000 euros, $48,500) &#8212; said he would have to prove he could challenge for a first team place pretty quickly. &#8220;First he has to show at youth level that he can quickly make the first team,&#8221; Wenger told the club website. Overall I believe he has fantastic physical qualities, he has a good level of motivation because he has gone down and come up again. &#8220;He has to prepare, to challenge the first-team players as quickly as he can. That could be in a very short period of time. &#8220;He has the ingredients: the timing of his runs is very good, he has decent technique and exceptional pace. These are very important ingredients today. &#8220;He was an athlete before and he came late to the game and that s why I believe in him. &#8220;Can he manage the tactical aspect and the technical aspect? Physically, he will be top level.
