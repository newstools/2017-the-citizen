Dar es Salaam. District Council directors have been urged to set aside funds for the construction of libraries to ensure the provision of quality education.The directive was issued on Friday by acting commissioner in the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology Nicolas Burreta.Mr Buretta was speaking during the launch of a renovated library at Pugu Secondary School, which was funded by Sahara Tanzania Foundation.The latter also disbursed Sh30 million for buying 2,000 textbooks and supporting training for 15 teachers on how to manage the library. Libraries are very important in schools. I call upon district councils to set aside funds for construction of these facilities, especially in secondary schools, said Mr Buretta.He noted that for Tanzania to become an industrialised and middle income country, it should have competent graduates. He hinted that qualified teachers and a conducive learning environment were of utmost importance in attaining the 2025 development goals. Head of Sahara Tanzania Foundation Babatomiwa Adesida said the assistance was part of the firm s corporate social responsibility.Pugu Secondary School Headmaster Jouvinus Mutabuzi commended the Sahara Tanzania Foundation for support.He said the renovation had come at the right time because the school lacked basic learning materials, which were important for an enabling learning environment.
