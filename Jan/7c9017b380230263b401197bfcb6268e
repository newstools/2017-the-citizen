Meet Weza Matomane, the guy you hear on your television screens every day but never get to see. Matomane grew up in Vanderbijlpark but is currently based in Pretoria. He was profiled by Destiny Man magazine&#8217;s &#8216;Power of 40&#8242; and came 23rd last year. According to the profile, he is a chairperson and co-founder of Black Science Technology and Engineering Professionals&#8217; Society since 2011. The society was involved in outreach work, doing motivational talks at township schools around Pretoria. Matomane can fluently speak four languages: IsiXhosa, Sesotho, Afrikaans and English. He is currently a DJ and radio presenter at Cliff Central and has been there since 2014. He is also an executive director at WTG Media House and an MC for Destiny Man events. Perhaps what is more interesting about Matomane is that he is the guy behind that voice telling you all Shoprite&#8217;s &#8220;lowest&#8221; prices. He also voices Mzansi Magic&#8217;s weekend line-ups and movie trailers. Watch some of the videos he recently posted of himself on the job: Just did a voice over for Shoprite &#x1f60a; #LiveYourDream A video posted by Weza Matomane (@wezathatguy) on Jan 16, 2017 at 12:32am PST Doing the thing that makes the other things to be done #liveyourdream A video posted by Weza Matomane (@wezathatguy) on Jan 4, 2017 at 12:44pm PST Another voice over for the day #WeAintDoneYet #LiveYourDream #AnotherOne A video posted by Weza Matomane (@wezathatguy) on Dec 20, 2016 at 2:01am PST At least we know now who has been sending us to buy food at Shoprite all this time.
