Just when you thought the deafening static of disharmony emanating from where the twin towers dominate the lower reaches of the Auckland Park headquarters of the SABC in the north-western suburbs of Johannesburg had reached a crescendo, we are told of the process to be employed in finding a new board for the public broadcaster. As we understand it, the new board who will fill the chairs vacated by the former bosses, a panel ousted by parliamentary disfavour and public opprobrium, is seen as a quick fix to a problem which has been festering for years. It is interesting that the key phrases for the appointment of any incoming five-member board centre on its temporary nature and that consensus will be the criterion in selecting candidates. Finding consensus on any aspect of the SABC is, we would suggest, a novel principle judged against recent history. The interim nature of the board, which will hold sway for not more than six months, stems directly from this reliance on the majority of hands involved in the selection process dialing into the same wavelength. Then, as you would imagine, the real work of sifting through suitable permanent candidates and interviews must be undertaken. This one, we suspect, will run and run.
