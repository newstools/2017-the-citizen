The South African Weather Service on Friday issued a warning for heavy rains and possible flooding in central and southern parts of Gauteng. Weather service spokesperson Mabitjela Thema said there were heavy rains expected in Johannesburg and Pretoria as the day progressed. People should expect heavy rains, leading to localised floods in and around Johannesburg, Thema said. In November, heavy rains caused flash flooding in many part of Johannesburg, which left at least six people dead, while also leading to the collapse of buildings and seeing roads and vehicles submerged.
