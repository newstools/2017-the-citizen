You can&#8217;t blame [a pastor] on the teachings of the Bible.&#8221; Speaking to Sowetan, Mboro said the teachings of the Bible could not be ignored and that pastors were merely following God&#8217;s commandments by preaching on homosexuality being a sin. He was responding to the furore caused when celebrity choreographer Somizi posted several videos on his Instagram page fuming over how he was subjected to a sermon by a pastor at the Grace Bible Church in Soweto about being gay and how that was not in line with biblical standards. &#8220;I accept anyone, whether gay or lesbian. God loves us all, whether we are right or wrong. He wants all people to repent and come to him.

Grace Bible church has since issued a statement that they stand by the pastor who gave the sermon and that homosexuality was not the only sin being preached about.
