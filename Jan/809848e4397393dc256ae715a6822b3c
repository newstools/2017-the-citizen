The Proteas&#8217; quest to become the best Test side in the world again won&#8217;t be measured according to the official team rankings. Despite climbing to third following the weekend&#8217;s 3-0 whitewash of Sri Lanka at the Wanderers, the South Africans won&#8217;t be able to catch top-ranked India anytime soon.

As a result, South Africa rather just want to gauge their progress by performing consistently in their next few series &#8211; away to New Zealand and England. &#8220;We&#8217;re definitely goal-orientated at the moment,&#8221; said Russell Domingo, the Proteas coach. &#8220;You can&#8217;t look too much into the rankings at the moment. Naturally, we want to get back to the top but it won&#8217;t happen quickly. India are currently the best in the world and still have to play a few series at home. &#8220;All we can do it continue to win series in future and the rankings will take care of itself.&#8221; Faf du Plessis, South Africa&#8217;s captain, hailed his side&#8217;s &#8220;consistency&#8221; in the series and also pointed to the fact that they dominated &#8220;95% of time&#8221;. The results certainly back him up &#8211; the winning margins increased as the series went on, culminating in the weekend&#8217;s massive victory by an innings and 118 runs. Yet Domingo is far more diplomatic, stating &#8220;there is still big room for improvement&#8221;. Generally, the Proteas&#8217; bowling attack was ruthlessly consistent but the batting only fired in fits and starts.

What&#8217;s happened is that one guy gets a ton, then another guy gets one and then another one. There hasn&#8217;t been one batter that made a few big scores in succession. &#8220;I want more players scoring 500 runs in one series.&#8221; Duanne Olivier and Wayne Parnell, the newbies in a revamped attack, took 11 wickets between themselves at the Bullring but Domingo admits they still need to strike the right balance. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have to decide which of those two is the most suitable for our demands.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
