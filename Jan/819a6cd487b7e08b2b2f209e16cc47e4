EFF leader Julius Malema tweeted on Friday that he had personally spoken to gospel star Lundi Tyamara and &#8220;he&#8217;s recovering from his hospital bed. I&#8217;m happy he&#8217;s responding very well &amp;will be out soon.&#8221; Just spoke to our undisputed Gospel star Lundi &amp; he&#39;s recovering from his hospital bed.I&#39;m happy he&#39;s responding very well &amp;will be out soon &mdash; Julius Sello Malema (@Julius_S_Malema) January 6, 2017 It had earlier been reported that Lundi was discharged from hospital last weekend and was recovering at home. Drum magazine had also broken the news of his ill-health after reporting that it spoke to several reliable sources, who told them that Lundi had abdominal tuberculosis, along with chest pains and a liver problem. A second source reportedly said he also had breathing problems. They said he would probably not be able to perform for some time. Lundi has been a solo singer since 1998 with a string of gospel hits to his name. He has often made the headlines more for his personal life and sexual orientation, however. One of his friends told the Sowetan: His situation was bad. He was first admitted at Edenvale Hospital. He was then transferred to Charlotte Maxeke and spent days there. He was then transferred back to Edenvale Hospital and was discharged this past weekend. Lundi&#8217;s manager, Anele Hlazo, has rubbished claims made by one website that Lundi had died. He told TimesLive on Friday: &#8220;He is not dead. He is still in hospital, I went to see him this morning and will go back again at 3pm.&#8221;
