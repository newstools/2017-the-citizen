House DJ Nkosinathi &#8220;Black Coffee&#8221; Maphumulo was called &#8220;legendary&#8221; by EFF MP Mbuyiseni Ndlozi on Monday. This after he managed to have political enemies EFF leader Julius Malema and ANC MP Fikile Mbalula take a picture together. In the picture, which included Ndlozi, ANC spokesperson Zizi Kodwa, musician Oskido and Black Coffee, the thought-to-be political enemies were all smiles together. At one stage they were ANC comrades and friends, with Malema having taken over the presidency of the ANC Youth League from Mbaks. &#8220; Isn&#8217;t being a legend the ability to bring together what would ordinarily not come together? This makes @RealBlackCoffee&#8217;s wedding legendary,&#8221; wrote Ndlozi. This all happened at the wedding of Coffee and his wife, Mbali Mlotshwa, who celebrated their nuptials in a glamorous white wedding at Sun City on Sunday. Former Generations actor Sophie Ndaba is said to have planned the wedding. Ndaba was also a witness when the two made their union official on Friday at their house. The couple got married traditionally at Mlotshwa s house in Soweto in 2011. They then signed the official paperwork on Friday, with Oskido and Ndaba as witnesses. Oskido said that Coffee pulled surprise yomhlaba on me. A casual visit to his house, I witness a union of two beautiful spirits. May your hearts be always near both in good and bad times. May you always hold on to each other with trust and faith. Wishing you a blissfully married life! @realblackcoffee @enhlembali_ officially you are now one congrats #marriage #wedding #ibelieve, he wrote on Instagram.
