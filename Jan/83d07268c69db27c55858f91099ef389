Lungi Ngidi received his &#8220;unexpected&#8221; call-up to Proteas T20 squad because he&#8217;s a good listener. And if anyone doubts that, they merely need to hear what the 20-year-old quick from the Titans did when Linda Zondi, the national selection convenor, gave him the news. Also read: From Ngidi to Smuts: Who are the Proteas T20 newbies? &#8220;We were in Bloemfontein for a four-day game that got rained out. I was under the covers in our hotel room when I got the call,&#8221; said Ngidi on Tuesday afternoon at the Wanderers, minutes before his first training session with the national side. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t quite believe what I was hearing at first. In fact, I checked the call logs on my phone a few times, just to make sure it actually happened. &#8220;Linda told me not to tell anyone before the squad gets announced, so I was just sitting around with a big smile. My roommate, Gregory (Mahlokwana) asked me why I was smiling but I told him: &#8216;Nah, nothing&#8217;. After all, I was asked not to say anything.&#8221; Jokes aside, Ngidi truly does believe he&#8217;s been given this early opportunity because he heeds the advice of his coaches. &#8220;The journey has been amazing, things unfolded really quickly,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I put in a few good performances this year but my coaches reminded me that nothing is a better recipe for success than consistency. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve tried to. I do things one step at a time.&#8221; One of the youngster&#8217;s greatest attributes is his ability to thrive being thrown at the deep end. Ngidi achieved the rare distinction of playing franchise cricket before appearing in the lower semi-professional provincial competition. &#8220;(Former Proteas assistant) Rob Walter was the guy that gave me my big break. I was playing Varsity Cricket with Tuks and he saw me. It really kick-started things for me,&#8221; he said. Naturally, the step up to international cricket can&#8217;t really be compared to a quick franchise selection but the basic attitude remains. &#8220;I think I&#8217;m adjusting quite well,&#8221; said Ngidi. &#8220;A lot of my Titans teammates are Proteas, so I have a pretty good idea of what&#8217;s required and how to go about it. Sometimes it&#8217;s better to be fast-tracked. I respond to it because I like to learn.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
