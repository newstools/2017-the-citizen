Three people were injured, one of them critically, when a car smashed into the back of a truck in Market Street in Pietermaritzburg early on Sunday morning. ER24 paramedics, along with another service, arrived on the scene to find the truck in the emergency lane while the car had come to a stop in the slow lane, ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring said. Upon closer inspection, paramedics found one man, the driver, laying trapped inside the vehicle. Two other passengers, a man and woman, were found seated in the rear of the vehicle. Rescue services had to use specialised rescue equipment to free the man from the car. The two passengers were also freed from the car. They were assessed by paramedics and the driver was found to be in a critical condition while the two passengers sustained moderate injuries. Paramedics treated the patients and provided the critically injured man with advanced life support interventions. Shortly after treatment the patients were transported to Northdale and Edendale Hospital for further treatment. The driver of the truck was assessed and found to have escaped injury, Meiring said.
