In yet another dramatic episode of Date My Family, one of the male candidates, Atang Letsoalo, has been accused of already being in a relationship with a woman named Dineo. In a series of tweets by InnoMatijane that have since been deleted, Letsoalo has apparently been dating Dineo for three years and she was pregnant with his child. &#8220;Atang bro, you&#8217;re in love with my friend, she&#8217;s pregnant with your baby now, you promised me you&#8217;ll do right by her now you&#8217;re on DMF WTF,&#8221; he said. According to Matijane, Dineo was crying throughout the whole episode as she watched her baby daddy going on a date with another woman. Her father allegedly has not spoken to her since she fell pregnant, as Letsoalo had not paid for damages. . Matijane further alleged that Letsoalo and the girl he went on a date with, Onthatile, already knew each other. In fact, she was the one Letsoalo was cheating on his pregnant girlfriend with.

Letsoalo took to social media to respond to the allegations, saying he went on the show for the experience. He further denied that he had impregnated someone, asking whoever was accusing him of doing so to double-check their information. &#8220;Hahahahaha eish I never ever thought in my life I would laugh the way I did in the early hours of today..

Date My Family is a show that sees a contestant visit the families of three potential dates. In the end, the contestant chooses one person to go on a blind date with, based on how well the family members sold the candidate.
