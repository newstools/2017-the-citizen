Former African National Congress (ANC) MP Vytjie Mentor has shared her thoughts on the ANC Women&#8217;s League&#8217;s Bathabile Dlamini&#8217;s alcohol-abuse allegations. In a series of Facebook posts, she let us in on what she and former ANC colleagues got up to after former president Thabo Mbeki&#8217;s second inauguration at the Union Buildings. She said she was sitting in the SAA Business Lounge when four woman MPs who were in the ANCWL&#8217;s uniform joined her. Understandably so, as they were all tired, three of the four MPs started drinking &#8220;some harder stuff&#8221;. Also read: Bathabile Dlamini addresses crowd while allegedly drunk &#8220;By the time our flight was called, one of them was very drunk and fell on the floor and threw up as well,&#8221; she said, without mentioning any names, though her story left many thinking she was talking about Dlamini. She further posted about Dlamini&#8217;s looks, though she removed the post, as followers slammed her for &#8220;making fun of someone&#8217;s looks&#8221;. &#8220;I fully agree that we should never ridicule any one for the way they look like [sic]. I also fully agree that we should never ridicule any medical condition of any one. I will never ridicule any one because they look different. &#8220;I will delete the status that is construed to be attacking somebody for the way they look like. I apologise for creating that impression. If what I wrote sounds like I am attacking how she looks like as a person, I am sorry,&#8221; she said. &#8220;If she is not using alcohol, what is she using then? SA needs an explanation?&#8221; Mentor wrote.
