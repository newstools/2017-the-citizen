The Proteas win by 282 runs and the series! 12.00: GONE! Finally some reward for Keshav Maharaj. Lovely, flighted delivery loops past Lahiru Kumara, who simply has to attack it. He misses and is stumped. SL 211/9. 11.51: Bit of resistance from Rangana Herath, who&#8217;s enjoying Keshav Maharaj&#8217;s spin. Sri Lanka at least go past 200. SL 202/8. 11.28: GONE! Vicious bouncer from Kagiso Rabada raps Suranga Lakmal on the gloves. That&#8217;s six for the brilliant quick! SL 178/8. 11.11: AND ANOTHER! That&#8217;s five for Kagiso Rabada! Extra bounce confounds Angelo Mathews, who only manages to get an edge. Sri Lanka now look hopeless. SL 166/7. 11.06: WICKET! Tharanga&#8217;s attacking intent is his downfall. Kagiso Rabada offers width but Tharanga doesn&#8217;t move his feet and gets a feather. SL 165/6. 10.58: Upul Tharanga shows his intent, driving Rabada skilfully for two boundaries. It takes the visitors past 150. SL 156/5. 10.54: OUT! Kagiso Rabada has broken the key stand. It&#8217;s not the most glamorous dismissal. Dinesh Chandimal clips an innocuous delivery straight to Stephen Cook at square leg. Another frustrating wicket for Sri Lanka. SL 144/5. 10.34: First over gone and Kyle Abbott has been on the money. He even induced an edge from Angelo Mathews that went to the vacant third man. SL 134/4. 10.25: There&#8217;s a bit of cloud cover in Cape Town on the fourth day. South Africa will hope to nip out Angelo Mathews and Dinesh Chandimal quickly as that will make their progress much easier. For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
