The Democratic Alliance (DA) on Friday said the death of award-winning Gospel star, Lundi Tyamara, was a loss to the South African music fraternity. Tyamara, 38, died just after midnight in the Edenvale Hospital, east of Johannesburg, following a battle with abdominal tuberculosis and a liver condition. We extend our deepest condolences to his family, friends and loved ones during this most difficult time. This is a huge loss to the South African music fraternity, DA national spokesperson Refiloe Nt sekhe said in a statement. The Mphefumlo Wam hitmaker enjoyed a very successful musical career spanning over two decades, and his music resonated with all South Africans, young and old. His long list of accolades include South African Music Awards, Crown Gospel Music Awards and the KORA awards. He sold over 3.7 million albums nationally. We will remember Lundi as a colourful character who enriched the local music industry with his inspirational music. Lala ngoxolo, Lundi. You will be sorely missed and your music will live on in the hearts of South Africans.
