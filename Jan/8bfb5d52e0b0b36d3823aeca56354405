The death toll in a collision between a minibus taxi and a bakkie on the N1 in Hammanskraal north of Pretoria on Saturday evening has risen from 12 to 16, Netcare 911 paramedics said. A total of 16 people were declared dead after a taxi and bakkie collided with each other on the N1 in Hammanskraal. Six of the deceased are children and 10 are adults, spokeswoman Athlenda Mathe said. There were only two survivors in this accident. One was in a critical condition while the other sustained moderate injuries. Both were stabilised on the scene and transported to hospitals in the area for further medical care. We can confirm that there is a total road closure on this route. Motorists are advised to use alternative routes or exercise patience. The road is still going to be closed for a few hours while authorities investigate what might have led to this accident. Also the bodies of the deceased are being moved to various mortuaries, so this might take some time. We are working alongside police and traffic authorities on [the] scene, Mathe said.
