Two people were seriously injured and two others sustained moderate injuries in a head-on collision on the R24 near the N14 crossing outside Krugersdorp on the West Rand on Saturday evening, paramedics said. Shortly before 6pm, paramedics from ER24 and local services arrived on the scene where they found the two cars a few metres apart, ER24 spokesman Werner Vermaak said. Both drivers sustained serious injuries which included leg fractures. Two passengers in a Citi Golf were treated for moderate injuries. Rescue equipment was used to free one of the trapped drivers from his vehicle before he could be transported to a nearby hospital. The circumstances surrounding the collision were not yet known. Local police attended the scene, Vermaak said.
