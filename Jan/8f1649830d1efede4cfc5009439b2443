The South African Democratic Teachers Union (Sadtu) on Monday warned that job cuts at the Technical, Vocational Education and Training Colleges (TVET) in KwaZulu-Natal would affect the quality of teaching and learning. The union said 136 lecturers and 36 support staff have already been served with letters telling them their jobs have been terminated. Although it s common knowledge that the number of employees in their staff establishment is informed by the number registered students, it remains unacceptable that one of these colleges, coastal college, surpassed all by shamelessly putting 102 employees out in the cold, the union said in a statement. ALSO READ: Markers concerned about not being compensated for exam scripts We remain disturbed by these figures, and we have all reasons to be suspicious as the Coastal College in under investigation for alleged mismanagement of finances. It cannot cut enrollment figures from 14 000 down to 9 000 while ironically the department has made available funding through [the National Financial Aid Scheme] Nsfas to the tune of R14 billion, part of which is earmarked for 200 000 TVET college students. The union further stated that the department of higher education and training had promised the TVET principals that their 2016/17 funding would be maintained in the 2017/2018 financial year. This then doesn t warrant any loss of jobs save in substitute posts where incumbents have returned. Sadtu said the management in these colleges should desist from irrationally cutting enrollment figures under the pretext of underfunding from the department. Sadtu shall defend the jobs of her members and to that end will call a special meeting with all affected workers for preparation of confrontation with the employers in this sector.
