The Eastern Cape Gang Investigation unit arrested a 24-year-old suspect within hours of a shooting incident in Port Elizabeth s gang-ridden northern areas. The arrest was one of 11 made by the unit in the past week. Police spokesperson Colonel Priscilla Naidu said it was alleged that a complainant heard gunshots fired outside her house in Bethelsdorp on Thursday afternoon. Naidu said a person unknown to the complainant then ran to the house. The suspects continued firing into the house from the outside. No one was injured, only damage to the property, said Naidu. The suspect is expected to appear in court on Monday on charges of attempted murder. Over the past week a total of 11 suspects allegedly involved in gang-related shootings have been arrested by the Provincial Gang Investigation Unit and the Visible Gang Intervention Team. Charges against the suspects include murder and attempted murder.
