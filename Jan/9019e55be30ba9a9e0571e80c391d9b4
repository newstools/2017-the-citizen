Two members of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) have been arrested following Sunday morning s planned land invasion in the White River/Hillsview area in Mpumalanga, reports the Lowvelder. The arrest of the duo emanates from a Facebook message that made rounds calling people from certain areas in the White River precinct to occupy land belonging to the Mbombela municipality, said police spokesperson Brigadier Leonard Hlathi. When analysed, the message bears connotations of criminal elements, he said. Subsequent to the message, a number of people took part in what Hlathi called an unlawful gathering at Plaston near White River . He added that they had been carrying some implements as allegedly directed. Meanwhile, the City of Mbombela Local Municipality had opened a criminal case at the Nelspruit Police Station. Hlathi explained that as a result of the case as well as the alleged actions of the political party leader, the police were bound to act within the prescripts of the law by making the arrests. The two men will appear in the Nelspruit Magistrate s Court tomorrow. They will face charges of trespassing, incitement to public violence and a charge depicted under the Gathering s Act. They will only be identified after they have appeared in court. Caxton News Service For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
