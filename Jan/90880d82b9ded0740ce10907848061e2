Rikhado Makhado, popularly known as Riky Rick, has recently blown up social media with a video of himself dancing to Maskandi hit song Van Damme in a red robe at his house. He titled the video &#8220;2017 state of mind&#8221;. It shows him dancing on a table while his son watches. It is, however, not his dance moves that have left more than 2 000 comments on his post. The robe he was wearing failed to hide his underwear, and fans started talking about his manhood. &#8220;And of course you had to give a sneak preview of your van damme thiza nkosi,&#8221; said one of his followers. Another said they had watched the video several times but got scared every time the robe revealed what was underneath.
