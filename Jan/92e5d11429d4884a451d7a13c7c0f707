ANC activist Shaka Sisulu has dismissed reports that he spearheaded the ruling party s alleged covert campaign meant to target the DA and EFF election campaigns during last year s hotly contested municipal polls. Taking to social networking site Twitter, Sisulu &#8211; the grandson of late ANC veteran Walter Sisulu and the son of former National Assembly speaker Max Sisulu rubbished the report published by amaBhungane on Tuesday as fake news , saying no one is safe from the recent wave of false news reports.
