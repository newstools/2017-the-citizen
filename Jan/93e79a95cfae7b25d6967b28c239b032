Popular radio and TV personality Jeremy Mansfield wished his Facebook followers well for the New Year on Monday before making an unexpected announcement that he would be getting involved in politics. He said an old school friend, now an MP, had convinced him to run for the DA in 2019. He wrote: &#8220;Belated New Year greetings. May 2017 bring blessings to our country, its people and animals. I will be trying to make my contribution. After years of badgering, my school mate Ross Purdon (MP) has finally convinced me to run for the DA in the 2019 elections. So the work starts now!&#8221; This was met by an avalanche of comments, with some people criticising him as just another celebrity, like Steve Hofmeyr and Nikki van den Berg, who thinks he can get involved in politics. Mansfield said that he wasn&#8217;t a celebrity, just a &#8220;citizen trying to make a difference&#8221;. A number of people were excited that Mansfield is likely to push for animal rights as a politician. However, several insults were mixed in with support and compliments, prompting Mansfield to write early on Wednesday: &#8220;Wow! Amazed at some of the accusations and vitriol posted on my site after my last post saying I had agreed to run for the DA in the next election. I have been accused of wife abuse, entering politics for financial gain and been told I am not a pleasant person for a variety of reasons. And that&#8217;s before I&#8217;ve even gone into politics! I am already starting to grow my thick skin, because when I am there I will be even more vocal. I think Louise Huisamenn summed it up in a post by saying why are on my Facebook book page if you hate me so much. Unfriend me!&#8221; This second post was met with mostly messages of support: Alexandra Jane Church wrote that &#8220;fear brings out the worst in people. Far more positive support &#8230; negative few just makes you more prepared for what you&#8217;re up against. Go Jeremy!&#8221; Jennifer Hunter added: &#8220;The trolls that post nasty comments are not worth reacting to. They will move on to their next target just as quickly. Sadly they live amongst us. Wishing you all the best. This country needs more people like you to step up.&#8221;
