Dodoma.

Geographically, this region is not expected to receive abundant rain fall thus, we must assist farmers by introducing irrigation, he said.Regional agriculture officer Abraham Isack said: A number of people consider the scarcity of rain as a curse. The dry climatic conditions in the region are just not being exploited for alternative agricultural projects. He added that interventions by NGOs in the region do not offer long term solutions. Most NGOs and other stakeholders assist farmers in cultivating crops that require heavy rainfall instead of promoting drought-resistance crops, he revealed.
