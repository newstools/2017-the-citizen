The Democratic Alliance has laid charges against alleged African National Congress members who assaulted a DA ward candidate in Uniondale in the Western Cape. On Friday, ANC members allegedly assaulted the DA candidate for ward 25 Marchell Kleynhans, DA campaign manager in the upcoming by-election in ward 25 Teritius Simmers said in a statement. The assault took place as he entered the Uniondale police station to report the ANC for peddling misinformation to community members. Another DA activist was also assaulted and threatened by ANC members on the same day. The incident took place in her home, he said on Sunday. The DA had since laid charges of assault with the South African Police Service (SAPS) following the incidents. It was unacceptable that people were threatened or intimidated when they exercised their right to vote, campaign, or participate in election activities. The DA had repeatedly raised concerns about the ANC s breach of the Electoral Code of Conduct with the Electoral Commission of South Africa (IEC). We have also made known our concerns about the unwillingness by the SAPS to take action against incidents of intimidation. The DA would continue to do all it could to ensure that the by-election in ward 25 was free and fair. However, for this to happen, all parties had to adhere to the Electoral Code of Conduct. We therefore urge the ANC to demonstrate tolerance and respect for democratic process, Simmers said. African News Agency (ANA)
