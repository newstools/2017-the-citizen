It has recently come to Statistics South Africa s attention that individuals posing as Stats SA officials have been calling people asking for their personal information, such as identity numbers. &#8220;Stats SA does not request identity numbers from respondents when conducting surveys. Whereas we may use telephone interviews to collect information for some business surveys, Stats SA does not conduct household-based surveys over the phone,&#8221; the Stats SA said in a statement. Everyone is urged not to divulge any personal information to anyone claiming to be to a Stats SA representative over the phone, the Lowvelder reported. All Stats SA fieldworkers carry identification cards. To verify the identity of a Stats SA fieldworker, contact their call centre on 012 310 8600. &#8211; Caxton News Service For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
