Payet, 29, joined West Ham from Marseille in a reported 10.7 million ($13.1 million, 12.3 million euros) deal in 2015 and had a sensational first season, scoring 12 goals and supplying 12 assists. But with West Ham lying 13th in the Premier League table and amid speculation linking him with a return to Marseille, the France international has decided he wants out. &#8220;We have said we don&#8217;t want to sell our best players, but Dimitri Payet does not want to play for us,&#8221; Bilic told a press conference. But he added: &#8220;We are not going to sell him.&#8221; Bilic has asked Payet to stay away from training and said he would not feature in Saturday&#8217;s home game with Crystal Palace. Payet signed a new five-and-a-half-year contract last February and Bilic seemed annoyed by the player&#8217;s stance. &#8220;We have said hundreds of times we don&#8217;t want to sell our best players. He&#8217;s definitely our best player,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That&#8217;s why we gave him a long contract and then a new contract four months later. I phoned him with that and he refused to play for us. I have a team to manage. &#8220;He&#8217;s probably been tapped up by some clubs or whatever. That is usual at this time of year. &#8220;But until he changes his attitude he is out of the team and he&#8217;s not going to train with us. But we are not going to sell him.&#8221; Payet is reported to be the top January transfer target for Marseille coach Rudi Garcia, who previously worked with him at Lille between 2011 and 2013. The Frenchman&#8217;s departure would be a major blow to West Ham and their fans, for whom Payet has become a terrace darling. Despite the stand-off between player and club, Bilic remains hopeful that Payet has not played his last game for West Ham. &#8220;I expect him to come back and show commitment and determination to the team, like the team has shown to him,&#8221; said the Croatian. &#8220;I have spoken to the club, the chairman and the vice-chairman. It&#8217;s not a money issue. We want to keep him. That&#8217;s it.&#8221; After a seventh-place finish last season, West Ham have struggled to adapt to life in their new London Stadium home &#8212; formerly the Olympic Stadium &#8212; and were thrashed 5-0 by Manchester City in the FA Cup last Friday.
