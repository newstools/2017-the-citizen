The forward, dubbed &#8220;King Kazu&#8221; by Japanese media and fans, will take his career into a remarkable 32nd season after agreeing a one-year deal, the J-League second-tier club said. &#8220;I was able to renew my contract for the 2017 season,&#8221; Miura said in a statement. &#8220;I am determined to continue fighting with all of my strength together with people who have supported me &#8212; club staff, team mates, and fans.&#8221; The former Genoa and Dinamo Zagreb player, who will turn 50 on February 26, attracts immense public admiration and broke his own mark as the J-league&#8217;s oldest goalscorer after netting at the age of 49 in June last year. Miura&#8217;s lengthy career began with a move to Brazil at age 15 before he made his name in the early 1990s when he was Asia&#8217;s best-known footballer, helping to build Japan&#8217;s football culture after the professional J-League was launched in 1993. He blazed a trail for Japanese players when he joined Italy&#8217;s Genoa in 1994 and, despite scoring 55 goals in 89 appearances for Japan, was famously axed from the Japan squad before the country&#8217;s first World Cup appearance in 1998, sparking a national debate. Miura finally got his dream to play for Japan in a World Cup at 45 &#8212; albeit in the futsal version in Thailand.
