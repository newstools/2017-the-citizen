Four people aged between 19 and 31 appeared in the Dannhauser Magistrate s Court on Friday on charges of possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition, KwaZulu-Natal police said. On 26 January 2016 a joint operation by Dannhauser, Hattingspruit, and Normandien police yielded positive results when they arrested four suspects for unlicensed firearms and ammunition. The members received information about illegal firearms hidden at a house in the area near Osizweni. They then proceeded to that house and it was identified and searched. They found four suspects in the house, and three unlicensed firearms (all 9mm pistols) with ammunition in a bag were recovered. The suspects were arrested and charged for possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition. All firearms were seized from the suspects, Zwane said. KwaZulu-Natal acting police commissioner Maj-Gen Bheki Langa commended the members for their continuous efforts that led to the firearms recovery and arrests of the suspects. I would like to say well done to the members for their commitment in getting rid of illegal firearms from the community. The recovered firearms will be sent for ballistic tests to establish if they were used in any other crime. We will ensure that the arrested suspects will be profiled to see if they are wanted for house robbery, business robberies, or hijackings in the province, he said.
