There is an international feel to Friday s race meeting at Fairview as French jockey Stephane Pasquier will be in action. Pasquier has been invited to ride in the country and will participate in four meetings at different venues, which includes Saturday s Sun Met meeting at Kenilworth in Cape Town. The main event at Fairview is the Fairview Merchants (Non-Black Type) over 1200m on the turf and Pasquier has the ride on Insearchofthesun for local champion trainer Alan Greeff. They come up against an old adversary in Villa Del Lago and if the Frenchman can get something extra out of this seven-year-old gelding he could very well reverse the placings with Justin Snaith s charge. The last time they met was in October last year and Insearchofthesun finished third, beaten 2.30 lengths. There is a 4kg swing in favour of Pasquier s mount and they could very well reverse the placings. Even second-placed Normanz, who was just a short head in front of Insearchofthesun, will struggle to conform the form as the latter is now 0.5kg better off. Raymond Danielson takes the ride on Villa De Largo and the last time he was aboard the seven-year-old son of Jallad ran out a winner by 2.25 lengths. However, the horse they will all have to beat is Juan Two Three, another inmate from the Greeff yard. He has won his last three races and while two of them have been on the Polytrack, he is equally at home on turf. Juan Two Three is just four-years-old and the son of Var still has further improvement to come. Greg Cheyne takes the ride. One also cannot write off the chances of Sir Duke but he does look held by both Juan Two Three and Villa Del Lago. For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
