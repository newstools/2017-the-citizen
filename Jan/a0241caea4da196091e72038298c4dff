Kiernan &#8216;AKA&#8217; Forbes is on holiday in Hong Kong with his girlfriend, Bonang Matheba, and by the looks of it, he has been having the time of his life. He took to Twitter on Sunday to post videos and pictures of all the expensive clothes he bought and said he was not going to let any critic stop him. &#8220;When other artists floss, they&#8217;re &#8216;inspirational&#8217; &#8230;. I hardly do it. F*ck am I supposed to do? &#8230;. not live? So there you go,&#8221; he said. WE FROM THE NORTH WAY!!! pic.twitter.com/35OczCMfZc &mdash; AKA (@akaworldwide) January 15, 2017 However, after posting this tweet, one of his followers zoomed in on the picture and pointed out to AKA that the clothes he was buying were &#8216;on sale&#8217;, according to the sign that was right next to the shoes. In a tweet that has since been deleted, he said while everyone else saw the black bags, all he saw was the &#8216;sale&#8217; sign, a comment both AKA and his girlfriend would not take lying down. Bonang came to her boyfriend&#8217;s defence, not that he needed it, as he&#8217;s pretty good at doing that himself. Also read: AKA won t be humiliated by flying business class again &#8220;That&#8217;s what you WILL see when you don&#8217;t have money, power and respect,&#8221; she said, leaving most saying the troll deserved it. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t want to have to do this &#8230;. but I spent 80k at that store today. Now, go F*ck yourself,&#8221; AKA said. I didn&#39;t want to have to do this &#8230;. but I spent 80k at that store today. Now, go Fuck yourself. https://t.co/4h5q81qHh1 &mdash; AKA (@akaworldwide) January 15, 2017 The Supa Mega has been on a spending spree, living it up in Thailand and Hong Kong, and also recording a video for his hit song, The World Is Yours. While some reports speculated that he spent about R100 000, he said the amount did not even cover the flights. Only he knows just how much he spent on this trip.
