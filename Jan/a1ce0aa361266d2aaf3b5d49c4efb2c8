Rapper Thato Madonsela, popularly known as L-Tido, recently shared an opinion on the acceptable number of sexual partners one should have slept with so far this year, and the backlash has been strong. Taking to Twitter, L-Tido told his followers that if they had already slept with more than one person this year, they were a &#8220;hoe&#8221;. If you already slept with more than 1 person in 2017 you&#39;re hoe. &mdash; 16V (@L_Tido) January 25, 2017 Most fans hit back, saying he did not have the right to comment on people&#8217;s sexual lives, further commenting on his music, which they said was not impressive. &#8220;If you&#8217;re a rapper and don&#8217;t have a new jam in 2017, you&#8217;re whack,&#8221; said one. Another told him that his music took the mannequin challenge to the next level, and &#8220;you have no business in discussing time period&#8221;. Perhaps the best comment from this mess was by user Vuyolwethu Buda, who made L-Tido aware it was possible to have slept with more than one partner, rightfully so. He asked if President Jacob Zuma, having four wives, deserved to be called such. @L_Tido Even le Jacob Zuma?? &mdash; Vuyolwethu Buda (@Vuyolwetho1) January 25, 2017
