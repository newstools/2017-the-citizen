Oakbay has described a hard-hitting affidavit filed by Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan to counter their allegations of a political agenda as &#8220;reverse victim syndrome&#8221;. Gordhan filed papers in the High Court in Pretoria in response to Oakbay&#8217;s opposing affidavit, in which it asks the court to dismiss the minister&#8217;s application for an order, declaring that there was no law which empowered him to interfere in the decision by South Africa&#8217;s four major banks to close Oakbay&#8217;s accounts and not to do business with them. Gordhan said in a lengthy reply that Oakbay&#8217;s stance made no sense, as it now suddenly shifted position and accepted that he had no legal authority or duty to interfere in its banker-client relationships, while still insisting that &#8220;decisive action&#8221; must be taken against the banks. He strenuously denied Oakbay&#8217;s allegations that he was part of a plot to &#8220;clip their wings&#8221; and that his application was launched to &#8220;hit back&#8221; at the &#8220;disastrous&#8221; Hawks investigation against him and was timed to precede President Jacob Zuma&#8217;s legal bid to suppress to release of former Public Protector Thuli Mandonsela&#8217;s state capture report.

He said Oakbay&#8217;s opposition to his application was unreasonable and that the company sought to use the application as a springboard to salvage its commercial and other interests. &#8220;Yet it did not even address the banks&#8217; affidavits (in support of his application). Instead, it used many months to construct far-ranging accusations against me. &#8220;In truth, what stands revealed as the real plot is the systematic and highly organised campaign by the Gupta family and its associates against the National Treasury, myself and other targets,&#8221; he said. Gordhan attached extracts from the state capture report to his affidavit, which he said supported the Financial Intelligence Centre&#8217;s report about &#8220;suspicious transactions&#8221; involving billions of rands, which the banks relied on to close Oakbay&#8217;s accounts. Oakbay said, in a statement, that they looked forward to clearing their name in court. &#8220;The applicant proactively came after us and smeared our name with a flawed list of transactions &#8211; that he used his unique executive power to obtain &#8211; and then questions the manner of our response to him. &#8220;All of this changes nothing. Our bank accounts remain closed and no evidence exists to prove why that is the case,&#8221; the group said. For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
