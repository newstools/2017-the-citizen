Former champion Giniel de Villiers of South Africa charged back into contention on Thursday, brushing off a number of setbacks to take sixth place on stage four of the Dakar Rally. De Villiers and German co-driver Dirk von Zitzewitz covered the 416km timed section between San Salvador and Tupiza 24 minutes, 04 seconds (24:04) slower than stage winner Cyril Despres of France. The South African driver admitted they had struggled in the soft dunes on the high-altitude leg as the race moved from Argentina to Bolivia.

His Toyota Gazoo Racing SA teammate Nasser Al-Attiyah was forced to withdraw from the event ahead of stage four, after he had established his place among the early leaders, and Spaniard Nani Roma was leading the local outfit in fifth place overall. South African co-driver Rob Howie and Zimbabwean teammate Conrad Rautenbach were in 18th position.

Fellow Husqvarna rider Pablo Quintanilla of Chile took the lead up front. Co-driver Sean Berriman, the lone SA representative in the truck division, was lying 24th overall with MAN teammates Mathias Behringer and Stefan Henken of Germany.
