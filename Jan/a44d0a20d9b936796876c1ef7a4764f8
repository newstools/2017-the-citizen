South Africa will continue to pursue bilateral and regional negotiations with the British government despite its exit from the European Union (UE), the Minister of Trade and Industry (the dti) Rob Davies said on Tuesday. Speaking after his arrival from a two-day visit to the United Kingdom, Davies said the country s strategy post-Brexit was to concluded a free-trade agreement with Britain. We had a number of meetings with investors and parliamentarians to encourage and boost trade between South Africa and the UK, Davies said. We don t have a duty-free quota with the UK. Our our template going forward will be partnerships but in the long run we will have to have quotas. After its formal withdrawal from the EU, the United Kingdom will no longer be a party to any of the trade agreements between the EU and any other country or regional bloc. South African exporters have had preferential access to UK markets under two consecutive agreements entered into with the EU as a regional bloc namely the Trade and Development Co-operation Agreement (TDCA) since 2000, which was more recently superseded by the SADC-EU Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA).
