Given that he&#8217;s taken six wickets in his first two matches as a national player, it was hardly surprising that Lungi Ngidi on Monday was included in the Proteas one-day squad for the upcoming series against Sri Lanka. The 20-year-old quick bowler from the Titans has made massive impression in the T20 series, especially in claiming excellent figures of 4/19 at the Wanderers at the weekend. &#8220;Lungi has been rewarded for his excellent form in the current T20 series,&#8221; said Linda Zondi, the convener of selectors. &#8220;We are keen to see how he goes in the 50-over format. He has not only impressed with the wickets he has taken and the skills he has displayed but with the energy and intensity he has brought to his game as well.&#8221; As expected, AB de Villiers is also back as captain of the side, having not played international cricket since July. &#8220;It is wonderful to have AB back available both as player and leader,&#8221; said Zondi. &#8220;The ODI squad is in very good space at the moment after the clean sweep (last year) over Australia, but Sri Lanka will pose another stiff challenge.&#8221; The only other change is the lanky Chris Morris, who returns from injury. His all-round ability adds even more versatility to a squad that already boasts various players capable of batting and bowling. This first of five ODIs starts in Port Elizabeth on Saturday. Proteas squad: AB de Villiers (c), Hashim Amla, Farhaan Behardien, Quinton de Kock, JP Duminy, Faf du Plessis, Imran Tahir, David Miller, Chris Morris, Wayne Parnell, Lungi Ngidi, Andile Phehlukwayo, Dwaine Pretorius, Kagiso Rabada, Tabraiz Shamsi.
