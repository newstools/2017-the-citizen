She has raced 24 times and 13 of those have been in Grade 1 races. Sean Tarry s charge has won three Grade 1s and placed in another six. She also has one Grade 2 and one Grade 3 victory to her credit and the five-year-old daughter of Captain Al will be looking to add yet another feature race to her curriculum vitae when she lines in the Grade 2 Cartier Sceptre Stakes over 1200m at Kenilworth today. Last year she was sent out a 9-10 favourite for this race but she ran on too late and could only finish fifth, beaten 1.60 lengths by Princess Royal. She probably needed her last run when going down 0.50 lengths to Jo s Bond in her last start but that was her first run in six months. Jockey S manga Khumalo, who has ridden her in all of her eight victories, takes the ride again. There has rarely been much between Carry On Alice and Real Princess and that is likely to be the case in this event. Tarry s charge has come out on top in most of their meetings but in June it was the Dean Kannemeyer-trainer daughter of Trippi who got her revenge when winning the Grade 1 SA Fillies Classic over 1200m at Scottsville. However, it could be a Scandal that splits the two on this occasion. Corne Spies runner flew up last time to finish 0.40 lengths behind Carry On Alice last time and had Real Princess 2.75 lengths behind her. Based on the manner in which Scandal ran on, the four-year-old daughter of Muhtafal is likely to confirm that run, especially as they meet at identical weights. In addition, the extra 200m is likely to suit the Spies runner. Craig Zackey makes the trip from Johannesburg to ride the filly. For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
