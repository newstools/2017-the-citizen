Music legend Sipho &#8216;Hotstix&#8217; Mabuse had interesting things to say about poet Ntsiki Mazwai in an interview with Kuli Roberts and co on SABC3&#8217;s Trending SA on Thursday. Roberts asked Mabuse how he felt when Mazwai called him a &#8220;gossiper&#8221; after he tried to intervene in her beef with fellow musician Simphiwe Dana on Twitter last year. Mazwai lashed out at Mabuse for trying to intervene on Twitter, saying it showed he was looking for attention. &#8220;You can&#8217;t call people to order on Twitter &#8230; that&#8217;s just show-off. And looking for attention,&#8221; she said at the time, a comment that upset Roberts. &#8220;I do not appreciate it when someone calls you a gossiper. You&#8217;re an elder and our legend,&#8221; she said. However, Mabuse said he was not bothered by Mazwai&#8217;s comments. &#8220;It&#8217;s okay you know, you must allow people small-minded people also the right to express themselves,&#8221; he said. Mabuse said he was only shocked by Mazwai&#8217;s comments as she had, at some point, approached him to work with her, though he said he would still work with her if the opportunity arose. Roberts added Mazwai was just bitter because he could not work with her. I heard about Uncle Hotstix comments on national tv&#8230;im afraid i cant stoop down to that level. i send him peace, love and good PR &mdash; Imbongikazi yeSizwe (@ntsikimazwai) January 13, 2017 Mazwai went on a rant of her own on Twitter, responding to Roberts and Mabuse. &#8220;I heard about Uncle Hotstix comments on national TV&#8230;I&#8217;m afraid I cant stoop down to that level. I send him peace, love and good PR,&#8221; she said. My elder u were hitting on me and i said no and ur lashing out publicly? I see lemme focus on Ntsiki &mdash; Imbongikazi yeSizwe (@ntsikimazwai) January 13, 2017 She said she did not care what Mabuse and Roberts thought of her. &#8220;It does not affect my life even one bit,&#8221; she said before she changed her mind and told fans why she thought he said such things about her. I can&#39;t even respond cos i dont really care what he and kuli roberts think of me&#8230;..it does not affect my life even one bit &mdash; Imbongikazi yeSizwe (@ntsikimazwai) January 13, 2017 &#8220;My elder, you were hitting on me, and I said no and your lashing out publicly? I see lemme focus on Ntsiki,&#8221; she said. She said she was not going to give him the satisfaction of hating him, as it was bad enough that she intimidated him. &#8220;Old men are so pathetic when they want you&#8230;..tantrums and sh*t,&#8221; she added, calling him jealous.
