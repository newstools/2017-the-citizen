The British government is no longer the biggest shareholder in state-rescued Lloyds bank, after selling another tranche of shares, the two sides announced Monday. &#8220;The plan to return Lloyds Banking Group to the private sector passed a significant milestone today when it was confirmed that the government is no longer the largest shareholder,&#8221; the Treasury said in a statement. &#8220;The latest share sales&#8230; have reduced the government&#8217;s remaining shareholding to less than 6.0 percent and below the level of the next largest shareholder.&#8221; The announcement means that US fund manager BlackRock is now the bank&#8217;s single biggest stakeholder. Britain&#8217;s government rescued Lloyds with 20 billion of taxpayers&#8217; money at the height of the global financial crisis in 2008. The government has since gradually sold down its original 43-percent stake in the bank and the Treasury on Monday said it had recouped more than 18.0 billion ($22.1 billion, 21 billion euros) from share sales. Returning Lloyds to the private sector and recovering all of the cash the taxpayer injected into the bank during the financial crisis is a priority for the government,&#8221; said finance minister Philip Hammond. Last month, Lloyds bought Bank of America&#8217;s UK credit card division MBNA for 1.9 billion in the first acquisition since its government bailout. Lloyds Banking Group was created by a merger of Lloyds TSB and rival British lender HBOS. However, HBOS was saddled with toxic property investments, and LBG subsequently received the vast bailout. 1994-2017 Agence France-Presse
