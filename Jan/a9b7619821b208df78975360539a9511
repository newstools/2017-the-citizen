All hell broke loose at Grace Bible Church in Soweto after choreographer Somizi Mhlongo stormed out of the church building during an &#8220;offending&#8221; sermon on Sunday. Taking to Instagram, the fuming Somizi said the church, pastored by Bishop Mosa Sono, had invited another pastor from &#8220;somewhere in Africa&#8221; to preach at their service today. All was going well until the pastor took a detour and started talking about homosexuality and how &#8220;disgusting&#8221; and &#8220;sinful&#8221; it was, said Somizi. The choreographer said the pastor went as far as saying homosexuality was so disgusting even animals did not &#8220;practise&#8221; it, remarks that left the church in cheers, much to Somizi&#8217;s shock. No opinion or advice needed. I&#8217;m just venting. @grace_bible_church A video posted by Somizi (@somizi) on Jan 22, 2017 at 1:16am PST In the second video he posted on Instagram after the incident, Somizi made a plea to churches to be vocal about whether homosexuals were accepted so that he can look for a different place of worship if his homosexuality was a problem. &#8220;I would like to make a plea to churches and mine particularly because I got to Grace Bible Church. Pastor Mosa Sono, say it out that &#8216;homosexuality is not allowed. Homosexuality is a sin. Gay people must not come to our church.&#8217; &#8220;Say it so that we know, because we go to church to speak to our God whom I believe accepts me for who I am, whom I believe created me the way I am.
