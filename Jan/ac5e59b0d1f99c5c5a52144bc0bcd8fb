Mbulu. Police in Mbulu District have arrested a man suspected to have beaten his six-year-old son to death after allegedly losing five goats he was grazing.Manyara Regional Police Commander Francis Massawe told The Citizen that the suspect was arrested after villagers found the boy s body hidden in a thicket. Preliminary investigations have established that the suspect severely beat his son with a stick after the boy reportedly lost five goats he was grazing on a field near the family home, he said.Mr Massawe added that the suspect hid the boy s body in a thicket after realising he had killed him. Villagers discovered the body and alerted police, who arrested the suspect. There were signs on the child s body showing he was beaten mercilessly. Beside the body was a stick thought to have been used in the assault. Mr Massawe said the man would appear in court soon in connection with the boy s death.Mbulu District Commissioner Celestino Mofuga expressed his shock at the incident, saying it was sad that there were a few people in the area who had little or no respect for the sanctity of human life. What has this world come to? How can a person kill his own child for losing a mere five goats? Are five goats equivalent to the life of a human being? he asked.He blamed the prevalence of violence in some parts of the district on drunkenness, saying people, especially men, were venting their frustrations on their families after going on gongo drinking binges. Mbulu residents should shun drunkenness, which is the root cause of domestic violence. When alcohol becomes a source of tragedy and suffering then something needs to be done and fast, Mr Mofufa said.
