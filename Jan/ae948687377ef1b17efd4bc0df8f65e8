RCL Foods warned on Tuesday that its financial results for the six months ended December 31, 2016, would be materially impacted by the severe challenges faced by the local chicken industry due to dumped imports and high feed input costs. As a result, RCL Food said it expected that its headline earnings per share (HEPS) to be expected to be between 40 cents and 55 cents, or 54.1% and 36.9% less, when compared to 87.2 cents for the corresponding period. RCL Foods the maker of Nola Mayonnaise, Selati Sugar, Yum Yum peanut butter, and Rainbow Simply Chicken announced its intention in September 2016 to downsize its chicken business unit to restore its profitability by limiting production. The chicken business unit has since initiated a programme to reduce its Hammarsdale operations to a single shift and dismiss 1 350 workers, thereby eliminating a portion of loss-making Individually Quick Frozen product. RCL Foods said the chicken business unit was expected to record a loss for the first six months of the financial year. RCL Foods said the interim financial results for the six months ended December 31, 2016, were impacted by three material abnormal items, including an after-tax impairment of R102.7 million for redundant plant and equipment related to the decision to reduce commodity chicken volumes. The chicken producer s results were also materially impacted by release of R163.3 million provision for uncertain taxation disputes raised as part of Foodcorp acquisition.
