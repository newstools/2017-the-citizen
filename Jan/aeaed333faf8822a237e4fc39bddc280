Babes Wodumo is currently shooting a music video for her single, Family, and we are impressed with what we&#8217;ve seen so far, especially knowing that Refiloe &#8216;Cassper Nyovest&#8217; Phoolo features in the video. Cassper is also impressed with what Babes has been showing him on the dancefloor and has not stopped talking about her since. &#8220;Babes Wodumo is too much boys!!
