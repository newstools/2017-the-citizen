South African music legends came out in their numbers to celebrate the life of Klaasen, who was Nelson Mandela&#8217;s favourite singer. Her memorial was held at the Germiston City Hall and attended by Letta Mbulu, Dorothy Masuku, Abigail Kubeka, Blondie Makhene, Caiphus Semenya, Communications Minister Faith Muthambi, Ekurhuleni Mayor Mzwandile Masina and MP Mondli Gungubele. According to The Star, Klassen&#8217;s son, Roger Mpambane, his mother was a deeply spiritual woman. &#8220;That woman knew and respected God. And she taught me to include God in everything I do. My mother also had a big heart, and she was strong,&#8221; said Mpambane. Lorraine, the only daughter Klaasen had, said her mother was very supportive and would visit her in Canada to teach her about her history. &#8220;At that time my mother came alive. I could see that this was healing her. But when she came back to South Africa, her spirit was low because she was not getting the same attention.&#8221; Ancedotes of Klaasen&#8217;s life was shared, and choirs sang songs in memory of her. In a statement, the metro said a unanimous decision was taken by the council to accord Thandi the civic funeral, which it said was a befitting funeral she deserved . Klaasen s funeral is set be held Friday at Heroes Acres. Further details will be released later. For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
