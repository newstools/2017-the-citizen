Following a turbulent 2016 that saw several racist incidents being reported on social media and questions around the country s reconciliation after decades of racial segregation, 2017 might prove to be yet another year of hate speech based on race. In the latest incident online, a Limpopo man, Phillip Roodt, called black bathers cockroaches on Facebook. He described crowded beaches in Amanzimtoti, south of Durban, where he recently went on holiday, with the words: Good afternoon from a pitch-black Amanzimtoti where the sea is a tar road full of potholes. Dear damn I can t believe how many black cockroaches are having a holiday on stolen money and on robbed white people s tax money. I hope the f***ers drown one by one. Phillip Roodt Facebook post.

His comments come almost a year to the day since KwaZulu-Natal real estate agent Penny Sparrow was exposed for her racist Facebook comments after she compared black bathers to monkeys. Sparrow, who s been subsequently ordered by the Equality Court in Umzinto to pay R150 000 to the Oliver and Adelaide Tambo Foundation for her post, faced the criminal charge of crimen injuria and had to pay an additional fine for that charge. She is understood not to have made the payments yet. For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
