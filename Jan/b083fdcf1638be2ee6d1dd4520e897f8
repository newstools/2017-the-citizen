A Port Elizabeth top cop was robbed at his home and stabbed in the head on Wednesday evening. Provincial Police Spokesperson, Brigadier Marinda Mills, confirmed that Major General Dawie Rabie came under attack at his home in Summerstrand. Rabie is the Motherwell cluster commander and was the previous Mount Road cluster commander for a number of years. He was in his home with his grandchild and another family member when they heard other voices in the house, said Mills. Mills said that upon investigations four suspects were discovered in the house. A confrontation between the suspects and Maj Gen Rabie ensued. The suspects fled with three cellphones and an Ipad, she said. Entrance to the house was gained by removing burglar bars from a bedroom window. Mills said that Rabie sustained minor injuries during the confrontation with the suspects and was treated at home. Police are investigating a case of armed robbery and assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. No arrests have been made.
