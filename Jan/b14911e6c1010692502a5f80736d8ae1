Police have dug up the remains of yet another person after a man confessed to have helped bury &#8220;what seemed to be a human body in a makeshift grave&#8221;. On Wednesday morning, the police dug up the remains of a 61-year-old-man who was allegedly killed by his 37-year-old wife and her lover, 32. Police spokesperson Captain Kay Makhubele said the victim had only been reported missing just over a week ago. &#8220;Following the discovery last week of the remains of a Temba woman that had also been reported missing in October 2016 by her husband, a 32-year old man approached the police with information that he had assisted a friend in December 2016 to bury what seemed to be a human body in a makeshift grave. &#8220;The man directed the police to the grave, and the police have since dug up the remains of the deceased,&#8221; Makhubele said. The man is currently detained at Temba Police Station for further questioning. Makhubele added that at about 2pm yesterday afternoon, the victim&#8217;s wife handed herself over to the police at the Temba Police Station, north of Pretoria. Meanwhile the police are searching for her boyfriend. A week ago police uncovered the burnt remains of a 36-year-old woman in Hammanskraal after her boyfriend Thabo James Dube confessed to killing her. Meisie Molefe, a cook at a local school, was reported missing on October 6, last year, by her boyfriend. However, after keeping the secret for months, her 38-year old boyfriend and father of her daughter, 2, told police he killed her. He buried her in his backyard in Hammanskraal, where police found her remains after 18 hours of digging. Dube appeared in court but did not apply for bail. He will remain in custody until he appears in court later this year.
