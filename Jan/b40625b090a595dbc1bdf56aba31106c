A manhunt has been launched for about 20 armed robbers who robbed a business in Makhado in the early hours of Saturday morning, Limpopo police said. According to information, the police responded to a complaint of an assault of a security guard at Ash Cash and Carry in Unika Street in the Makhado industrial area, police said in a statement on the official South African Police Service (SAPS) Facebook page. On arrival [of the police] the suspects in two vehicles opened fire at the police who retaliated until the suspects abandoned the vehicles and ran into the nearby bushes. The suspects managed to get away with two 9mm pistols from the guards and an undisclosed amount of cash from the cash register. This after their failed attempt to blast open the safe with explosives. The recovered BMW had been reported stolen in Cleveland, Johannesburg, and the Isuzu KB bakkie in Randfontein on the West Rand, both in December 2016. Two of our backup members sustained minor injuries during the shoot-out. It is not clear if any of the suspects got shot during the incident. A manhunt has been launched for the suspects and police investigations continue. Anyone with information is requested to contact Makhado SAPS at 015-519-4300, the CrimeStop number 08600-10111, or the nearest police station, the statement said. African News Agency (ANA)
