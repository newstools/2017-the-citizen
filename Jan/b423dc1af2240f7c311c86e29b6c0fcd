Monday January 23 Neo&#8217;s attempts to make things go his way are thwarted by two women in his life. Mangi is relieved that he will not be part of a crime, and surprised when an offer is turned down. Gloria makes a revelation which shocks Ndumiso and worries Gontse. Tuesday January 24 Much to Siseko&#8217;s satisfaction, someone is lured out of the woodwork to tell the truth about the past. Mangi&#8217;s life takes a turn for the better on two counts. Ndumiso makes an adamant assertion, but a friend isn&#8217;t so sure that he believes him. Wednesday January 25 Siseko finally gets what he has been hoping for, but it comes at a price. Stokkies is concerned that a dangerous plan could come back to bite him badly. Gontse&#8217;s timing is perfect but she misinterprets what she sees. Thursday January 26 The truth about a terrible crime is about to be revealed, and someone steps in to try and stop it. Stokkies unexpectedly comes face to face with an old acquaintance. Ndumiso&#8217;s &#8216;forgetfulness&#8217; and Gontse&#8217;s tricks cause unhappiness. Friday January 27 Neo visits Yvonne with an important ulterior motive, and two thugs are worried when an attack doesn&#8217;t quite go according to plan. Mangi receives a special gift, and panics at a frightening implication. Phindile is thrown by an acquaintance&#8217;s very odd behaviour.
