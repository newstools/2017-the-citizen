A 13-year-old boy has appeared in the Athlone Magistrate s Court on a charge of murder, police said in a statement on Tuesday. The teenager was arrested on Monday morning in Crossroads, a township outside Cape Town. Police spokesperson Constable Noloyiso Rwexana said the boy allegedly stabbed a 16-year-old on Saturday night. The two had an argument while they were playing games in New Rest Crossroads. It is alleged the suspect went to fetch a knife somewhere and stabbed the deceased. The victim was transported to hospital where he later died due to his injuries, Rwexana said. In another incident, a 24-year-old man is expected to appear in court this week after he was arrested on Monday for allegedly raping a six-year-old girl a week ago. Rwexana said the child was left in his care in the Cape Town township Samora Machel.
