After six days, firefighters continued to battle a fire blazing in Somerset West in Cape Town on Monday. Disaster Risk Management Centre spokesperson Theo Layne said more than R53 million in structural damage alone had been estimated so far. The fire has been raging for six days. Layne said the main objective was to ensure that the fire didn t jump over already burnt areas into living vegetation. The wind, as well as the terrain [on the mountain], aren t helping. The ground crew are traversing the terrain at the moment, basically firefighters are having to do some mountain climbing, he said. Approximately 300 firefighters, including volunteers, were on the scene on Monday.

Layne said the fire started two weeks ago in the Grabouw area, on the other side of the Hottentots-Holland mountain range, but then spread rapidly once it was fed by the winds and raged into the Helderberg basin. The basin is home to wine farms and popular sites used by film crews. But Layne said fires were not unusual at this time of year. There were about 50 to 60 blazing vegetation fires, which were being fought on Monday. He said towards the end of this month and February the number of fires per day may increase to 80 or 90. What triggered the Grabouw fire was being investigated. Layne said to date no serious injuries had been reported. Some firefighters had been treated for smoke inhalation.
