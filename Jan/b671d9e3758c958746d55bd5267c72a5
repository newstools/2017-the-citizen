A manhunt has been under way on Wednesday for a gang who staged a cash-in-transit heist, hijacked a police van and critically wounded a police officer in a shootout in Durban. Directorate for Priority Crime Investigations (Hawks) spokesman Captain Simphiwe Mhlongo said that the incident happened at the Nyala Mall in KwaMashu on Wednesday morning when a group of armed men attacked three security guards who were loading the automated teller machines. The suspects fired shots at the security guards, robbed them of their firearms and managed to steal five cash boxes, he said. The robbers then hijacked an unmarked police van before fleeing. A chase then ensued as detectives from Ntuzuma police station arrived at the scene. The robbers lost control of their hijacked van and crashed it before a shoot-out ensued. One police officer was critically wounded while another sustained minor injuries. More reinforcements were summoned which led to the arrest of one the suspects in the vicinity. Police managed to recover the five cash boxes as well as an unlicensed firearm, said Mhlongo. He said a manhunt was under way for the remaining members of the gang. It was not immediately clear how many members were in the gang. Mhlongo said that the police officer of the hijacked van did not sustain any injuries. They just pointed a gun at her and forced her out, he said. Mhlongo said that the 29-year-old suspect, who was arrested, would appear in the Ntuzuma Magistrate s Court soon. African News Agency (ANA)
