The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) on Friday successfully concluded their negotiations for a one-year wage agreement with Geomechanics, ending a three-day strike at the drilling and mineral exploration company. Headquartered in Johannesburg, Geomechanics and Geomech Africa provides a drilling and testing service to the minerals exploration market as well as the geotechnical and civils industries in southern Africa. Geomechanics workers downed tools on Monday demanding a salary increase of 15 percent across the board, as well as increases provident fund and bonuses. In a statement, the NUM said the agreement would see wage increases of up to 10 percent for the workers, back dated from June 2016. This would also include a R300 allowance a day for work done outside the country. The agreement would be in force for the period 2016/2017. Among the highlights of the agreement is the creation of a provident fund for workers with a 7.5 percent contribution from each party. The NUM said the employer also agreed to pay all employees an amount equal to the employee s basic salary as an annual bonus or 13th cheque in December each year. NUM negotiator Lebogang Ramabolu said the signing of this one-year wage agreement was significant achievement, as it marked the first time that Geomechanics signed a wage agreement with the union. We are agreed to form a task team that will look into other matters such as allowances and medical aid. The role of the task team will also be to find formulas that will work in this regard and give a report back to members, Ramabolu said. The union thanked all its negotiators for the hard work they had done in a very difficult and hostile negotiation , and also thanked members at Geomechanics for their discipline and patience.
