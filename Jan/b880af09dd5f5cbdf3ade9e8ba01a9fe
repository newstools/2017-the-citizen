Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba and member of mayoral committee (MMC) for economic development Sharon Peetz said on Tuesday they would visit Sakhumzi Restaurant, where a manager on duty was shot and killed over the weekend. The manager of the restaurant on Vilakazi Street in Soweto was shot and killed in the early hours of Sunday morning. Sakhumzi restaurant is not the only restaurant that has been victimised by criminal elements seeking to destroy the confidence of business owners, who are working hard at contributing to the economic development of Soweto and the city in general, as well as the local and international patrons and tourists who support them, said Mashaba. This was the second hit on the restaurant, the first being late last year when robbers managed to get away with some of the restaurant s money. Mashaba said they could not sit idly by while the historic street and important township economic hub of the city was held hostage by criminal elements. The proper functioning of such economic hubs is integral to our achievement of our targeted 5% economic growth, as well to the reduction of unemployment to under 20% by 2021. By working together with local police and the greater Soweto community, we can ensure that we create environments that allow for businesses to operate safely and freely, said Mashaba.
