A 36-year-old man will appear in the Tseseng Magistrate s Court in the Free State on Monday in connection with the murder and rape of his girlfriend. The Phuthaditjhaba family, child protection, and sexual offences unit has finally arrested the suspected murderer and rapist of a woman who was found raped and killed at an abandoned house at Tseseng village in QwaQwa earlier this month, police spokesperson Sergeant Mmako Mophiring said on Saturday. The 26-year-old woman s body was found inside an abandoned house at Sedibeng section in [the] area of Tseseng Village without clothes and already dead with multiple stab wounds on her head. It was established that she is from Mafahlaneng township near Tweeling. It was alleged that on January 3, at about 6pm, a young man was seeking a place to shelter from the rain at Tseseng. He probably went to the abandoned house and unfortunately came across the body of a woman on the floor. He rushed to a nearby house of a chief to report the finding and they both went to [the] police station, Mophiring said. On the scene the police found the body in a state of decomposition because it s alleged the woman was reported missing since 1 January 2017. It seems she is not from around QwaQwa but outside places. A man has been taken in for questioning with regard to the incident. On 6 January 2017 the suspect, 36, was finally charged after postmortem results indicated that the woman was raped and later killed. It is alleged that the suspect is the boyfriend of the deceased and is expected to appear before the Tseseng Magistrate s Court on 9 January 2017 facing charges of rape and murder, Mophiring said.
