The Proteas can rightly celebrate their Test series whitewash of Sri Lanka. That achievement is made even sweeter by the fact that they progressively won by bigger margins. Saturday&#8217;s victory by an innings and 118 runs at the Wanderers easily trumps the wins at St George&#8217;s Park (206 runs) and Newlands (282 runs). But there&#8217;s a bigger picture here &#8230; and it&#8217;s not a rosy one. Sri Lanka have gone from reasonably competitive to simply abject in this series. It&#8217;s fun for casual South African fans but it&#8217;s not good for the health of the game, especially the five-day format. Each time a Sri Lankan batsman showed a faulty technique or poor judgement to lose his wicket, you could hear the calls for A- and B-section Test cricket grow. Are the Islanders good enough to compete with South Africa? It&#8217;s a question that will be asked but it&#8217;s actually not a good one. Because before you trash Sri Lanka, remember that they beat Australia 3-0 on the Island. Pakistan were the No 1 ranked Test side before going to Australia and being whitewashed. The point here is that the majority of Test sides focus on winning at home and struggle abroad. That&#8217;s why the Proteas series win in Australia late last year was such a fine achievement. Either way, teams somehow need an incentive to become more adaptable in foreign conditions. Take nothing away from the Protea bowlers, they were ruthless. Resuming on 80/4 in their first innings, Sri Lanka fell foul to the new members of the bowling attack &#8211; Duanne Olivier and Wayne Parnell. After Kagiso Rabada (3/44) and Vernon Philander (3/28) added to their overnight tallies, the support staff took over. Olivier (2/19) bowled an excellent length before Parnell cleaned up the last two batters. Armed with a lead of 295, Faf du Plessis decided to enforce the follow-on and pleasingly, the inexperienced duo led the way. Both were far more aggressive and shorter in their lengths but it paid off against a hapless batting line-up. Parnell finished with a career-best 4/51, while Olivier nabbed 3/37. The left-handed opener Dimuth Karunaratne was the only visitor to provide any resistance, stroking an even 50. But his knock was ended by the best delivery of the day &#8211; a searing in-ducker from Kagiso Rabada (2/50). For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
