Prophet Theo Bongani Maseko of the Breath of Christ Ministries in Daveyton has given his congregants an engine-cleaning fluid to heal them of any disease. In a series of posts on Facebook, Maseko told his congregants that he first bought Havoline and drank it by himself, and everyone he told about it thought it would kill him. &#8220;But I didn&#8217;t, I did this to prove to many of you that I know who I am. And I am no longer a human being. I am the form of God. I am the exact image of my Father. I am the Christ.&#8221; He further told his congregants they would be delivered and healed &#8220;in a strange way&#8221;, further saying the strange healing was to demonstrate a verse in the Bible. &#8220;This is Havoline, but now I say this is the unseen and unheard power of God. This is the fullness of Christ in this bottle. No poison will prosper against you. But all your afflictions will be over today. You will be delivered and healed by the Image of my Father. I say Father thank you for healing your people,&#8221; he said. He explained that the liquid in the bottle he was holding was &#8220;the fullness of Christ&#8221; and that it could &#8220;empty HIV wards&#8221;. &#8220;You can cast out any disease and devils. By looking at this bottle you are now free! By touching it, you are imparted with a strange anointing from above,&#8221; he said.
