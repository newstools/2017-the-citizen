Two African agriculture events running alongside each other in Nairobi next month will tackle the related problems of increasing productivity and decreasing waste. The African Agri Council said in a statement on Tuesday that growing trade volumes in the East African region provided both opportunities and challenges for the agriculture sector. Perishable products often suffer from supply-chain delays and post-harvest losses in remote areas, mostly due to poor infrastructure, lack of appropriate transport systems and a lack of refrigerated transport and storage. Nico Loretz, programme manager for the Agri Logistics and e-Agri East Africa Summits 2017, said: It is against this background that the African Agri Council and Hypenica are hosting these two co-located events . The inaugural Agri Logistics and e-Agri East Africa Summits 2017, taking place in the Kenyan capital from February 28 to March 1, will bring together international ICT, logistics and transport infrastructure professionals and a line-up of East African agricultural thought leaders. Loretz said the events would bring together proven innovative e-agriculture solutions for preventing post-harvest losses, improved production and increased productivity to improve the supply chain process from farmer to market and to enhance food security in the region . Highlights of the Agri Logistics East Africa Summit 2017 will include an in-depth look at first mile transport and development, transport hubs for shipment, cold chain logistics and supply chain innovations and quality certification and customs management for exports. The eAgri East Africa Summit 2017 will include a look at the value of holistic ICT for market linkages, translating agri-information technologies to the East African context, decision support systems and apps to support evidence-based decisions across agricultural value chains.
