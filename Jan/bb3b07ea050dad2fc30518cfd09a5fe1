The Business Process Services (BPS) Incentive Scheme of the department of trade and industry (dti) has created 30,000 jobs since 2011, the department said on Tuesday. The objective of the BPS scheme is to create employment opportunities particularly for the young people of South Africa through servicing offshore activities, department s Chief Operating Officer for Incentives Administration, Susan Mangole, said in a statement. To achieve this objective, we have created more than 30,000 jobs by supporting forty-three companies through BPS at a cost of almost R1 billion. About 86 percent of the jobs are for the youth. Mangole said that the scheme was also aimed at contributing to the country s export revenue from offshoring services. The Portfolio Committee on Trade and Industry visited one of the beneficiaries of the scheme on Tuesday. The chairperson of the committee, Joan Fubbs, said the purpose of the site visit to the dti-funded companies was to assess how the funds that the department disburses are making an impact. We would like to get first-hand information from the beneficiaries themselves on how the incentives are applied, whether they achieve their objectives, as well as the challenges companies could be experiencing, said Fubbs.
