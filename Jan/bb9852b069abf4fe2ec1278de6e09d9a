Cricket South Africa (CSA) and their counterparts Cricket Australia have managed to fit in a appetising Test series of four matches in 2018. It is the first time since South Africa&#8217;s re-admission to international sport in 1991 that they&#8217;ll engage their arch-rivals in a skirmish of four matches. &#8220;This will add to the significance of the Test series and will offer us a perfect opportunity to finally win a Test series at home against the formidable Aussies,&#8221; said Haroon Lorgat, CSA&#8217;s chief executive in a statement. &#8220;Test match cricket between Australia and South Africa has always produced epic battles and brought out high-class individual performances that have become part of the annals of the game.&#8221; The series will take place immediately after India&#8217;s full summer tour. That itinerary still needs to be finalised. Australia&#8217;s tour to South Africa: 22-24 Feb 2018: SA Invitation XI, Benoni 1-5 March: 1st Test, Durban 9-13 March: 2nd Test, Port Elizabeth 22-26 March: 3rd Test, Cape Town 30 March &#8211; 3 April: 4th Test, Johannesburg For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
