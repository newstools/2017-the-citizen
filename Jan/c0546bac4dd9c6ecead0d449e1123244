For much of Tuesday s second day of the second Test between the Proteas and Sri Lanka at Newlands, you needed to be under the age of 22 to take wickets. At least that s how it felt as Kagiso Rabada (21) and Lahiru Kumara (19) combined to snaffle ten of the first 16 scalps of this match. But after that, the veteran Vernon Philander reminded everyone Test cricket isn t just a young bowler s game. The stocky seamer together with the menacing Rabada were instrumental in propelling South Africa into a commanding position at the close. Philander took 4/27 and his exciting young teammate 4/37 as Sri Lanka were shot out for just 110 after South Africa made 392 in their first innings. The tourists lost their last nine wickets for 54 runs. Faf du Plessis, the Proteas captain, decided not to enforce the follow-on as the hosts strolled to 35/0 when time was called. That s a massive lead of 317. Rabada, whose spell took him past 50 Test victims, was the initial destroyer as he merely kept things simple. His delivery to get rid of Angelo Mathews (2) was special for its extra bounce but otherwise he won t necessarily feel this was his best spell. After breaking the Sri Lankan batting order s back, it was Philander who gleefully mopped up. In the process, he has passed 150 Test wickets and will be on a hat-trick in the visitors second innings. Earlier, Quinton de Kock stroked a brilliant third Test century off only 122 deliveries. He received good support from Philander before becoming one of Kumara s six wickets. The teenaged quick truly looks an exciting prospect and has the valuable knack of producing magnificent deliveries. For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
