Heard about the man who woke up on Monday to find his car and his girlfriend missing? Magistrate Constance Nziweni heard about him on Monday, when the man in question was supposed to testify in a court case, but could not because he had no transport. The as-yet-to-be-identified man now faces arrest if he again fails to pitch on Tuesday, in a case involving Denzil Davids, accused in the Parow Regional Court of the illegal possession of a firearm and ammunition. Davids s trial, before magistrate Nziweni, was to have resumed on Monday but was instead rolled over to Tuesday due to the witness s absence. At the request of prosecutor Daniel Cloete, the magistrate authorised a warrant for the witness s arrest, but stayed execution of it until Tuesday. The prosecutor told the court that this was not the first time that the particular witness had failed to attend court proceedings. The witness had telephoned the prosecutor minutes earlier, to explain his predicament, the prosecutor said. He said the witness had worked nightshift on Sunday, and had gone to bed in the early hours, apparently with every intention of getting up in time to attend the proceedings. But it seems he had not informed his lover, asleep alongside him, that he had to go to court and, believing that he would sleep all day, she had gone to her place of employment work in his car. When he awoke, his car and his girlfriend were missing, and he had no means of getting to court, the witness explained to the prosecutor. Recalling that the witness had previously also failed to attend the case, the prosecutor had warned him to be present not later than 8.30am on Tuesday, or be brought to court under arrest.
