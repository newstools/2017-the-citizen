Johan Goosen has criminal charges hanging over his head. The 24-year-old Springbok utility back&#8217;s French club, Racing 92, have announced they&#8217;ve launched &#8220;several legal proceedings&#8221; against him for &#8220;blatant fraud&#8221;. Goosen controversially announced his retirement last month in order to return to South Africa and reportedly take up a position as commercial director at a local agricultural firm. He has done so because it is believed employment in an industry outside rugby allows him to get out of his contract without much legal consequences. Disturbingly though, Racing have lodged a criminal complaint in this regard.

Fellow French club Montpellier is reportedly keen to recruit Goosen, whilst Gloucester in England is apparently also interested in his services. Racing said Goosen &#8220;has not reported for duty for the last two days and seems to have vacated his residence&#8221;. He remains bound to the club by a contract lasting four years, the club said. His residence, company car, locker and place in the dressing room all remain at his disposal.&#8221; As a result, Racing want to go to court to recoup several payments such as image rights that were paid in advance to Goosen.
