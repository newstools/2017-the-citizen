Seven South African Police Service (SAPS) members were arrested for fraud and corruption in Ekurhuleni on Tuesday. The seven police officials, five from Rabie Ridge and two from Benoni Police Stations, were arrested by the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (the Hawks) on Tuesday morning at their respective workplaces. They allegedly submitted fraudulent travelling claims of about R50,000 between the period of March 2014 and March 2015. Gauteng MEC for Community Safety, Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane, on Tuesday welcomed the arrests, saying it would send a strong message to other officials that the province did not tolerate corruption.

This demonstrates our unwavering zeal to root out fraud and corruption, more especially in pursuit of restoring the integrity of our law enforcement agencies. We would not hesitate to act harshly to anyone who commits such crime. The Hawks spokesperson Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi was not immediately available for comment but police are currently pursuing an eighth suspect who was not at work during the time of the arrests. Nkosi-Malobane said they expected the eighth suspect to hand himself over to the police soon. She said the seven would appear in court either on Wednesday or Thursday.
