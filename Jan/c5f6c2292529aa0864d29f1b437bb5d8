Hashim Amla and his Proteas coaches, who&#8217;ll have to re-apply for their posts, are adopting a simple philosophy. They aren&#8217;t looking too far into the future. South Africa&#8217;s bearded stalwart on Tuesday once again showcased his calm nature, reassuring the local cricketing fraternity that he and the team&#8217;s mentors are fully committed to the national cause.

Some critics believe the announcement is ill-timed. &#8220;The news hasn&#8217;t affected the coaches all that much,&#8221; Amla said in Durban ahead of Wednesday&#8217;s second ODI against Sri Lanka at Kingsmead. &#8220;They&#8217;re still extremely motivated. In fact, they&#8217;ve been brilliant and professional in everything that they&#8217;ve done. It&#8217;s also important to remember that that process is still six months away. &#8220;That&#8217;s a long time in cricket. In between we have so many different challenges to keep us occupied with. There are no distractions. All parties know they&#8217;re playing for a bigger cause.&#8221; Amla himself has been the subject of speculation about his future. The 33-year-old stroke-maker had to endure a poor run of form in the past few months and shied away from media events before his 100th Test at the Wanderers earlier this month. But a century in that match as well as a decent 57 in last Saturday&#8217;s first ODI in Port Elizabeth suggests Amla is back. Interestingly, he insists he&#8217;s made no adjustments to his technique, despite numerous experts feeling he should&#8217;ve. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t changed anything,&#8221; said Amla. &#8220;That&#8217;s how it goes. You go through bad patches as a player. Many players before me, who were also far better than me, went through the same experience. &#8220;The key is patience, not about making unnecessary changes.&#8221; To calm the nerves of fans even further, Amla says people don&#8217;t have to use milestones in his career to judge whether he&#8217;s still hungry for cricket. &#8220;Whether I play 50 or 100 Tests doesn&#8217;t matter. It&#8217;s about the privilege of playing for your country.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
