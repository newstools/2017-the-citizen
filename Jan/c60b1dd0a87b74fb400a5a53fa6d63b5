Former Wits SRC president and Fees Must Fall activist Mcebo Dlamini appeared at the Johannesburg High Court on Friday morning and also shared his thoughts on the ANC succession debate. Dlamini was not in support of the ANCWL&#8217;s position that a woman should lead the country, though he pointed out a few women who were capable of leading, should it come to that. He said the best candidate should lead the ANC regardless of their gender. &#8220;There is no one who may lead the ANC. There is no one capable woman who may lead the ANC. Why reduce the debate to one particular woman?&#8221; He further suggested Minister of Science and Technology Naledi Pandor, chairperson of the National Council of Provinces Thandi Modise, former Minister of Public Service and Administration Geraldine Fraser-Moleketi and ANCYL secretary-general Vuyiswa Tulelo as women who were capable of holding the position. &#8220;Don&#8217;t reduce us to one woman, no no no, we&#8217;re not going to allow that one.&#8221; WATCH #MceboDlamini on #ANC succession debate,#Zuma&#39;s latest recent &quot;The best among us must lead -not a man not a woman-The best&quot; @JacaNews pic.twitter.com/T4GqTsMaaB &mdash; silindelo masikane (@Slindelo_M) January 13, 2017 Whoever the ruling party elects as leader must start addressing the National Health Insurance, which is there but not helping people, Dlamini said. People were dying because they could not afford proper health services and that needed to stop, he added. &#8220;If you want to take over from Zuma, start speaking about the National Health Insurance and free education, speak of the land issue, then we can engage you,&#8221; he said.

The ANCWL has been calling for Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma to take over when Jacob Zuma&#8217;s term ends, a call that has been labelled as &#8220;misguided&#8221; by the SACP. The communist party said Dlamini-Zuma&#8217;s election would turn the ruling party into a &#8220;Zuma dynasty&#8221;. Read more: SACP on Dlamini-Zuma presidency: ANC not Zuma s dynasty
