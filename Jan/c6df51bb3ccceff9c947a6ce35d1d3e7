A man was killed and three other people were injured when a Nissan Sentra overturned on the N1 about 70km from Bloemfontein on Saturday afternoon, Free State paramedics said. Paramedics from ER24 and local services arrived at the scene shortly after 4pm and found all the occupants had been ejected from the car, ER24 spokesman Werner Vermaak said. Three people had moderate injuries. One person was found with fatal injuries pinned underneath the overturned vehicle. Sadly, there was nothing that paramedics could do for him and he was declared dead on [the] scene. The three injured people were transported to Pelonomi Hospital in Bloemfontein for further care. The cause of the accident was not yet known, Vermaak said.
