The 54-year-old Portuguese boss did not disclose which club made the proposal but said he would not criticise anyone who made a highly lucrative move to the developing Chinese Super League. Last week saw Mourinho cast doubt over rhe Old Trafford future of England captain Wayne Rooney, who recently became United&#8217;s all-time leading goalscorer, by saying &#8220;the money is huge&#8221; in China, amid reports of Asian interest in the striker. &#8220;I have already refused a big offer to go to China, but I don&#8217;t criticise anyone who decides to do it,&#8221; Mourinho told the monthly GQ men&#8217;s magazine. &#8220;It&#8217;s their choice, their life. Only they can decide what they need for their future. Other managers in the Premier League have been critical, but I am no critic.&#8221; Fellow high-profile managers Luiz Felipe Scolari and Sven-Goran Eriksson are already in the Chinese Super League, while this month saw Argentina striker Carlos Tevez join Shanghai Shenhua from Boca Juniors. His arrival came a fortnight after that of Brazilian star Oscar, who joined cross-town Shanghai rivals SIPG for 50 million ($63 million, 60 million euros) from Chelsea that smashed the Asian transfer-fee record. Former Chelsea manager Mourinho said he was &#8220;worried&#8221; about the prospect of losing players to China and urged them to think about more than money. &#8220;If you are negotiating a new contract with one of your players, and you offer him 5 million per year and they offer 25 million, then you have a big problem,&#8221; Mourinho admitted. &#8220;Maybe the player takes 5 million because he prefers football. Or 25 million because he prefers money. &#8220;I am worried, because they can offer contracts that are impossible to offer in Europe. But in the end the player who wants to go is a player that maybe you don&#8217;t want to keep,&#8221; he added.
