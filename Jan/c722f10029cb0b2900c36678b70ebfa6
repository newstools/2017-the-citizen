Malvern police in Durban have condemned the theft of steel-lowering bars at freshly dug grave sites. In the wake of recent burials at the Malvern cemetery, police have noticed a rise in the reports of thieves making off with the bars, Highway Mail reported. The dead were recently dealt a grave blow. Graves had been dug up for burials but before that could happen, unscrupulous thieves crept in and brazenly stolen the steel-lowering bars at the freshly dug grave sites, said police spokesperson Warrant Officer Radhika Marimuthu. She said investigations had revealed that this crime was not limited to the Malvern cemetery. Station commmander Lieutenant Colonel Valarine Reddy appeals to residents to report anyone trying to sell these steel bars. &#8211; Caxton News Service
