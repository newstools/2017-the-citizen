The department of health has issued a warning to the public that government is not selling jobs and they should stay clear of advertisements that claim otherwise. Department spokesperson Steve Mabona said the public should not fall victim to scamsters who are fraudulently inviting people to apply for nursing, porting and general vacancies at the Dr George Mukhari Academic Hospital, north of Pretoria. He said there was an advertisement doing the rounds that there are permanent positions at the hospital for cleaners, a staff nurse, a professional nurse, an auxiliary nurse, a porter, a caregiver, general workers and laundry workers. Mabona said the ad claims to come from the hospital s human resources coordinator. When people call the contacts on the advert they are asked to deposit R2 000 to apply. We want to state firmly that vacancies in the public service are not for sale, said Mabona. None of our employees are involved in this scam. He added that the department advertises vacancies through trustworthy platforms, such as the Gauteng Online portal, the department of public service website and newspapers. MEC for health Qedani Mahlangu slated those who exploit people s desperation for employment for their own devious ends . We plead with community members not pay money for jobs in any of our facilities. Anyone approached for a job in exchange for money should report it to the police, she said.
