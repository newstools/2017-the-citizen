The Boitekong police station, near Rustenburg, lacks resources and it is situated far from the community, acting national police commissioner Lieutenant-General Khomotso Phahlane heard on Friday. The [Boitekong] police station is not accessible to the community it&#8217;s supposed to serve. It is situated in the bushes, far from the community. It is a danger to people, women are raped and people mugged on their way to the police station, said Reuben Phathaphata, a resident of Boitekong, during the national police day at Ikageng near Rustenburg. He appealed for Phahlane to provide police vehicles and to deploy more police officers to the station as the population in Boitekong had increased and the station could not cope with the growing demands. A Community Policing Forum member from Sondela informal settlement near Rustenburg said the police must raid Sondela to remove dangerous weapons. The police do not come to Sondela; they must raid that area, there are dangerous weapons used to kill people. The police only come to Sondela to pick up dead people, he said. Residents complained that Boitekong police did not respond on time or attend to complaints and they often accepted bribes. North West provincial police commissioner Lieutenant General Baile Motswenyane said 147 new police vehicles were received in the North West in December and the Boitekong police station was amongst those police stations that would receive new cars. She said a site would be identified where a police station would be built that was accessible to the community. Phahlane said a mobile police station should, in the meantime, be provided to service areas where residents were unable to go to Boitekong for services rendered by the police.
