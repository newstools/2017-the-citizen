Barca CEO Oscar Grau said on Wednesday that a new deal for Messi, who only has 18 months left on his current deal, was being negotiated with &#8220;common sense and discretion&#8221;. &#8220;With Messi what you have to do is give him a new contract, not have common sense,&#8221; said Suarez after netting his 100th Barca goal in just 120 appearances as they progressed to the quarter-finals of the Copa del Rey with a 3-1 win over Athletic Bilbao. Despite posting a record turnover of 679 million euros ($719 million) last season, a series of expensive new contracts for the likes of Neymar and Suarez mean Barcelona are close to overstepping the 70 percent limit of turnover spent on salaries imposed by UEFA&#8217;s financial fair-play laws. Barca captain Andres Iniesta also has just 18 months left to run on his contract. On the field, Messi proved the match-winner once again on Wednesday as he scored from a free-kick for the third time in as many games this year 11 minutes from time to edge out Athletic 4-3 on aggregate. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what the CEO said, but tell me one game in which Leo Messi hasn&#8217;t been decisive,&#8221; said Barca coach Luis Enrique. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know about numbers, I know about football. We all want to enjoy watching Messi here for many more years, nothing else matters for me.&#8221;
