A woman was killed in a collision between a Mercedes-Benz and a Toyota Corolla at the Hertz Boulevard and Siemens Street intersection in Vanderbijlpark early on Saturday morning, Gauteng paramedics said. Paramedics from ER24 and other services arrived on the scene shortly after 4am where they found the woman lying next to the Corolla, ER24 spokesman Werner Vermaak said. It is believed that she was ejected from the vehicle during the collision. Upon assessment, paramedics found that she sustained fatal injuries. Sadly, there was nothing that they could do for her and she was declared dead on the scene. Three other occupants from the vehicle sustained only minor injuries. They later declined to be transported to hospital. The occupants of the Mercedes were assessed but found to have no physical injuries. The cause of the collision was not yet known, he said.
