Comair said on Friday it was expecting an increase of as much as 233 percent in headline earnings per share for the six months to the end of December. The airline said the expected improvement was due to the strengthening of the rand against the US dollar, which had resulted in the reversal of unrealised translation losses on a dollar-denominated aircraft loan amounting to R98 million. Also, as disclosed in a statement on January 11, all loss-making open oil hedges had matured by the end of December 2015, and no further hedges had been entered into. The full results for the half year are expected on February 14.
