The Spain forward&#8217;s Chelsea future was called into question after he was left out of the Premier League leaders&#8217; win at champions Leicester on Saturday amid speculation he could be the subject of a colossal bid from a wealthy Chinese club. Manager Antonio Conte, however, was adamant it was injury &#8212; rather than an apparent fall-out with Costa &#8212; which prevented the 28-year-old featuring. Costa, who has scored 14 Premier League goals in 19 appearances this season, will have his fitness evaluated again ahead of Chelsea&#8217;s match at home to Hull on Sunday. &#8220;If there is a problem &#8212; and I repeat &#8216;if&#8217; &#8212; with the players then in my career I prefer to sort the problem in the changing room, not outside and not in a press conference,&#8221; said Conte on Saturday. &#8220;But I repeat &#8212; if. I have told the truth.&#8221; China says it will cut foreign player numbers in top-flight teams in a bid to curb massive spending on overseas talent. Shanghai SIPG last month broke the Asian transfer record when they paid Chelsea 60 million euros ($63 million) for the Brazilian midfielder Oscar.
