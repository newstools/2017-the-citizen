It&#8217;ll be all about survival again on Thursday. 17.50: 50 partnership between Mathews and Chandimal. It&#8217;s good to see some application. SL 119/4. 17.30: There&#8217;s a semblance of control here for Sri Lanka as Angelo Mathews and Dinesh Chandimal, their most experienced batters, resist the Proteas. Chandimal strokes a gentle loosener from Vernon Philander for four to bring up the 100. SL 103/4. 16.58: GONE! The irony. Kagiso Rabada traps Dhananjaya de Silva on the pads with a low full toss and Rod Tucker raises his finger. Given their problems with it, Sri Lanka decide not to review but replays show it was missing! SL 69/4. 16.50: WICKET! Kagiso Rabada bullies Sri Lanka into another wicket. An absolute snorter from the young quick is far too hot to the resolute Kaushal Silva to handle, who gloves it to short leg. SL 66/3. 16.17: Dhananjaya de Silva doesn&#8217;t want Keshav Maharaj to settle and strokes him for 11 runs in his first over. Sri Lanka reach 50. 15.46: GONE! The promising Kusal Mendis had looked a bit loose before the break and it leads to his downfall as he nicks Philander off to the slips. Regulation dismissal that and the tourists are in poor shape on 25/2. 15.14: That&#8217;s tea. Sri Lanka on 17/1. 15.03: OUT! Brilliant from Vernon Philander. A full inswinger has Dimuth Karunaratne driving but the movement is too much and he&#8217;s castled. Great start for the hosts. SA 11/1. 14.25: Philander hits two consecutive boundaries to take the Proteas past the magical 500-target mark. Faf du Plessis calls them in. Sri Lanka require 507 to win. 14.23: Another failed review for Sri Lanka, though to be honest, it was merely to try and give the deserving Lakmal another five-wicket haul. SA 216/7. 14.04: Wonderful pull shot from Keshav Maharaj, he&#8217;s right on top of it. The boundary brings up 200 for the Proteas. They need 18 runs to lead by 500. SA 201/7. 13.56: Quick runs for South Africa but the wickets are falling too. First, Faf du Plessis gives Suranga Lakmal a fourth before Quinton de Kock flashes at a delivery outside off. Finally, a wicket for first-innings hero Lahiru Kumara. SA 192/7. 13.23: Faf du Plessis takes the score past 150 with two crisp boundaries off Lakmal. South Africa need some impetus if they want to put Sri Lanka back in again after tea. SA 151/5. 13.15: OUT! It&#8217;s all gone a bit pear-shaped for the Proteas. Temba Bavuma misses out on a chance to regain some form as he sets off for a quick single. The fielder is quickly on to it and makes a direct hit. Bavuma dives but his bat peels off the ground. Unlucky but was the run necessary? SA 137/5. 12.32: GONE! Suranga Lakmal remains a menace. He traps JP Duminy in front with a superb yorker. An untimely wicket before lunch. SA 136/4. 12.13: Faf du Plessis&#8217; gentle edge past the slips takes the lead past 400. SA 119/3. 12.02: OUT! Two balls and Rangana Herath is in the game. Tempts Dean Elgar forward and beats him with flight. SA 110/3. 11.49: Sri Lanka miss a valuable opportunity. Excellent ball from Nuwan Pradeep traps JP Duminy on the crease but the edge flies between the two slips. That really should&#8217;ve been a catch. Next ball, Duminy is given LBW but reviews and the ball goes over the top of the bails. Good review. SA 104/2. 11.47: Lakmal&#8217;s double-strike was a false dawn. The Proteas have settled again, with Dean Elgar scoring his half-century. It&#8217;s been a brilliant Test for him. SA 96/2. 11.14: WICKET! Hashim Amla&#8217;s torment continues. Lovely delivery from Lakmal, some subtle movement away exploits the bearded talisman&#8217;s troubles outside off. The commentators say that wasn&#8217;t a weakness in his technique but tell that to the critics. SA 64/2. 11.11: GONE! Suranga Lakmal is rewarded for his determination. He targets Cook&#8217;s weakness outside off and finds the egde. SA 64/1. 10.47: Stephen Cook and Dean Elgar have bee untroubled. They&#8217;ve serenely waltzed past 50. This partnership is truly blossoming. SA 51/0. 10.30: Vernon Philander and Kagiso Rabada were relentless on Tuesday. But the veteran believes it was all down to his young teammate. 10.25: Day three at Newlands and the Proteas already lead by 317. It&#8217;s doubtful the hosts will bat too long as they really have Sri Lanka on the ropes. The bowlers would want to get stuck in again.
