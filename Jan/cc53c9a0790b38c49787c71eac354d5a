President-elect Donald Trump on Monday lashed out at screen legend Meryl Streep, accusing her of being a Hillary Clinton &#8220;flunky&#8221; after the actress berated him at the Golden Globes ceremony. Streep, a prominent Clinton supporter, blasted Trump for his divisive rhetoric as she received a lifetime achievement award at the glitzy ceremony in Los Angeles on Sunday. She also ripped Trump for the infamous campaign speech during which he did a decidedly unflattering impression of disabled New York Times reporter Serge Kovaleski. &#8220;Meryl Streep, one of the most over-rated actresses in Hollywood, doesn&#8217;t know me but attacked last night at the Golden Globes,&#8221; Trump wrote on Twitter. &#8220;She is a Hillary flunky who lost big. For the 100th time, I never &#8216;mocked&#8217; a disabled reporter (would never do that) but simply showed him &#8216;groveling&#8217; when he totally changed a 16-year-old story that he had written in order to make me look bad,&#8221; Trump wrote in a series of tweets. &#8220;Just more very dishonest media!&#8221; the president-elect added. 1994-2017 Agence France-Presse
