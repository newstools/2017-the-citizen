Fallen gospel star Sfiso Ncwane&#8217;s widow, Ayanda, visited his grave for the first time on Tuesday and shared a touching message to her husband. In an Instagram post, she shared a picture of his final resting place and said though it had been 54 days since his passing, to her it felt &#8220;like yesterday&#8221;. &#8220;I can still smell your perfume, feel your arms around me each morning. Only if there was a manual to walk this journey. Hmm.! But you said to us &#8216;Wethembekile Baba&#8217; I&#8217;ll hold on to that my love. Rest well Gwamanda, Cebekhulu, Nogandaya, Nyamakayishi, we still feel your powerful presence,&#8221; she wrote.

The illness started the night before his death at his Johannesburg home. He was then taken to hospital, where he was admitted and diagnosed with kidney failure and was later moved to the Intensive Care Unit. He unfortunately took his last breath at 9.30am Monday morning in the presence and arms of his loving wife Ayanda Ncwane. May his soul continue to rest in peace.
