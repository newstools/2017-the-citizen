There is nothing bad about the Volkswagen Golf GTI Clubsport S except for the fact that it s a limited-edition model, and all 47 models allocated for our market have been sold out. Making its South African debut today, the Clubsport S comes a few months since the Clubsport reached our shores with 195kW of power. VW has fiddled with the overblown 2.0 engine lurking under the Clubsport thus giving it 228kW of extra grunt. . Only available in Pure White with the roof painted in black, the limited edition Golf GTI Clubsport S is only available as a two-door body variant and with two seats. The South African units are only offered in Pure White with the roof painted in black. To keep the weight down, the Golf GTI Clubsport S is only available in a manual transmission. Additional components that were removed to reduce weight include rear seats, insulating material, the variable luggage compartment floor, the rear parcel shelf and bonnet damping. A smaller battery is fitted to reduce the weight further down. An aluminium subframe on the front axle and aluminium brake covers resulted in further weight savings. The outside of the car gains semi-slicks mounted on 19-inch black painted &#8220;Pretoria&#8221; alloy wheels, tinted rear windows (65% light-absorbing), &#8220;Clubsport S&#8221; type plates, the black-painted roof as well as Xenon headlights with cornering lights and LED daytime running lights. . Jumping into the cabin, each of the 400 Golf GTI Clubsport S units have its production number (001/400 to 400/400) on the ashtray cover beneath the front centre console. You get racing bucket seats, also on board are the GTI insignia featured in the standard Golf GTI Clubsport, including the iconic golf ball gear knob with Velour trim, a red line in the safety belts, Honeycomb 40 decorative inserts for the dashboard (passenger side) and door trim panels as well as elegant inserts in Piano Black for the dashboard (driver side) and centre console. Power is rated at 228kW and 380Nm of torque. All that power is accessible through a 6-speed automatic transmission. The Clubsport S features a higher top speed too and you can hit 265km/h in comparison to the 249km/h limit in the standard Clubsport. The Golf GTI Clubsport S comes standard with a 5 year/90 000km Service Plan, 3 year/120 000km warranty and a 12 year anti-corrosion warranty. Service Interval is 15 000km.
