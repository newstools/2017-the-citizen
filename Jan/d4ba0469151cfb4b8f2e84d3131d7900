Iceland could hold a referendum on joining the EU if new negotiations on forming a coalition government are successful, the head of one of the three parties involved in the talks said Monday. Elections in October in which no party won a majority were followed by weeks of failed negotiations between the conservative Independence Party and the centre-right Reform party and Bright Future. Bright Future leader Ottarr Proppe said new talks launched Monday have been more successful on the long-disputed issues of fishing and EU membership. &#8220;We have reached a certain settlement on ideas, including this one,&#8221; Proppe told public broadcaster RUV, referring to holding a referendum on whether the Nordic nation should resume its stalled EU accession process. After the economic collapse of 2008, Iceland launched EU membership negotiations in 2009 amid a perceived need for political and monetary security. But Iceland suspended the accession talks in 2013 and withdrew its EU application in a letter to the European Commission in 2015. While a majority in the nation of more than 330,000 people are against EU membership, they are in favour of holding a referendum on the issue. The latest political negotiations are the second attempt by the three parties to form a government after the October 29 election, triggered by the Panama Papers scandal. &#8220;We have crossed the biggest obstacles. Now we will use the next days to write the government&#8217;s policy,&#8221; Reform leader Benedikt Johannesson told the daily Frettabladid. &#8220;That in it itself should not take a very long time, but we are in no hurry,&#8221; he added. Talks collapsed in November when the three parties failed to find common ground over a range of divisive issues, including institutional reform, fishing and relations with the EU. &#8220;If there is something one has learnt these past two months it&#8217;s that nothing is ready until it is ready&#8221;, Proppe told RUV 1994-2017 Agence France-Presse
