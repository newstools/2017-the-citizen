The quartet consists of midfield duo, Ebenezer Ofori and Joseph Larweh Attamah, and attacking duo, Bernard Tekpetey and Raphael Dwamena. Ofori plays for Swedish side, AIK while Attamah, a member of the Ghana Under-20 team that won bronze at the FIFA Under-20 World Cup in Turkey in 2013, is on the books of Turkish side, Ba ak ehir F.K. Relatively unknown Tekpetey plies his trade with German outfit, Schalke whereas Dwamena has been banging the goals for Austria second-tier side, Lustenau. The four players were the surprise inclusion as Grant unveiled his squad to the local press on Monday in Accra, before departing for a 11-day training camp in the United Arab Emirates. There was no place for goalkeeper Fatau Dauda, who recently joined Nigeria giants, Enyimba and Leicester City left back, Jeffery Schlupp. Captain Asamoah Gyan leads the squad as he readies for his sixth successive appearance at the biennial championship. Other notable faces are Ayew brothers, Andre and Jordan; Emmanuel Agyemang Badu, Christian Atsu and Harrison Afful.
