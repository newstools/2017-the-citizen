Wenger&#8217;s contract at Arsenal expires at the end of the season and Ozil&#8217;s decision hinges on whether it is renewed or not, he told German football magazine Kicker. &#8220;The club know that I am here above all because of Arsene Wenger, who came to get me and who has placed his trust in me. The club also know that I want to have clarity first of all about what the manager is going to do,&#8221; he said. Ozil&#8217;s contract has 18 months left to run and he said he is ready to re-sign, depending on Wenger&#8217;s fate. &#8220;I am very happy playing for Arsenal and I feel very very good here. I told the club I am ready to sign extend my contract. The supporters want me here. So now it is up to the club.&#8221; Arsenal, fifth in the table behind leaders Chelsea, are still in with a chance of winning the title, he insisted. &#8220;A year ago at this stage we were top and many people thought we would be champions. Now Chelsea are in that position &#8230; But I am convinced we can still achieve our goal of being top,&#8221; he said. Ozil, 28, who has been out because of ill health for the last three Arsenal games, said the absence of a winter break in English football meant Premier League players never recovered the sharpness they had at the start of the season. &#8220;No Premier League player can claim he is as sharp as at the start of the season,&#8221; he said. &#8220;As a player you need a break, not only physically but mentally too.&#8221;
