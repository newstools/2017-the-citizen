We are indeed heartened by reports that the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) and AngloGold Ashanti have reached a groundbreaking agreement on threatened retrenchments at the mining group. Under the terms the NUM has returned to its members to report on, 800 workers are to be either re-skilled or integrated into existing AngloGold Ashanti business units. While it is far from certain that the transition will be seamless (there are all the problems associated with retraining and possible relocation and indeed, the willingness of the affected workers to accept the terms), the initiative does herald a new level of understanding between unionists and management. We suggest that a measure of give and take is far preferable than the confrontational and often violent protests, which have historically been associated with labour unrest in the mining sector. For there can be little doubt in the minds of those involved that this is a sector struggling to survive in a global economy where prices are under pressure. Industry insiders predict job losses of up to 50 000 and confrontation is the last thing it can afford. Neither can this country afford another Marikana.
