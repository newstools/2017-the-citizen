No one should be blamed, we played well and managed to create many scoring chances, sometimes there is lucky in football. We have now turned our focus on the Premier League, said Mwambusi.He said they would work on how to improve penalty taking. Yanga seem to have big problems in penalties because they rarely win matches decided by the spot shots.They were eliminated by 4-3 in the African Champions League by El Ahly of Egypt and missed a chance to qualify in group stage in 2014 edition.The team also lost 4-1 in last year s Community Shield match at the National Stadium. The club players are also known to have missed several penalties in regular time in various competitions.Meanwhile, Simba goalkeeper trainer, Idd Salim has said that they expected to win Tuesday s game even on penalties because they had already prepared for the challenge.In the match, Simba newly signed goalkeeper Danie Agyei saved two penalties to make the team qualify to the final. I am very happy to see that my goalkeeper transformed the teachings to the match and today is the hero and we are all celebrating the victory, said Salim.
