Evidence of the holiday spirit continuing into the first week of January is seen in a Facebook video showing how a group of people decided to sokkie (dance) in the rain when the road at the bottom of Oliviershoek Pass in KwaZulu-Natal was blocked by two trucks. Facebook user Sean Badenhorst posted the video on his Facebook page, stating: &#8220;Sokkie in die pad! (Dancing in the road). At the bottom of Oliviershoek Pass, we came across two truck drivers on their way up that had somehow blocked the road completely. The youngsters ahead of us didn&#8217;t get irate, they just sokkied in the rain&#8230; So South African. So cool!&#8221; The video, which was posted at 8.05pm on January 4 had already been viewed 67 000 times by Friday morning with 822 shares and 635 reactions.
