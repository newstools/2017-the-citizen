Patson Mayo commented on social media saying the incident happened in front of his house. I held the guy s hand and spoke to him while waiting for paramedics to arrive. Unfortunately he didn t make it and we are all shaken to say the least. I lost faith in humanity last night, he said. Gideon Greyling posted: Right on my doorstep, not far from me. The area is becoming more and more dangerous. I have been living in Kempton for over 30 years. This place is getting worse by the day. We need national intervention to stop this nonsense.
