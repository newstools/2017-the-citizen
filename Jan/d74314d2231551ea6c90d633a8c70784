Click here for a live scorecard. 18.02: Kyle Abbott ends the day with two boundaries off Lahiru Kumara and suddenly South Africa are just three away from 300. It&#8217;s turned out to be a pretty good day for the hosts, especially after they were reduced to 66/3. Quinton de Kock is unbeaten on 68 and will surely drive his side further on Tuesday. SA en on 297/6. 17.53: Sri Lanka really haven&#8217;t used their reviews well in this series. De Kock is clearly struck outside the line by Mathews and is duly given not out. But the Islanders insist on the review. Poor. SA 284/6. 17.35: OUT! Tired shot from Dean Elgar as he pushes at an excellent delivery from Suranga Lakmal, whose line is superb. South Africa send out Kyle Abbott as nightwatchman. Those never really work. SA 272/6. 17.31: Big moment in this game. Quinton de Kock stumbles over a gentle Mathews pacer and is given LBW. He reviews and the angle &#8211; the Sri Lanka captain is bowling around the wicket &#8211; means it&#8217;s going down leg. De Kock survives. SA 271/5. 17.25: Perfect way for Elgar to reach his highest Test scored, another superb straight drive. 100 partnership between him and De Kock too. SA 270/5 with Elgar on 129. 17.12: Sri Lanka&#8217;s spinners have been ineffectual and it&#8217;s hardly surprising that Angelo Mathews calls immediately for the second new ball. Proteas will need to be watchful for the first few overs. SA 260/5. 17.06: Quinton de Kock has reached 1000 Test runs in his 23rd innings. That&#8217;s joint fifth-fastest in South Africa&#8217;s history. He also goes to his 50 off 61 balls with a gentle late cut off Herath. SA 253/5. 16.32: Dean Elgar reaches his fifth Test hundred with a boundary. A splendid innings that has glued the Proteas&#8217; iffy effort together. SA 214/5. 16.27: It&#8217;s been streaky at times but De Kock is already on 26. It&#8217;s that tempo that puts the opposition on the back-foot. South Africa go past 200 and Elgar is 3 away from a century. SA 204/5. 16.02: Lahiru Kumara is troubling even Quinton de Kock. He traps him on the crease but the appeal for LBW fails. They review though it&#8217;s outside the line. Sri Lanka really need to work on their reviews, that was a waste. SA 173/5. 15.54: WICKET! Temba Bavuma gifts 19-year-old Lahiru Kumara another scalp. It&#8217;s a short delivery, though that&#8217;s relative given Bavuma&#8217;s height. He doesn&#8217;t quite get under the hook shot and is caught at deep square. Another dismissal South Africa will feel could&#8217;ve been avoided. SA 172/5. 15.35: Dean Elgar continues to show good attacking intent as him and Temba Bavuma take the Proteas past 150. 15.10: It&#8217;s tea. South Africa scored 78 runs in the second session so they definitely recovered but the Du Plessis wicket will be frustrating. SA 147/4. 15.01: GONE! Bit of a soft dismissal that. Herath floats one teasingly and Faf du Plessis nibbles with an expansive drive. He could&#8217;ve left that. SA 142/4. 14.46: DROPPED! Oh dear, Upul Tharanga drops a sitter! Faf du Plessis tries to attack the steady spin of Rangana Herath but only scoops it to mid-off. The chance, bafflingly, goes down. The reactions were so muted, indicating everyone&#8217;s disbelief. SA 135/3. 14.25: This fourth-wicket partnership goes past fifty. Elgar and Du Plessis really look in control. 14.02: Faf du Plessis brings up South Africa&#8217;s 100 with a superb pull shot. 13.44: Dean Elgar has batted beautifully since the break. First there was a wonderful straight drive and then brings up his 50 with a soft-handed nudge to third-man. SA 97/3. 13.25: The Sri Lankans have been a bit erratic after lunch. It&#8217;s allowed the Proteas to settle again. SA 81/3. 12.31: That was undoubtedly Sri Lanka&#8217;s session. It remains marvelous how the enthusiasm of youth can revitalise a side. Lahiru Kumara&#8217;s spell has really brought the visitors into this game. SA 69/3 at lunch. At least Dean Elgar is still there on a fine 36. 12.21: OUT! Wow, Lahiru Kumara has got some gas! Another quick delivery roughs up JP Duminy on the body and all he can do is glove it down the legside. Kusal Mendis, the stand-in skipper, takes a wonderful diving catch. The Proteas are now in a spot of bother at 66/3. 12.15: GONE! 19-year-old Lahiru Kumara castles Hashim Amla with a cracking delivery. It&#8217;s teasing, straight and quick as the bearded veteran tries an on-drive but the ball slips through the gap between bat and pad. He&#8217;s gone for 29 and the slump continues. SA 66/2. 11.56: The Proteas go past 50. A platform developing here now. 11.36: The Proteas have negotiated the first hour without much further alarm. Dean Elgar looks solid and confident but Hashim Amla is still finding his feet. The important thing is he&#8217;s still there after 45 deliveries. SA 42/1. 10.45: Dean Elgar has look reasonably solid but Hashim Amla continues to look all at sea outside off-stump. That advice from Jacques Kallis better be applied pretty soon! SA 8/1. 10.34: WICKET! Poor shot from Stephen Cook. Lovely length from Suranga Lakmal as he tempts the Proteas opener to fish outside off. Brilliant start for the tourists. SA 0/1 after just 4 balls. 10.07: Sri Lanka, in contrast, have made two changes. Upul Tharanga is an experienced top-order player who&#8217;ll be more disciplined than Kusal Perera, whilst 19-year-old quick Lahiru Kumara has been picked. He did quite well in their tour game in Potchefstroom. Sri Lanka: Dimuth Karunaratne, Kaushal Silva, Upul Tharanga, Kusal Mendis, Angelo Mathews, Dinesh Chandimal, Dhananjaya de Silva, Rangana Herath, Suranga Lakmal, Nuwan Pradeep, Lahiru Kumara. 10.06: The Proteas are unchanged: Stephen Cook, Dean Elgar, Hashim Amla, JP Duminy, Faf du Plessis, Temba Bavuma, Quinton de Kock, Vernon Philander, Keshav Maharaj, Kyle Abbott, Kagiso Rabada. 10.05: Faf du Plessis, SA&#8217;s captain, isn&#8217;t too perturbed about losing the toss, even if he wanted first bite with the ball. &#8220;It&#8217;s all about negotiating the first hour and being disciplined. We haven&#8217;t trained too much given the short turnaround, it&#8217;s all mental. We don&#8217;t want be become complacent,&#8221; he said. 10.03: Welcome to our coverage of the second Test between the Proteas and Sri Lanka. It&#8217;s an overcast day in the Mother City and Sri Lanka, understandably have chosen to bowl after Angelo Mathews won the toss. For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
