National Freedom Party (NFP) has called on Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini to fire her spokesperson, Lumka Oliphant, for her Facebook rant in which she used vulgar language to defend the minister against her critics. But Oliphant has apologised and taken full responsibility for her comments. The official trended on social media last week after she wrote a Facebook status defending Dlamini for alleged being a drunkard. She used various Xhosa terms, including challenging those who criticised the minister to etshatshalazeni, a Xhosa term used to challenge someone to an open street fight. She also used different terms insulting her boss critics.

As National Freedom Party, we suggest that the Minister of Social Development must release Lumka Oliphant, as the nation cannot be subjected to &#8220;gutter&#8221; behaviour. Her apology is unacceptable. As NFP, we consider her apology with a pinch of salt and won&#8217;t accept it, Sigudu said He said only Oliphant s removal from office would bring back lost dignity and respectability in that department and public confidence in the Minister&#8217;s ability to provide decisive leadership. Ms Oliphant cannot be trusted to continue to hold that office and recent events have proven that beyond any reasonable doubt. &#8220;She is a disgrace to all the public servants out there who uphold the oath of public service. She must go, evidently the same drunkenness alleged against her boss seems to have had an adverse effect on her recently!&#8221; Sigudu said. &#8211; ericn@citizen.co.za
