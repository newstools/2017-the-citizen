In the wake of Gauteng parents&#8217; struggle to place their children in schools, one woman, Kgoerano Umnqophiso Kekana, pulled out all the stops, breaking the law along the way, to get her younger sister into a school. To make matters worse for herself, she shared the story on Facebook, and the post reached the department of education. In her post, she told friends she applied late to the school because the decision to move her sister &#8220;came very sudden (sic)&#8221;. Even though the application was late, her &#8220;connections and influence&#8221; worked in her favour, as her sister was finally placed in a school. She went as far as mentioning officials who helped her on her mission, which was not such a good idea. Read her full post below: Kekana&#8217;s post that has been circulating on social media. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Speaking to eNCA, Gauteng education spokesperson Oupa Bodibe said the department was aware of the story and was investigating. He said they would take disciplinary action against the officials, the charges would have to be put before them, and they would have to defend themselves. The officials named could be charged with undermining the authority of the department. Also read: Man brags on Facebook about sleeping with minor, gets arrested
