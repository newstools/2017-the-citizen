A man is in a stable condition after he was bitten by a Cape Cobra at his home in Goodwood in Cape Town, Western Cape paramedics said on Saturday. When Netcare 911 paramedics arrived on the scene they found the man to be in a stable condition, Netcare 911 said in a statement on the Arrive Alive website. Paramedics began with treatment and thereafter transported the man to a nearby hospital for further medical care. This incident happened this afternoon [Saturday] while the man was busy gardening, Netcare 911 said. Snake expert Johan Marais said in the statement the Cape Cobra is an extremely dangerous cobra that will stand its ground when confronted . Bites are often fatal, with the victim dying of suffocation due to respiratory collapse. The snake had a highly neurotoxic venom, the most potent of any African cobra, he said.
