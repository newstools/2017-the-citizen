The buzz around the Sun Met, celebrated with GH Mumm, has been electric. The final field for this R5-million showdown was unveiled on Wednesday. The Sun Met will go down in history as the most lucrative day for horseracing on the continent with upwards of R22-million in stakes money offered on a day that sees Cape Town s social scene descend on Kenilworth. The Decades of Glamour theme is set to inspire a number of fantastic raceday looks spanning between the 1920s right through to the disco era of the 1970s and beyond. The official Sun Met after-party presented by GUESS has attracted a star line-up of some of South Africa s biggest artists including the likes of Mi Casa, Goodluck, Sketchy Bongo, Euphonik, Kyle Deutsch and Shekinah. Tickets for the Sun Met, celebrated with GH Mumm are available from Ticketpro here. Unsure of which horse to bet on?
