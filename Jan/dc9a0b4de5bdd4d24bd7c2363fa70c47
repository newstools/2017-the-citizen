Three people were injured, one critically, in a four vehicle pile-up on the N1 in Johannesburg on Saturday morning, paramedics said. Netcare 911 paramedics responded to a collision on the N1 north in Rivonia at about 10am, Netcare 911 said in a statement on the Arrive Alive website. . Reports from the scene indicated that three cars and a truck collided. Paramedics arrived at the scene and found a critically injured man lying in the road with life threatening injuries. Accident debris and the twisted frames of the vehicles were spread over a large area. On investigation it was found that two other people were injured, one seriously while another escaped with minor injuries. Paramedics stabilised the injured at the scene. After the critically wounded man was spinally immobilised they airlifted him with the Netcare One helicopter to a specialised hospital for the care that he required. The two other patients were transported by ambulance to various hospitals in the area for further treatment. The road remained closed while police conducted investigations. The cause of the crash was still speculative and would form part of the police investigation, the statement said.
