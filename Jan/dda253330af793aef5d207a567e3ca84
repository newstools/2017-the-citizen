Gareth Cliff has responded to reports of &#8220;fat-shaming&#8221; women earlier this week after sharing a meme on Instagram written: &#8220;In one day, Trump got more fat women out walking than Michelle Obama did in 8 years.&#8221; Cliff said the &#8220;fat-shaming&#8221; reports were just an attempt to create controversy. &#8220;It s just another form of paid Twitter,&#8221; he said. Cliff&#8217;s main problem about the reporting is the exaggeration suggesting that his meme caused a stir on social, when it only had a few comments, most of which came after the reports. &#8220;There was no social media frenzy. There was a news media frenzy among once-respected publications, who are dredging the bottom of the barrel for stories,&#8221; he said. He further defended himself, saying he only shared a meme that was created by American Senator Jack Sandlin of Indianapolis and was meant to be funny. &#8220;If it isn t funny to you, then that s all it isn t funny to you. Keep scrolling. Trolling social media comments and posing as the internet police is the laziest form of journalism possible.

The actual post on Instagram got a mere 500 likes and 90 comments [the vast majority of which came after your frenzy] and only four or five of which were critical. &#8220;The rest [including numerous comments from self-proclaimed fat women] found it hilarious. So not even the smallest minority of direct responses [not even counting the ones who don t care or are sick of made-up outrage] agree with these media publications,&#8221; he said. &nbsp;
