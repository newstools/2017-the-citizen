Midrand s Lory Park Animal and Owl Sanctuary has received its Pan African Association of Zoos and Aquaria accreditation, making it one of only six institutions in Africa to be accredited, Midrand Reporter reports. By being an accredited member, we go through a gruelling auditing process where absolutely everything is scrutinised. Auditors look at all aspects of the work done at the zoo. This includes, but is not limited to, safety, veterinary care provided for the animals, diets, husbandry, enrichment practices and all procedures put in place by the facility, said the assistant park manager, Kara Heynis.

The park was founded by Edward van Eck, who retired from his construction company to start a bird park in Midrand. The park was launched in April 2000, and many people began bringing injured and trapped animals, which eventually turned it into a sanctuary and not just a bird park. We are truly so proud and honoured to have achieved this for the second time and look so forward to continuing to build on this success, said Heynis.
