The movie will be based on the true events of former MK soldier and cash-in-transit robber Collen Chauke&#8217;s life, who died in 2003 while serving his 20-year sentence. &#8220;When Collin Chauke and his comrades returned from the MK camps in Angola, they were filled with hope at the establishment of a new, democratic country that they could call home. They were eager to see change for themselves and for their families and communities who had endured years of oppression. &#8220;When they discover that in actual fact, nothing has changed, they decide to take matters into their own hands, becoming modern day Robin Hoods. Their arrogance and &#8216;God complex&#8217; results in a number of deaths, turning them from romantic heroes to dangerous outlaws. &#8220;After escaping jail once and embarking on an even deadlier spree, Chauke is betrayed by his onetime girlfriend, Grace and lives out the rest of his short life behind bars,&#8221; reads the storyline. Congratulations to Mazwai and Modiadie on their first acting gigs, we can&#8217;t wait to see what you have to offer.
