Video recordings taken by PR strategist Sihle Bolani show how she was invited to discuss a report on the &#8216;war room&#8217; which was set up during the local government elections last year. The aim of the campaign, also dubbed &#8216;black ops&#8217; was to influence voter sentiment through social media, interviews with opinion leaders and the distribution of fake EFF and DA posters which discredited powerful figures in those respective parties. According to City Press, Bolani attended a meeting with Joseph Nkadimeng and Ignatius Jacobs, ANC general manager on November 25. In the video, Jacobs enquires about R50 million which was supposed to be raised by the &#8216;war room.&#8217; He is told by Nkadimeng the money wasn&#8217;t raised to which he replies that they are &#8216;going to be in trouble.&#8217; ALSO READ: Former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe set for finance minister position The video supports Bolani&#8217;s court papers in which she details how the &#8216;war room&#8217; worked and that it was set to achieve R50 million with the aid of companies linked to Shaka Sisulu and radio presenter Phat Joe. It also proves the ANC was informed of the campaign and Jacobs actively endorsed it. However, he was concerned the ANC would not cough up millions to the companies involved in the campaign because donor monies could have been mispent in setting up the&#8217; war room.&#8217; Now I m made out as some bad guy who was trying to create a team that must just help us with the EFF and DA in particular&#8230; Because we had teams, but this team was set up to just dig at our opponents. It did not do that, and how long have I been trying to get them to give me reports, even during the campaign? It never came.

Jacobs can also be heard saying that he was trained in propaganda and the campaign was necessary to counter white media, especially print which is perceived to be unfriendly to the government. I think the problem in this country is that the public discourse is run by white capital I know what they are capable of they are racist, they are fascist but we are not running the media space and that influences sentiment, that influences opinion If we don t change this discourse, we ll be [gone], we ll be dead, Jacobs says. Sisulu and Jacobs have since denied setting up and operating the campaign with Nkadimeng saying he volunteered his services. For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
