We are often told to live life to the fullest, but have we stopped to wonder what happens to us when we die? While Christians believe in life after death, Facebook user Samuel Murray has shared his own theory of what he thinks happens to us after we die. His post has been shared more than 130 000 times on Facebook alone, with more than 30 000 comments. Some believe in his theory, but some say he was high when he wrote his theory. He says: What if when we die the light at the end of the tunnel is the light to another hospital room, there we are born and the only reason you come out crying is because you remember everything from your past life and you&#8217;re crying at the fact that you died and lost everything, as you grow you start to forget your past life and focus on the life you have now, but patches of memory stay behind and that memory causes deja vu. Think &#8217;bout that for a second. The theory sounds much like the idea of reincarnation that is central to Hinduism, but what are your thoughts on it? &nbsp;
