For the cost of an SMS, two lucky people could win a trip to the R5 million Sun Met at Kenilworth Racecourse in Cape Town on Saturday, January 28. The prize includes airfares, two nights at a hotel, hospitality in a plush venue and thousands of rands worth of betting and clothing vouchers. The Sun Met is the richest Grade 1 race in South Africa but also on the card are three other Grade 1 races that each carry prize money of R1 million. SA s best horses will line up for the 2 000m Sun Met and one of the highlights will be the duel between Legal Eagle, the highest-rated horse in the country and 17-10 favourite, and up-and-coming Marinaresco, who ran second in last year s Durban July and is presently at 3-1. One runner who is attracting a lot of attention is grey filly Bela-Bela, trained by former champion trainer Justin Snaith. Snaith has won a lot of races but the Met has eluded him. Fillies have performed well in this race in recent years with River Jetez (2010), Igugu (2012) and Smart Call (2016) giving the boys a galloping lesson. The final field will be announced on Monday. Latest betting as supplied by Betting World is: 17-10 Legal Eagle; 3-1 Marinaresco; 9-2 Whisky Baron (Aus); 15-2 Bela-Bela; 12-1 Gold Standard; 14-1 It s My Turn; 20-1 The Conglomerate (Aus); 22-1 and upwards others.
