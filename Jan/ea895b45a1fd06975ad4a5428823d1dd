All but one of the eight illegal immigrants who escaped from a Department of Home Affairs van in which they were being transported on Thursday, have been rearrested. Police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said that police were still looking for one of the men and that the seven who were rearrested would now face criminal charges of escaping lawful custody. The immigrants, who were facing deportation, were being transported to Pietermaritzburg earlier in the day, when they made a break for it. The driver of the van, a Department of Home Affairs official, noticed two of the immigrants jumping from his van. He then drove at a high speed to try and prevent them from escaping and jumping out of the van. But when he got to the toll, he had to slow down. They all jumped out and fled. She said police had responded and that so far, one of those who had jumped from the van had not yet been arrested. They were all facing deportation, she said.
