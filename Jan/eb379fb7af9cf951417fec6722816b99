He divides opinion when he appears in the Springbok jersey and he&#8217;ll continue to do so &#8230; if Allister Coetzee still wants to use him. Morne Steyn&#8217;s representatives at the weekend confirmed the 32-year-old flyhalf hasn&#8217;t retired from international rugby as previously claimed.

Steyn reportedly said the travelling has become &#8220;too much&#8221; on his family and felt he&#8217;d struggle to break back into the national side once Handre Pollard and Pat Lambie are available. But that&#8217;s not the case. &#8220;To date, Morne has made no decision regarding his international career,&#8221; a statement from his representatives, Digidust Sport Agency, read. &#8220;His remarks merely underlined that he is aware that South Africa has two very talented flyhalves with Handr Pollard and Pat Lambie, and that naturally, as they are both younger than him. &#8220;However he keeps himself ready to serve his country and the Springboks if Allister Coetzee wishes to call him.&#8221; Steyn will never be known as one of South Africa&#8217;s more dynamic flyhalves but he is dependable. Unexpectedly handed a lifeline by Coetzee after a crisis in the No 10 jersey hit the Boks, Steyn actually provided one of the few highlights. He scored all the Boks&#8217; points in the 18-13 win over the Wallabies at Loftus &#8211; one of only four wins for South Africa in 12 Tests. That said, most fans will hope the Boks have enough local depth in 2017. For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
