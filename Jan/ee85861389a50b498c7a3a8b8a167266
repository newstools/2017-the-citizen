Nothando Nkomo Nhleko filed legal papers claiming Nhleko was not supporting their baby girl, reports weekly tabloid Sunday Sun. Instead, a source said Nhleko would buy 50 nappies and infant formula for his child, spending R500. This has lead Nothando to force him to pay maintenance as he last supported their child in September 2016. Nothando and Nhleko separated last year when the minister had her thrown out of the home they shared together. They were married traditionally.

Nathi has abused that woman. He forced her to quit her job and then a year after into their marriage he started humiliating her in public,&#8221; the source said. Nhleko denied he had not supported his child, saying he was not aware of the court matter. For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
