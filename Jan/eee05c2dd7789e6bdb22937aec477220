Zahara has been ridiculed on social media before, and today she took some flak again for posting a picture of herself copying a pose by Beyonce. Many of her fans, however, saw the humour in it. As we gaze into the future all praise to the most high Zee and Bee #countrygirl A photo posted by Bulelwa Mkutukana (@zaharasa) on Jan 2, 2017 at 5:55am PST In the middle of last year, the award-winning singer was mocked for posting a picture of herself wearing similar attire to Kim Kardashian daughter, North West, and asking who wore it best? , and then for posting a picture on Instagram in which she wore a blue tracksuit and heels, similar to Rihanna s, asking the same question. . . When she took to social media to showcase her African attire in celebration of Africa Day 2016, she was poked fun at for being in a crawling position for no apparent reason.
