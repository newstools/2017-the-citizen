While it would be every golf enthusiast s dream to play with the second best golfer in the world Rory McIlroy the premier of Gauteng David Makhura did not make his 6.30am Pro-am tee time in the SA Open at Glendower Golf Club on Tuesday. McIlroy was left waiting when the field teed off promptly on time in the early morning, but the four-time Major winner was forced to carry on without Makhura. The rest of the fourball were present and McIlroy played with his amateur partners Tim Abbott and Mark Wilson. It is unclear why Makhura failed to arrive, and the Sunshine Tour had not been told why he could not make it. McIlroy after his round said he had heard the premier had a busy schedule. We got around a bit quicker so it was okay. I m not really up with South African politics but I hear he had a busy schedule. I think he delivered his last speech a couple days ago, said McIlroy. The Northern Irishman is the only player in the top 40 in the world rankings in the field and will be the heavy favourite for the tournament which starts on Thursday.
