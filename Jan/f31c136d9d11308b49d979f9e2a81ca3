Apparently, according to anonymous gossip tabloid writer Shwashwi, TV and radio personality Anele Mdoda needs to do the right thing and slim down a little. Shwashwi wrote a comment about Pabi Moloi, who recently gave birth, and Zoleka Mandela, who has cancer and still manages to exercise, and asked Mdoda what her excuse was. Shwashwi&#8217;s comments unleashed a lot of criticism from people who said the comments were &#8220;unnecessary&#8221; and &#8220;disgusting&#8221;. &#8220;If they did their research they&#8217;d know that @Anele is pro-fitness, it&#8217;s 2017 can they leave body shaming in a coffin and let women rest,&#8221; said one Mmane Boikanyo. Some said Shwashwi should have encouraged a healthy lifestyle without offending anyone. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think Anele owes anyone anything, she is beautiful and comfortable in her skin. People need to stop body shaming,&#8221; they said. One of Mdoda&#8217;s followers saw the article and alerted it to her, a move that seemed to have annoyed her. &#8220;Please don&#8217;t tag me on trash,&#8221; she said.
