We know that Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leaders give credit where it&#8217;s due when it comes to music. The party&#8217;s national spokesperson and the People&#8217;s Bae, Mbuyiseni Ndlozi, has given a shout out to Bongekile &#8216;Babes Wodumo&#8217; Simelane for her &#8220;true&#8221; music that he says has defied race. Taking to Twitter on Saturday, Ndlozi shared a video of a young white boy who seemed to have taken a break from a soccer game with his friends at a field, just so he could sing and dance to Babes Wodumo&#8217;s Wololo. The young boy can be seen dancing with a &#8216;Babes Wodumo&#8217; attitude as he sings the correct lyrics. &#8220;When @BABESWODUMO has captured the imagination of so young a white kid: we must salute her!True music really defies race: ask Bob Marley,&#8221; said Ndlozi. The video was posted on Twitter by the Wololo hit maker&#8217;s rumoured bae, Mandla Maphumulo, popularly known as Mampintsha, with the caption: &#8220;This will forever happen with this song&#8221;.

Malema has previously taken to Twitter to compliment Mabala Noise s Major League DJs and said their music was proper . Boys and Boys, the problem is Mabala Noise, he said. The record label made headlines in the past few months after signing many artists, including the DJs, Khanyi Mbau and Nasty C, to name a few. The move shocked South Africans who wondered what was so special about the label and why artists would want to sign with them. Read more: Mabala Noise music is proper Malema
