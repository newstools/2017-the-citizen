Some might disagree but Leinster and Ireland flyhalf Jonny Sexton is adamant former Springbok Frans Steyn isn&#8217;t a dirty player. Sexton was at the receiving end of a sickening blow from a high tackle that led to the enigmatic utility back, who plays for Jake White at the French club Montpellier, being sent off with a red card. World Rugby, the sport&#8217;s governing body, only recently announced stronger punishment for any illegal tackling. Yet even though Sexton was left dazed for a few moments, he defended his opposite number following Leinster&#8217;s massive 57-3 win. &#8220;I know Frans well and he&#8217;s a good guy,&#8221; Sexton told Sky Sports afterwards. &#8220;It looked like I was ducking down into it a little bit so it could have been accidental. But with these new laws, I suppose you can&#8217;t afford to be reckless. &#8220;It probably was a yellow card before, now it&#8217;s a red. And I felt for him because he&#8217;s not a dirty player and it was probably accidental.&#8221; Also read: WP&#8217;s move for SP Marais spells bad news about Cheslin Kolbe The loss was also a depressing way for White, a former Springbok coach, to end his European campaign with Montpellier. He&#8217;ll be leaving the team at the conclusion of the current season. For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter. &nbsp;
