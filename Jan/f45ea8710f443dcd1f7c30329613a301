South Africa won&#8217;t have high-profile representation at this year&#8217;s Australian Open. Kevin Anderson, local tennis&#8217; leading men&#8217;s player, on Monday announced he has been forced to withdraw from 2017&#8217;s first Grand Slam tournament due to his ongoing hip problem. &#8220;Unfortunately, I&#8217;ve made the very tough decision to withdraw from the Australian Open this year,&#8221; the 30-year-old wrote on Twitter. &#8220;I&#8217;m very sad to be missing one of my very favourite events each season.&#8221; Anderson had a torrid 2016, battling an ankle and shoulder injury before briefly returning only to pick up his latest affliction. His lack of match fitness and form has seen him slump from a career-high world ranking of 10th to 67th. &#8220;I&#8217;m still recovering from an injury sustained last year but things are looking much better and I&#8217;ll be back in competition soon,&#8221; Anderson wrote. &#8220;I hope all the fans and players enjoy the tennis (Down Under) this year.&#8221; He hasn&#8217;t really tasted much success in the tournament anyway, with the fourth round being his best finish to date. The Aussie Open starts on Thursday. For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
