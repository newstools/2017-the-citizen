If the South African Rugby Union (Saru) had hoped to rope in wise heads to assist Allister Coetzee with the Springboks, they can&#8217;t count on Brendan Venter. The former Bok centre, renowned as one of the best thinkers in the game, on Monday signed a two-year contract with Italy. Venter will be in charge of the Azzurri&#8217;s defence until 2019&#8217;s World Cup in Japan. Also read: Allister Coetzee will only know his fate in January It&#8217;s a role he&#8217;s already used to, having been approached last year to assist them in preparing for the match against the Springboks. Italy historically won that game by 20-18. Venter was the facilitator of last year&#8217;s coaching indaba in Cape Town, where Saru assembled various prominent local coaches to discuss the Springboks&#8217; failings. &#8220;I played and worked with Brendan at London Irish in the past and I believe that this agreement is the best it can be for us and for him,&#8221; Conor O&#8217;Shea, the head coach, told the Italian Rugby Federation&#8217;s website. &#8220;Brendan has had a great impact on the squad and on our defence. We are excited to be working with him for years to come. He&#8217;s a coach who is respected by the whole international rugby scene and we are proud that he wants to join our project with Italy.&#8221; The news will frustrate local rugby fans as Saru continue to discuss the suitability of Coetzee as the national side&#8217;s head coach. While rumours of Rassie Erasmus&#8217;, Saru&#8217;s former director of rugby, return to South Africa from Ireland continues to swirl, it would seem more realistic to expect the governing body appointing experienced assistants to help Coetzee. Saru&#8217;s tight financial position is reportedly preventing them from ending Coetzee&#8217;s contract prematurely. Yet recruiting help is a difficult task as local rugby is currently experiencing a dearth of established, world-class coaches. Venter&#8217;s unavailability is a further blow.
