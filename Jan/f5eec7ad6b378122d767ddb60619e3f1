The first two races look competitive so we ll kick it off in Race 3, a FM Maiden Plate over 1 400m where the combination feature with Beach Bird. This four-year-old daughter of A P Answer has improved over her last two starts. She ran on well last time out so the 1400m trip should be right up her alley. Biggest danger could be ultra-consistent Green Report. Beach Bird shoulders 60kg and jumps from a No 2 draw which should heighten her chances. Up next, Muzi is aboard Giveuwings in Race 4 another Maiden Plate over 1400m. This four-year-old son of Toreador is long overdue that first career victory and has been a rather expensive to follow. He shoulders 60kg and jumps from a wide No 14 draw, but has the class to overcome it and faces a modest field so could end his drought here. He s very talented but will have to behave. He was unruly at the start a run back when refusing to jump out the gates. Corrie and Muzi team up again in Race 5 a Pinnacle Stakes over 1400m. Secret Lover impressed in his last start when making light work of his opposition to win by 4.75 lengths. Much is in his favour; he jumps from No 1 draw and shoulders a modest 53.5kg which should increase his chances. Secret Lover steps up in class and faces a lot stronger however a number of runners are held on form by this Lensley-trained five-year-old. He s defeated Ford Country by nine lengths and Shades Of Silence by 35 lengths. He could afford Muzi and Corrie a hat-trick of wins on the day. Secret Lover s biggest danger will be Pigeon Flyer who was caught on the post by Western Force last time out. Both runners are more than capable of running away with this race should Secret Lover fluff his lines.
