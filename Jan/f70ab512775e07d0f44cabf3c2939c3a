Put down those cellphones! That is the message of renowned South African sports scientist, Dr Sherylle Calder, to the England rugby team. Calder, who was a consultant for Jake White&#8217;s World Cup-winning Springbok side in 2007, is currently in Britain as the Roses&#8217; visual awareness coach.

We all do, don&#8217;t we,&#8221; Calder told BBC Radio 5. &#8220;And elite players more than others because they have more spare time.&#8221; Visual awareness is especially important at senior-level rugby, where space on the field for attacking play is severely limited. &#8220;You&#8217;re really looking in onto a small little screen,&#8221; said Calder. &#8220;If you think about what they do on this huge field, having to make decisions on what they see, it&#8217;s not ideal to do that.&#8221; But her biggest gripe is the lack of concentration the players eventually develop.

One of the skills that is really deteriorating is the ability to concentrate and that&#8217;s probably one of the first skills any coach asks of a player,&#8221; said Calder. &#8220;Because we&#8217;re in distraction mode all the time and the phone has a role to play in that, that ability to concentrate has deteriorated.&#8221; While it&#8217;s unlikely that head coach Eddie Jones will issue a blanket ban on the use of phones, Calder hopes the English player limit their use in the build-up to the upcoming Six Nations tournament. &#8220;We would advise them closer to competition on what they should be doing, what habits and behaviours to have,&#8221; she said.
