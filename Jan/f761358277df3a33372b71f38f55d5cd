This pain tends to be worsened by physical activity.Some people can tell when they are about to have a migraine because they see flashing lights, zigzag lines or they temporarily lose their vision prior to migraine.Although the exact cause of migraine is unknown, researches show that migraines are due to a mixture of environmental and genetic factors.Change in hormone levels may also play a role, as migraines are three times more common in women than men.Some people who suffer from migraines can clearly identify triggers or factors that cause the headaches.
