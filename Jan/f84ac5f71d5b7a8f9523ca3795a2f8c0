Dodoma. The regional agricultural officer, Mr Abramu Isack, has said the drought being experienced in Dodoma suggests there will be no farming this year.He said lack of rains herald food shortages and there s a possibility that hunger will strike the region in the next few months.However, he said the little rains falling in some days can support only crops that withstand drought.He therefore urged farmers to grow cassava and millet. The situation has so far proven that there will be no farming this time round and thus, it is wise for the farmers to engage in other income generating activities, things are going to be worse here, he told The Citizen during an interview last weekend.According to the 2016/17 National Food Production and Security report issued by the ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries, Dodoma is among the regions with high indicators of starvation.Dodoma is amongst semi-amid regions which get few rains annually.Lack of rains and food has resulted to increasing malnutrition amongst children.According to the Tanzania Demographic Health Survey (TDHS) 2012, micronutrient deficiency in the region was high amongst women of child-bearing age, with 40 per cent anaemic, 36 per cent iodine deficient, 30 per cent iron deficient and 37 per cent vitamin A deficient.With only 1,328,757 out of 2,699,217 hectares of the region s arable land under cultivation, the semi-arid condition places the region amongst those will a high risk of experiencing hunger.In the meantime, the ambitious plan by the government to relocate to Dodoma adds more problems.The move is likely to put the regional authority in a litmus test as the shift is expected to come with at least 3 million people, which means there will be additional demand for food in the next few months.
