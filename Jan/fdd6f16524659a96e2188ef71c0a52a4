Gauteng s MEC of community safety, Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane, on Wednesday commended patrons of Clearwater Mall in Johannesburg for achieving an incident-free festive season. The department of community safety spokesperson, Thapelo Moiloa, said this achievement was due to the high visibility of the SA Police Service, community patrollers, Gauteng traffic police officers and Metro police officers. Police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Mack Mngomezulu said Clearwater Mall was one of the safest around Gauteng. This was revealed when interacting with over 30 patrons during the mall activations today [Wednesday], where law enforcement agencies shared safety tips and encouraged them to help strengthen community intelligence through joining street and block communities as well as broadening the intelligence network by registering as informers, said Moiloa. It is our desire to collaborate with patrons and all other law enforcement agencies in a bid to ensure safety for shoppers. Shopping malls are meant to be a crime-free environment where patrons could feel free to walk, do business and shop without fear, he said. Moiloa said there were more awareness campaigns being planned, which would include targeting places of interests such as taverns, parks and informal settlements located along major highways, as pedestrian safety remains a key. He alleged that Gauteng recorded a figure of 106 pedestrian fatalities over the festive season period alone. Moiloa said the majority of these pedestrian fatalities were attributed to drinking and walking, crossing roads unsafely, walking with headphones and not wearing reflective clothing en route from places of entertainment.
