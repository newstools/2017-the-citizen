A New Zealand Breakers basketballer whose eyeball popped out of its socket mid-game is staging a miracle recovery and should play again soon, the club said Friday. US import Akil Mitchell was on the attack against the Cairns Taipans in Auckland on Thursday night when he caught an accidental finger in the eye from an opposing player. **Warning: Graphic content ** Television footage showed the 24-year-old writhing in agony on the ground holding his hands to his left eye as horrified teammates tried to help. Mitchell was rushed to hospital and the Australian National Basketball League (NBL) later said his eyeball had been relocated in its socket and he had been sent home. Breakers general manager Dillon Boucher said it appeared Mitchell had full vision in the affected eye although there could be some minor muscular damage to the socket. He said the North Carolina native could return for the Breakers as early as this season, although he would probably need to wear eye protection. To be honest it feels like a miracle, Boucher told Radio Sport. He s actually doing really well and got discharged from hospital last night. He obviously went away with a pretty horrific injury and we feared the worst&#8230; we&#8217;re so happy he was able to be sent home. After being discharged, Mitchell himself tweeted a cartoon of a pair of eyeballs, along with the words &#8230;too soon? &#8220;Lol thanks for all the love, well wishes, and prayers tonight. I&#8217;m home and seeing fine, more tests tomorrow, he added. Mitchell s shaken teammates resumed the game after the incident, losing 94-81, although Boucher said the result felt insignificant after his player s injury scare.
