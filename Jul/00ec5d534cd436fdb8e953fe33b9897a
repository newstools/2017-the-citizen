Bull Valley, winner of the Tsogo Sun Sprint at Scosville in May, will be looking for his second successive Grade 1 victory when he lines up in the Mercury Sprint over 1200m at Greyville on Saturday 15 July. The four-year-old son of Toreador has drawn beautifully at barrier No 4 for this R800,000 race and is one of three runners entered from the mighty Sean Tarry yard. Bull Valley was well supported to win the Grade 1 Tsogo Sun Sprint where he was backed in from 10-1 to go o at 6-1 and was joint second favourite behind Attenborough who finished unplaced. However, Tarry has also entered talented Trip To Heaven, probably the best sprinter in this country not to have won a Grade 1 race. In fact, he was first past the post in last year s Gold Challenge over 1600m but was relegated to second place after the stipes believed he caused interference to Mac De Lago. Trip To Heaven would surely have won a couple of Grade 1 events but for his untidy starting habits where he usually gives the eld a couple of lengths as they jump. He could get it right in this event although he has drawn at No 10 but could come in substantially. Tarry s third entry is Captain s Causeway who ran a decent four- length fourth behind Search Par- ty in the Grade 2 Post Merchants over this course and distance last time out. Talktothestars ran h in this race last year and for a while lost his form. However, he showed a return to best form when second to Rafeef in the Grade 1 Computa- form Sprint and then also put up a great effort when beaten a neck by Search Party in the Post Mer- chants. Unfortunately Coenie de Beer s runner has drawn wide at No 18. Riverine represents the Mike Azzie yard and he bounced back with a win in a Pinnacle Stakes at Turffontein last month. He has drawn well at No 8. There are two llies among the entries Candice Bass-Robinson s Live Life and Grant Maroun- trained Wrecking Ball. Unfortu- nately both have them have land- ed wide draws at No 19 and No 17 respectively. Supplementary entries closes at 11am on Friday with declara- tions closing at 11am on Monday, 10 July.
