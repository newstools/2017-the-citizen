The Toyota Aygo is synonymous with both style and originality. Its famous colour scheme, characterised by the familiar Piano Black used for the X dominating the car s front end, is a true sight to behold. Although oozing copious amounts of chutzpah and character already, Toyota South Africa Motors was still not done with the Aygo, and has now introduced the new Aygo X-Cite to the model lineup. Other models include the Aygo and Aygo X- Play Black. The X-Cite offers South African buyers the option of an affordable, open-top compact hatch with its retractable canvas roof model. Finished in black, the full-length X-Cite canvas roof is factory-fitted and electrically-operated with a switch next to the map light control in the headlining. The full length retractable roof also ensures that even those travelling in the rear seats also get to enjoy some of the wind-in-thehair experience. The familiar 1.0-litre VVT-i petrol engine will animate the Aygo X-Cite, combined with a manual The sky is the limit transmission. The X-Cite also comes standard with Vehicle Stability Control, LED daytime running lights, 15-inch alloy wheels, SRS Airbags (Driver +Passenger +Side +Curtain) and short pole Antenna.
