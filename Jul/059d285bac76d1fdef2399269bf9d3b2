A former MTN s accountant s assets have been frozen, Sandton Chronicle reports. Brandon Ruth Mohabane, accused of allegedly defrauding MTN of more than R23 million, appeared briefly before Magistrate Brian Nemavhidi at the Johannesburg Specialised Crimes Court on 20 June. Her case was postponed to 1 August for further investigation, but the accused is embroiled in another legal battle with the National Prosecuting Authority s (NPA) Asset Forfeiture Unit. Moshabane has subsequently fired the lawyer who represented her during the bail hearing. Her new legal counsel, Pierre Smit, said they would be in the high court on 18 July to challenge the freezing of his client s assets.

At the time of her arrest in April, Moshabane was employed as an accountant for MTN, a position that she held from 2003. Smit asked the court to extend Mohabane s bail of R200 000, as his client has been complying with all bail conditions, which included visiting her local police station twice a week.
