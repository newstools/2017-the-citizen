The 30-year-old was invited to share her top 10 hits on Kaya FM&#8217;s mid-breakfast show with T-bose. Her interview led to a discussion on mental awareness and a hashtag that had been created on social media by Kaya FM, titled &#8216;I&#8217;m in love with a mental&#8217;. T-bose then asked Bonang if she had ever experienced such a relationship. She responded that she had been in a relationship with a person who was very controlling. Though she did not say who this was, she has previously implied it could be Euphonik. You were nothing but good to me therefore to this day I have nothing ill to say about you after you was bullsh*t and now I m okay she told Slikour taking an apparent jab at Euphonik. She said on Kaya FM: &#8220;In love with a mental, it sounds nice, but it&#8217;s not nice. I have been in a relationship where that other person becomes so in control that you sort of crumble and you lose parts of yourself. &#8220;You lose parts of how you feel. Love is not meant to hurt. When you are in that situation, you don&#8217;t realise it until you step out of it. &#8220;It&#8217;s easy to be standing on the outside and screaming and shouting at people who are in certain situations, but you don&#8217;t necessarily understand the intricate details of why they are there. Maybe they cannot get out of it or stay, whatever it is,&#8221; she commented during the interview.
