The department of energy announced its expected drop in the fuel prices on Saturday, which will kick in this Wednesday. Hard-hit consumers can expect some relief at the pumps, with 93 octane petrol costing 69 cents less, and 95 octane decreasing by 68 cents. The wholesale price of both grades of diesel 0.05 percent sulphur and 0.005 percent sulphur would decrease by 60c/l. The wholesale price of illuminating paraffin would drop by 57c/l and the single maximum national retail price (SMNRP) by 76c/l. The maximum retail price for LPGAS would drop by 91c/kg. The decreases were due to the average international product prices of petrol, diesel, and illuminating paraffin decreasing during the period under review (June 2 to June 29). The rand also appreciated against the US dollar during the period under review, on average, when compared to the previous period, the department said.
