Nomzamo Mbatha looked sexy and chic in a metallic suit. &nbsp; Made in Africa. I met this girl a month ago. She&#8217;s stronger, more resilient and confident. She is not afraid of the sound of her voice. Or the beat of her drum. #IsThisTooMuch#l #BlackGirlMagic #BlackGirlsRock &#x1f4f8;: @bongigumede1 @ubuhle_media A post shared by Nomzamo Mbatha &#x1f1ff;&#x1f1e6; (@nomzamo_m) on Jul 8, 2017 at 11:24pm PDT 6.
