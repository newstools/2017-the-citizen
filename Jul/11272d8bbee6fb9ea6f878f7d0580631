Sri Lanka is to deploy game wardens to stop wild elephants straying onto the pitch when the country hosts Zimbabwe for a series of one-day internationals at the Hambantota stadium. Experts will be on hand for all three ODI games at the 35,000-capacity stadium, which is next to an elephant sanctuary, a wildlife official said on Monday. The stadium was built in 2009 under former president Mahinda Rajapakse, who was from Hambantota, but has hosted only a handful of matches because of its remote location and high maintenance costs. &#8220;There had been a few instances when elephants broke through the fence and invaded the pitch at night,&#8221; said the official, who asked not to be named. &#8220;A jungle patch starts about 100 metres from the stadium and we are deploying 10 wardens to make sure that fans don&#8217;t stray into that area and provoke the elephants.&#8221; He said there was a herd of about 25 elephants roaming the area, 240 km south of Colombo, posing a potential threat to fans. It is not the first time wildlife has disrupted games at Hambantota &#8211; swarms of wasps that have taken up residence there have also caused problems. The last ODI played at Hambantota was two years ago. Following a recent refurbishment, Sri Lanka Cricket scheduled the final three ODI matches against Zimbabwe at Hambantota. The games will decide the series winner after the two sides notched a victory each in the first two games played at Galle. For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
