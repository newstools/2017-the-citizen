A seven-year-old girl is missing after being swept of rocks in rough sea conditions at Betty s Bay, east of Cape Town on Friday afternoon, the National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) said. NSRI Hermanus duty crew were activated just after 4.30pm on Friday following reports of a seven-year-old girl missing after being swept off rocks by waves on the coastline at Betty s Bay, NSRI Hermanus station commander Deon Langenhoven said. Our NSRI Hermanus rescue vehicle towing our sea rescue craft Jaytee III was dispatched and launched on the scene in very rough sea conditions with a rising spring tide in 4.8 metre swells. NSRI Gordon s Bay were activated and the NSRI Gordon s Bay sea rescue craft Jack &amp; Irene was launched and joined in a search operation, he said. Overberg fire and rescue services and the Western Cape government health emergency medical services (EMS) ambulance and rescue squad also responded. An extensive shore and sea search has revealed no sign of the seven-year-old female who is missing after being swept off rocks by waves. Rough sea conditions hampered the search operation. The missing child was with her mom when the incident happened. A police dive unit was alerted and NSRI Hermanus and police divers continued an ongoing search operation on Saturday. The family, from Claremont in Cape Town and believed to be on a weekend getaway at Betty s Bay, were receiving assistance, Langenhoven said.
