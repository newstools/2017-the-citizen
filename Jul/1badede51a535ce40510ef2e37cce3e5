Sipho Charles Ndlovu, known by his fans as Brickz, was on Friday found guilty of rape by the Roodepoort Magistrates Court. Magistrate John Baloyi said the Kwaito star was guilty as charged after failing to convince the court he did not commit the crime, Sunday World has reported. Brickz s R50 000 bail was reportedly revoked, and the star was led to the holding cells, where he will remain in custody until his sentencing. Sentencing is expected to take place next week. The 32-year-old musician was arrested in 2013 after allegedly raping a teenage relative at his home in Honeydew, Johannesburg. City Press reported it was the Kwaito star s wife, Nqobile Ndlovu, who reported him to the police after she noticed the girl acting strangely. A source close to the investigation told the newspaper the teenager was a regular visitor to Brickz s home in Ruimsig. The state s case apparently includes the allegation that Brickz entered a bedroom where the girl was eating her lunch. He allegedly pushed her on to the bed, raped her then threatened to kill her if she told anyone. According to City Press, Nqobile questioned the girl when she started acting strangely, and the teenager eventually revealed the Kwaito star had raped her. Both Nqobile and the girl s father reportedly went to the police station to report the crime. During one of his court appearances, his representative had said the case against his client was weak and filled with holes . Also read: After spending R2m on drugs, Brickz makes a comeback
