According to tabloid Sunday Sun, rapper AKA, real name Kiernan Forbes, is getting serious enough to want to propose to his longtime girlfriend Bonang Matheba. The two recently lived it up in high style for her 30th birthday. Sunday Sun sources claimed that AKA has been phoning various jewellery stores in hopes of getting a top engagement ring made in return for publicity on his social media pages. So far, apparently, no jewellery maker has felt sufficiently enticed to give him a ring for free or offer a discount on it. The paper also reported that the two have moved in together. Both of the star&#8217;s managers were not ready to say that an engagement is about to happen soon, merely that an announcement of some sort is coming and they don&#8217;t want to &#8220;spoil things&#8221;.
