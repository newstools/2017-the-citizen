Fear the New Zealand factor, Lions. That is former Springboks flyhalf Joel Stransky&#8217;s stark warning to Johan Ackermann&#8217;s troops as they prepare for Saturday&#8217;s Super Rugby semifinal against the Hurricanes at Ellis Park. Also read: Super Rugby: Elton Jantjies knows he must do better It&#8217;s been pretty smooth sailing for the Lions in this year&#8217;s tournament after they topped the overall log and only lost once. But they haven&#8217;t played against a New Zealand team once. And that&#8217;s a concern for Stransky. &#8220;I&#8217;m really concerned that they haven&#8217;t played any New Zealand teams yet,&#8221; he told Radio Sport in New Zealand. &#8220;The Sharks were very clever in the way they applied pressure and went about things in last weekend&#8217;s playoff. The Hurricanes would certainly have learned from that.&#8221; The Lions were indeed discomforted by the Durbanites&#8217; abrasive tactics in a narrow 23-21 victory and at times seemed to lack the flexibility to deal with it. Compounding the situation is the fact that the Hurricanes possess a man with a keen understanding of South African rugby: assistant coach John Plumtree. He was a very successful head coach of the Sharks from 2008 to 2013. Also read: LOOK! This is how the Lions photobombed us! &#8220;John Plumtree would have studied that inside out, knowing the Sharks and Lions very well. The Hurricanes coaching team are very smart,&#8221; said Stransky. &#8220;They&#8217;ll have picked out what Sharks did really well, where weak points are. I&#8217;ve got this horrible feeling Hurricanes might come here and win. It&#8217;s going to be a really tough game for the Lions.&#8221; What should give the Lions hope though is that they managed to win two very testing playoff games in 2016&#8217;s edition &#8211; against the Crusaders and Highlanders. Yet are they &#8220;out of practice&#8221; against New Zealand teams perhaps? Stransky&#8217;s answer is simple. &#8220;If you&#8217;re not playing the best teams, like the Chiefs, Hurricanes, Crusaders and Highlanders you&#8217;re not testing yourself. &#8220;You&#8217;re not stepping up when it matters and when you do have to play those teams in a one-off knockout game it&#8217;s going to be very tough. You have to catch up with the pace of game, style of play and different set of pressure that comes your way.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
