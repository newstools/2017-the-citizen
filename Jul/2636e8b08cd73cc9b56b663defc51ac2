In a statement by the presidency late on Saturday, President Jacob Zuma and Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa expressed sadness at the death of Ronnie Mamoepa, who passed away in Pretoria on Saturday at 11.15pm. Zuma and Ramaphosa have conveyed their sincere condolences to Mamoepa&#8217;s immediate and extended family, comrades, friends and colleagues. Mamoepa (56), a former political prisoner and member of the Gauteng provincial legislature, was a highly regarded and accomplished public servant and veteran communicator who served in the ANC and various departments in government. In his latest role, since 2014, Mr Mamoepa served as spokesperson for the deputy president. &#8220;This is a great loss to me personally, to the presidency and government at large,&#8221; said Ramaphosa. &#8220;However, our thoughts are firstly and foremost with Ronnie&#8217;s wife, Audrey, his children and his siblings. I offer my sincere condolences to Ronnie&#8217;s relatives, friends, comrades and colleagues who have suffered the loss of someone who was much loved and respected across our country and beyond. We shall miss him greatly.&#8221; Ramaphosa, who visited Mamoepa in hospital several times during his illness, expressed his appreciation to the management and staff of Unitas Hospital as well as other medical professionals who attended to Mamoepa for their sustained efforts to make Mr Mamoepa comfortable during his extended illness. Details of memorial events were to be made known as soon as they are finalised with the Mamoepa family. &nbsp;
