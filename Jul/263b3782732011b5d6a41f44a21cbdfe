In the macho way we bring up boys to play sport, the biggest dig you can use to inspire them is to tell them: You re playing like a girl. After the Proteas women s team went down fighting on Tuesday in the ICC Women s World Cup semifinal, we would suggest, without wanting to be facetious, that perhaps if more of our national sporting teams emulated these women, we d be doing a lot better on the international stage. Women s cricket in this country has gone, in a single tournament, from being a curiosity and pub chuckling point for the boys, to a sporting code we can all be proud of. And as Cricket SA chief executive Haroon Lorgat noted, that the Proteas women came so close they went down to the second-last ball of the 50-over innings against England was a heartbreaking defeat for the team and their supporters. A few years ago, we would not have dreamed of being able to compete with England, one of the world s top sides, let alone push them right to the wire in a tournament semifinal. This is a victory for the team, a victory for South Africa and a victory for sportswomen in our country. They ve earned their respect.
