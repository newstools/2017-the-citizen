The SABC has issued a statement after Marawa repudiated his contract with the SABC following a fall-out between the two parties last month. &#8220;SABC Sport has accepted his decision to repudiate his contract with the SABC, which he entered into with SABC Sport on the 6th of June 2017. The SABC engaged Marawa several times to try and remedy the situation. &#8220;Sully Motsweni, Group Executive: Sport stated: Mr. Marawa contributed immensely to the Sport brand within the organization, especially on radio station Metro FM. It was hard for us to accept but we concede to his decision. Marawa tweeted that he would no longer present his radio show in solidarity with his producer, Beverly Maphangwa who was suspended for playing content from SuperSport. The audio clip was of Sizwe Mabena and played during Marawa&#8217;s Metro FM radio show. He added that until Maphangwa&#8217;s suspension was lifted and she resumed his duties, he would be off the air. 1)My Producer Beverly Maphangwa has been suspended 4 &quot;non-compliance/contravention of contract.&quot;The crime?

Marawa said he was unaware of the meeting and was not fazed by the possibility of being fired. He stated the SABC had partnership agreements with its competitors and Maphangwa hadn&#8217;t violated any rules by playing the content. READ MORE: Wedding is off!
