Proteas stand-in skipper Dean Elgar believes Kagiso Rabada&#8217;s ban from the second match of the England series is a &#8220;big loss for Test cricket&#8221; and not just the team. The tourists suffered a thumping 211-run loss, with more than a day to spare, in the first Test at Lord&#8217;s on Sunday when they collapsed to 119 all out after being set 331 to win.

But their hopes of levelling the four-match series at 1-1 have been made considerably more difficult by the absence of fast bowler Rabada. The 22-year-old received a one-match ban for his latest offence under the International Cricket Council&#8217;s code of conduct as a result of swearing at Ben Stokes following his dismissal of the England all-rounder in the first innings at Lord&#8217;s. &#8220;It&#8217;s a big loss for everything, the Proteas and Test cricket,&#8221; Elgar said. Rabada has taken 77 wickets in 18 career Tests at an impressive average of under 25 apiece and Elgar said: &#8220;He is a vitally important bowler. &#8220;He&#8217;s been a phenomenal strength to our bowling attack for the last three years in all formats. I think for the game of cricket it is a loss.&#8221; Rabada was in the wickets as South Africa took seven in Sunday&#8217;s morning session to reduce England to 182 for eight in their second innings at lunch on the fourth day. &#8220;Going into lunch with eight down, I really thought we&#8217;d given ourselves the best opportunity,&#8221; said opening batsman Elgar. &#8220;I think that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so disappointing to be sitting here after things capitulated as they did.&#8221; South Africa, however, did not help their own cause by twice dropping Joe Root in the course of a first-innings 190 that also saw him stumped off a no-ball. And on Sunday, they also saw Vernon Philander drop a routine catch at long-off when Jonny Bairstow had made just seven. Bairstow went on to make 51 and share a ninth-wicket stand of 45 with Mark Wood that all but put the match beyond South Africa&#8217;s reach. &#8220;I do think in Test cricket, particularly, you have to make your own luck,&#8221; said Elgar. &#8220;We haven&#8217;t been kind to ourselves the last four days, small things, but they impacted the Test in quite a big way &#8211; dropped catches, non-negotiable no-balls, they would definitely have made life easier as a captain. &#8220;(But) we need to take it on the chin and crack on. &#8220;These are the punches you have to take &#8211; you have to get up tomorrow morning with a smile on your face and know there is a Test in four days, and you have to start again.&#8221; Meanwhile South Africa coach Russell Domingo has returned home for the second time this tour.
