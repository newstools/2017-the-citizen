Zodwa Wabantu did an interview with eNCA about her videos and how people have responded to her infamy. In the interview, Zodwa says at first people criticised her and called her names, but she was unfazed by what they had to say because she does not live for them. She says, however, the number of people who appreciate her has been growing.

I understand. I am moved by her resilience. She reasserts the right to her own body despite society s attempt to make it into a taboo,&#8221; he tweeted. Clearly, Ndlozi is a fan of the entertainer. Leslie Thoka, who also appears to be a fan of Zodwa, responded to Ndlozi s comment: Thank you Mr Ndlozi #HandsOffZodwa. I understand. Am moved by her resilience. She reasserts the right to own her body despite society&#39;s attempt to make it into taboo https://t.co/G9DqteLFaz &mdash; IG: @MbuyiseniNdlozi (@MbuyiseniNdlozi) July 14, 2017 ALSO READ: Zodwa Wabantu charges R25k for a booking
