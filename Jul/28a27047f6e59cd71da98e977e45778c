Gelding seems to have done the trick for Bold Coast and the three year old can notch up another win when he runs in Race 7 at the Vaal tomorrow. Stanley Ferreira s charge has only raced eight times for two wins and three places. After a disappointing effort in a MR 80 Handicap over 1160m at Tuffontein in December the connections obviously felt it was time to pull out the scalpel. The gelding was performed in January and a er a four-month break, Bold Coast returned to racing on the Inside track at Turffontein in a race over 1600m. He put up a decent effort, finishing a 5.15-length third behind Navarro but showed his true ability next time out when beating Vulcan over 1400m at the Vaal. He received a 2.5kg penalty for that victory but that should not stop him from winning again in this MR 69 Handicap over the same course and distance. In addition, high numbers seem the place to be drawn and Bold Coast is nicely positioned at barrier No 9. Keagan de Melo, who rode him to victory last time, is back aboard and Bold Coast looks to be one of the be er bets on the card. Var s Your Daddy, the mount of Craig Zackey, looks the main danger but St John Gray s runner does look to be be er over 1600m. Whatever the fate of Var s Your Daddy, Zackey should be on the mark in Race 4 where he rides two-year-old Gonna y for Tyrone Zackey in a Maiden Plate over 1400m. This son of Crusade has raced three times and based on his last start, also over 1400m at the course, looks the best bet on the card. Would you like to place a bet on the horses?
