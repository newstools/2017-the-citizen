On 30 June 2017 The Citizen published an article headlined &#8220;#SAAEmails: I will be buying a holding company, writes board member in which the introductory paragraph stated that SAA s former legal adviser and current board member Peter Tshisevhe had allegedly seen nothing wrong with another board member buying a holding company with the sole intention of doing business with SAA . This conclusion, among others, was improperly reached by the Citizen: Mr Tshisevhe has shown the Citizen that he was not in fact involved in the manner alluded to by Yakhe Kwinana in leaked emails. Mr Tshisevhe did not receive any instruction from Kwinana (or any other SAA official) and did not act in any manner that could be interpreted as being against the best interests of SAA or his client. Mr Tshisevhe s client did not ultimately participate in the fuel deal reported on in this article. The Citizen regrets any insinuation that Mr Tshisevhe is not an attorney of impeccable character, as well as the factual errors and any damage that it may have caused Mr Tshisevhe. We apologise unreservedly.
