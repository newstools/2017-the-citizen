Hundreds of Grade 8 pupils will get a chance to improve on their crucial subjects after the Gauteng Department of Education launched the Winter School Supplementary Programme in Winterveldt, Pretoria, yesterday. The programme, in partnership with Telkom, took in 924 pupils from the Tshwane West District, who underwent tests to be enrolled. Out of the 160 primary, secondary and high schools in the area, only five were selected. They were Winterveldt High School, MH Baloyi Secondary School, Seageng Secondary School, NM Tsuene and Ruabohlale Junior Secondary School. The programme targeted schools that taught Grades 8 to 12 in the district. Teachers were selected through writing a performance exam to provide extra lessons for mathematics, natural science and English, said project manager and Head of ICT and e-Learning from the GDE district Motladi Matila. The purpose is to assist the learners with those subjects as most learners choose maths literacy instead of maths when they get to Grade 12. We want to establish a culture where pupils will own up to mathematics and do courses that talk to that. That is why we are looking at these subjects from Grade 8. She said the programme would be launched in two phases, with the second starting later this month, where tablets would be given to the pupils. Matila said once schools return from recess, the programme would continue on Saturdays until the end of the year. Department spokesperson Steve Mabona said the programme would be expanded to other grades, with the intention of all schools using technology for learning by 2019.
