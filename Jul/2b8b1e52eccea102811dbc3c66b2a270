Bianzino has only had one run in the last six months but if anywhere close to best form will be hard to beat in Race 3 at Fairview today, a MR 76 Handicap over 1900m on the Polytrack. The five-year-old Dynasty gelding has been racing in far stronger company that he meets in this event and despite a 80-day break and 61kg on his back, Alan Greeff s runner should have the better of this field. He had two runs in January and then was rested until April. He had just one run, in a MR 91 Handicap over this distance, and was just touched off by Rosslyn Chapel. He was reported to have kicked the gate as he came out and that might be why he has not raced since. The Greeff yard is in hot form and Greg Cheyne is in Port Elizabeth to ride Bianzano so one must assume he is fit enough to win a race of this nature. It is hard to believe that just three years ago Rake s Chestnut was seen as a possible Vodacom Durban July winner. He was a desperately unlucky loser of the Grade 1 Daily News in 2014 where he was touched off by Legislate. As a result he went off as one of the Durban July favourites but suffered massive interference and trailed in eight lengths behind Legislate. Sadly he was not the same after that and it was not until March this year that he notched up a second victory when beating En Gee Oh over this course and distance. He went on to run his next two races on the turf but failed to place. This time he returns to the Polytrack, his merit rating has dropped another 10 points (5kg) and he will carry just 53.5kg. Craig Zackey takes the ride for the Tara Laing yard and Rake s Chestnut must have a winning chance. Others to consider are Lucky Luciano and Lotus Elan.
