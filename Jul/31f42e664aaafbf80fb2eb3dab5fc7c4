In a bold move by the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) last week, the only laboratory in Africa licensed to fight the scourge of doping in sport was stripped of its accreditation. The testing centre in Bloemfontein lost its rights to monitor the use of prohibited substances due to non-compliance with international standards. The laboratory was already under suspension, and while the decision made by Wada may have no immediate impact on the domestic testing process, it might have long-term implications. According to the SA Institute for Drug-Free Sport, sending athlete samples overseas has caused minor delays, but the local anti-doping body insisted last year the suspension of the laboratory would not affect the number of tests conducted. Nevertheless, with no Wada-accredited laboratories stationed in Africa, the question must be raised about the continent s desire to fight drug abuse in sport. Though the US and European countries have been criticised for the number of athletes found guilty of gaining an unfair advantage, a system that catches cheats is a system that works. In order to be seen to be taking the global fight against doping seriously, Africa must surely show enough interest and find the resources to ensure they are able to test the continent s own athletes when they compete on home soil.
