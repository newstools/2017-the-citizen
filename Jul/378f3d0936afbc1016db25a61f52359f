A crime-prevention blitz in Lyttelton on Saturday saw the arrests of 40 people, reports the Centurion Rekord. This was during a joint operation by police and the Lyttelton Sector 4 Community Policing Sub Forum (LS4 CPSF). Security companies and other law-enforcement agencies also assisted. The operation was led by Captain Dave Miller from the Lyttelton police, who manned the fixed wing aircraft. The first part of the operation took place adjacent to the R21 highway close to the Bay View Estate, where approximately 35 illegals were arrested. The second part was conducted in the area next to De Villebois and Delmas roads, opposite the unfinished mall. Approximately five people were arrested in the open field. The adjacent areas, Elarduspark and Moreletapark, have experienced an increase in crime over the past three months, said LS4 CPSF s Willie Vorster. Joint and coordinated planning with the SAPS led to this successful operation and although crime is far from being contained, a decrease in crime related statistics can be expected. He paid tribute to the LS4 contingent who sacrificed time and effort to fight crime. He called on residents of the Elarduspark, Wingatepark, Rietvalleipark, Rietvalleirand and Waterkloof AH area to join the LS4 JOC and assist with ongoing efforts to fight crime. All operations are planned and executed within the parameters of the law and the participants safety is a high priority and observed at all times, said Vorster. These actions are designed and planned to be proactive and have proved to be one of the best, sustainable methods to keep our community safe. The weekend operation was the third in a period of six months.
