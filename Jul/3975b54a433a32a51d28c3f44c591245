The SA Communist Party s (SACP) second deputy general secretary Solly Mapaila says he has deposed an affidavit with the Inspector General of Intelligence against President Jacob Zuma over his controversial midnight Cabinet reshuffle earlier this year in March. Speaking on Sunday during a panel discussion on corruption at Lilliesleaf Farm in Rivonia, northern Johannesburg, on Sunday night, Mapaila said Zuma lied to the SACP during a meeting with the party&#8217;s leaders when he told them he axed Pravin Gordhan and Mcebisi Jonas from the finance ministry over a so-called intelligence report that alleged the pair were conspiring and plotting a coup to overthrow the government. I have noticed many lies being told by the president. That&#8217;s why I can say now in public for the first time that I&#8217;ve deposed an affidavit&#8230;.he lied to us. How could he tell us the truth and lie to the public. So I had to take that step which I felt is important that we bring him to the commitment of our movement, he said.
