Zodwa Wabantu attended the Durban July on Saturday and wore a simple black number that has been the talk of the Twitter streets. Zodwa Wabantu is the leading dance lady of Eyadini Lounge, found in uMlazi, KwaZulu-Natal. She is that one person who takes to the dance floor and impresses everyone with her dancing skills, in heels. On Saturday, however, it was not her dance moves that set tongues wagging, but her dress. The dress had a slit that went up to her hips, leaving nothing to the imagination as she walked, showing that wearing underwear was not the order of the day. In one one of the pictures shared on social media, Babes Wabantu can be seen walking with her behind exposed.
