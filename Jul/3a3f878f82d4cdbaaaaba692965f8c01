The depressing thing about the Proteas&#8217; opening day in the first Test against England at Lord&#8217;s is that it confirmed everything that was feared about the team&#8217;s state of mind. One of the biggest themes in the build-up to Thursday&#8217;s action was whether South Africa could salvage a tour that has all gone wrong to date. And, of course, whether they still have the will to fight. Judging by England&#8217;s score of 357/5 at the close, that question looks answered. The Proteas, eventually, had no answer to the brilliant Joe Root. England&#8217;s new captain was irresistible in ending the day unbeaten on 184 off just 226 balls. 26 fours flew off his bat as he enjoyed himself immensely after a difficult start. But Root had help. On five, he attempted a hook off Kagiso Rabada (1/94) but subsitute fielder Aiden Markram came in too much from the fine leg boundary and the ball fell behind him. Had the stayed on the fence, Markram could&#8217;ve taken the catch. Then, on 16, Root didn&#8217;t quite control a flash outside off-stump. The ball went quickly but JP Duminy dropped the chance at point. It was a missed that cost South Africa dearly. To add insult to injury, Morne Morkel (1/64) had Ben Stokes (56) bowled off a no-ball when he had 44. Rabada at least made sure that error wasn&#8217;t too costly but the psychological blow was absolutely huge. Thereafter, the Proteas simply looked like a team that didn&#8217;t care. They let the game drift and the home side eventually boasted a run rate of over four per over as Root and Moeen Ali (61*) will resume a sixth wicket partnership of 167. That is simply unacceptable. Frustratingly, it all started so well for the Proteas. Led by Vernon Philander at his plucky best, they had England 82/4 at lunch. The stocky seamer varied his length and generally bowled straight to finish with excellent figures of 3/46. Yet it was also an indication of the Proteas&#8217; attitude. They seemed to rely on moments of inspiration &#8211; almost as if they didn&#8217;t expect it &#8211; and when things didn&#8217;t fall in their lap, they couldn&#8217;t bother making things happen.
