Fans gathered on Friday at the Greyville Racecourse for what was promoted as the biggest event at this year&#8217;s Vodacom Durban July. Hosted by the infamous Mabala Noise Entertainment, the launch concert included two international acts, French Montana and Robin Thicke, who both endured having to perform to a half-full crowd that hardly sang or knew any of their songs. The pair attempted to keep die-hard fans entertained. However, watching paint dry seemed far more worthwhile than Grammy Award winner Thicke.

Also set to perform was Canadian rapper Tory Lanez (but she was allegedly booked off sick), along with Du Boiz, AKA, Cassper Nyovest, Kwesta, Riky Rick, Emtee, Da L.E.S, Gigi Lamayne, Zakwe, L vovo, Nadia Nakai, Zakes Bantwini and Jay Spitter.
