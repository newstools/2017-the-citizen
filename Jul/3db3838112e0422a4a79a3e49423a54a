Both South African players in the main draw will face the same opponent at the first hurdle over the next few days, as Kevin Anderson and Raven Klaasen start their campaigns at the annual Wimbledon Championships. Anderson, turning out for the first time since withdrawing from his fourth-round match at the French Open with a hamstring injury last month, will meet Spaniard Fernando Verdasco in the first round of the men&#8217;s singles competition on Monday. The lanky SA player, a former world No 10, reached the fourth round at Wimbledon in 2014 and 2015 but has since struggled to find his best form after battling with injuries and illness. Klaasen and American partner Rajeev Ram will enter the Grand Slam tournament among the favourites for the doubles title. The No 7 seeds, who reached the semifinals last year, will square up later in the week against Verdasco, a former top-10 player in the singles and doubles divisions, and Romanian Marius Copil.
