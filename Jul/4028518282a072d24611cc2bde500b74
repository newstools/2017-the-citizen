Is ANC chairperson and Mpumalanga Premier David Mabuza no longer part of the so-called premier league, as media reports suggest? That s the million-dollar question many have been asking in ANC circles surrounding the party s hotly contested leadership race. According to a report by Sowetan, Mabuza reportedly held secretive meetings with ANC provincial leaders from Eastern Cape, Limpopo and Gauteng, who are seen as opposed to former African Union commission chairperson Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma s presidential campaign. The meetings are said to have given the provinces that back Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa s campaign hope that the Mpumalanga strongman might support them at the ANC s upcoming national elective conference later this year in December. The report also said at least three senior ANC leaders close to the developments apparently confirmed Mabuza was no longer part of the premier league. And the ANC Youth League (ANCYL) which wanted him to run as Dlamini-Zuma s deputy confirmed it would remove Mabuza from its slate and replace him with North West Premier Supra Mahumapelo. The premier league is an informal ANC lobby group said to be led by the provincial chairmen and premiers of the Free State, North West and Mpumalanga, who are firmly behind the Zuma faction. They reportedly include the ANCYL, ANC Women s League, and the Umkhonto weSizwe Military Veterans Association. So judging by Mabuza s statements at the ANC s 5th national policy conference at Nasrec, south of Johannesburg, has he switched to the Ramaphosa slate?
