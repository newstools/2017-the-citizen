The University of Witwatersrand (Wits) on Wednesday awarded South Africa s business leader and entrepreneur, Jabu Mabuza, with an honorary doctorate in recognition of his achievements in entrepreneurship and contribution towards the growth of the South African economy. Mabuza is currently the president of Business Unity South Africa (Busa), chairman of Business Leadership South Africa, executive chairman of Sphere Holdings, chairman of Telkom, as well as chairman of the Africa portion of the merged Anheuser-Busch InBev and SAB Miller. BUSA chief executive, Tanya Cohen, said that the award demonstrated the high-calibre of business leaders that South Africa is capable of producing. Mabuza is an accomplished business leader who has contributed immensely towards business leadership and growing the South African economy. It is, therefore, befitting that he is awarded an honorary doctorate from one of South Africa s leading universities, Cohen said. We congratulate Dr Jabu Mabuza. We are very proud of what he has accomplished and we are very honoured and privileged to have someone of his calibre as the President of BUSA. Meanwhile, Wits on Tuesday conferred on honorary Doctor of Music degree on legendary musician, Hugh Masekela, in the Great Hall, the same stage where he performed as a 19-year-old member of the orchestra in the opening concert of Todd Matshikiza s landmark jazz opera King Kong. I am deeply honoured and honesty humbled, Masekela said in his acceptance speech. Masekela implored graduates to become the new pioneers of African heritage restoration at a time when we seem to be leaning on the brink of being wholly swallowed by most Western culture and several Middle Eastern and Eastern civilisations to the exclusion of our own traditions .
