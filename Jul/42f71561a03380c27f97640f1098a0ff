Vuzu TV has released a teaser of Bonang Matheba&#8217;s reality show, Being Bonang, and has already received bad comments. In the teaser, Bonang can be seen holding her phone reading negative comments she has received on social media and shedding tears over them. She goes on to share another &#8216;happy&#8217; post with tears, showing that everything is not always as it seems on social media. She says viewers will see a side of hers they have never seen before, but some of her Instagram followers are not buying it. These were some of the comments on the video: &#8220;Oh please even that tear looks CGI&#8230; I know it&#8217;s not but I fail to believe she&#8217;s bothered by such c&#8217;mon.&#8221; &#8220;Crocodile tears.&#8221; &#8220;Fake tears.&#8221; &#8220;Always playing the victim.&#8221; &#8220;She jolas with a pregnant woman&#8217;a baby daddy, denies it and threatens to sue baby mama for expos before 5pm, Twitter is a buzz.&#8221; &#8220;Although she &#8216;reigns&#8217; supreme, that scandal hangs over her head. So what better way than to give sa a reality show she once said would never happen&#8230;&#8230;then play victim. LOL, wa makatsa tlhe.&#8221; &#8220;I have nothing against her she&#8217;s a very hard working young lady however if you are going to do a reality show it better be believable. Fake tears and scripted drama won&#8217;t cut unless are a really good actor, which she is not.&#8221; &#8220;It&#8217;s scripted, the fake tears and drama just gave it away. I still insist Papa Penny had the best reality show ever, it was simply raw and unscripted. UBonang and her fakeness can take several seats. Besides what happened to &#8216;I&#8217;m never having a reality show?'&#8221; Watch the teaser below: A side of @bonang_m you have never seen before&#8230; #BeingBonang premieres July 14th at 19:30! #VUZUAMP A post shared by Vuzu TV (@vuzutv) on Jul 4, 2017 at 1:46am PDT Some have, however, defended her against the hate she has received on social media, saying people should keep quiet if they have nothing good to say about her. &#8220;So what if she&#8217;s dating someone&#8217;s man ..he loves her too and it&#8217;s her love life so get out of it and fix your sad lives. She didn&#8217;t do this for u haters ,she did for herself and US and her fans whether its fake or not its got nothing to do with you. Perhaps you might even want to learn a thing or two from her,&#8221; said one of her supporters. &#8220;People are so pathetic and really small minded&#8230;This doesn&#8217;t mean #BeingBonang is scripted watch and listen ..when it ends it says.&#8221;see a side you&#8217;ve never seen before&#8221; meaning this is what @bonang_m goes through on a daily because your hate&#8230;You are hateful and stupid,cant even understand a simple video. And Bonang has a right to change her mind she is her own women&#8230;Y&#8217;all are bitter,&#8221; added another. Also read: Bonang Matheba on her R500k birthday party and marriage
