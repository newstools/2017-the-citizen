The Centurion Licensing Centre was shut down on Wednesday after an overnight burglary in which computers and cameras were stolen. Tshwane Metro Police said the theft prompted an immediate shutdown of the licensing centre to allow the South African Police Service to conduct an investigation without hindrances. The centre will remain closed today with some services planned to resume tomorrow, the metro police said in a statement. Preliminary investigations revealed that PCs, eNaTIS screens and camera equipment were stolen. Tshwane metro spokesperson Senior Superintendent Isaac Mahamba said it was anticipated that the Centurion Centre would be operational on Thursday with limited services including learner license testing, practical driver testing and collection of new license cards. There will not be any license renewal service offered until further notice, said Mahamba, adding that these services were available at Akasia and Bronkhorstspruit Licensing Centres.
