An old clip of the late legendary musician Brenda Fassie has resurfaced on social media and left many thinking no one can ever live up to her standard. The clip, taken out of her documentary, I&#8217;m Not a Bad Girl, details her sex life in a way that has shocked social media users even today. &#8220;I don&#8217;t say I&#8217;m the best, but I think I can do it. Some men cry because I sing. I sing when I make love, sing for them. And one guy said to me: &#8216;Oh I wish the world could see that I&#8217;m f*ucking Brenda Fassie&#8217;. And I said: &#8216;Wow man, don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;ll tell the world. And he came 85 times,&#8221; she said.
