Pilou Asb k plays Captain Euron Greyjoy, a ruthless pirate, in the successful television series Game Of Thrones and the equine namesake of the Danish actor looks heading for equal triumph when he runs in Race 7 at Turffontein tomorrow. When Pilou ran third behind Doosra at the Vaal on debut over 1200m in October last year, the buzz going around was that Sean Tarry had a high regard for this son of Western Winter but his charge would need further. As a result it came as no surprise Pilou went o a 5-10 favourite in his next start but ran a one- length third behind Woodland Sage. Eventually a decision was taken to geld him and that seems to have made a positive contribution to his form. He needed his first run after a three-and-a-half-month layoff when a 7.50-length fifth behind Bold Viking in the Non-Black Type Egoli Mile over 1600m on the Turffontein Standside track. He then reverted to a Maiden Plate over 1400m at the same track where he went down a neck to Starpath but in his third run back Pilou finally put it all together in a Maiden Plate over 1600m at the Vaal beating, Spanish Tune by six lengths. His next start was over 1600m on the Turffontein Inside track and once again Pilou was well supported, going o as 5-2 favourite, but suffered interference and could only manage fourth place, beaten just 2.40 lengths by Duzi Moon. He runs in a Novice Handicap over the same course and distance tomorrow and there looks to be very little opposition. The only runner with form anywhere close to Pilou is Hieronymus but Brian Wiid s charge looks to need further. S manga Khumalo rides Pilou and they will jump from barrier No 4, which is ideal on this track. Would you like to place a bet on the horses? Click here to get started in 3 easy steps.
