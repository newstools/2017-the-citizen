Deirdre Larkin breezes through Johannesburg&#8217;s suburbs most mornings, her white hair buffeted by the wind as she runs her well-trodden 8km training course. At 85-years-old, this retired concert pianist who only began running in later life can complete a half marathon in just over two hours and holds the world record time for her age. &#8220;Before I turned 78, the last time I ran was in college, and I was really bad,&#8221; she said, standing in her home in front of a wall of some 500 medals recognising her athletic feats. Stopping for selfies with children and to offer her fellow runners encouragement, Larkin has become a major draw at the races she runs. Larkin always offers encouragement to other runners. &#8220;As people pass me, because most people pass me, they greet me and say &#8216;hello &#8211; I saw you on TV!&#8217; Otherwise we don&#8217;t really talk for any length of time because you need your breath,&#8221; she said following a recent 10-km race in Pretoria. Her late fame as a runner has come as a surprise for the pianist who arrived in South Africa from Britain in 1970. Shortly after 2000, Larkin&#8217;s doctor diagnosed her with osteoporosis which she was unable to treat with medication or injections. Then in 2010, one of her four children briefly moved into her home in Johannesburg&#8217;s middle-class Randburg suburb &#8211; where she has been dubbed by local media the &#8220;Grand Dame of Randburg&#8221;. &#8220;My son ran three times a week. I said I would join him. When I started, I was walking three steps, running three steps, walking three steps&#8230;,&#8221; she recalled. Just seven years later, her running had been transformed. In May she was invited to compete in Switzerland where she completed a half-marathon in two hours five minutes, setting a world record for her age group. &#8220;Running in Geneva was absolute magic, the race itself was lovely. It was flat, you started in the gardens, you came to the fields and you ran alongside the lake,&#8221; she said. To stay in shape, Larkin adheres to a strict regimen &#8211; no sugar, salt or coffee and a 5:00 am start every day for training. Last year alone she ran in 65 races, including several 21 km half-marathons. &#8220;There&#8217;s always an element of disbelief. I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;ve done it. But my body tells me the next day I certainly did it,&#8221; she said. &#8220;My blood goes around my body much quicker, I don&#8217;t feel cold, I can feel all the muscles in my body &#8212; I never knew I&#8217;ve got so many muscles! I feel much more alive.&#8221; Once her gruelling morning routine is complete, Larkin doesn&#8217;t take time to rest. Jumping into her small yellow car she heads to a private college in the north of the city to give piano lessons. Larkin, a former concert pianist, still gives piano lessons. Still stressed in her pink and blue Nike running shoes, but having swapped her shorts for trousers, Larkin put a teenage girl through her paces while wielding a conductor&#8217;s baton. The former concert pianist does not allow a single error to go unmentioned &#8212; but still congratulates the pupil on her progress. &#8220;After lessons I&#8217;m usually very exhausted&#8230; (but) it reminds me that I can do whatever I want to do because she&#8217;s defying all odds,&#8221; said the 17-year-old student Vuyo Tshwele as she paused between scales. Every week some 30 students gather to learn from Larkin&#8217;s experience, formed over many years of playing in Vienna and Britain, as well as South Africa. And despite preparing to turn 86 in September, Larkin has no intention of slowing down. &#8220;I can imagine a life without running but it&#8217;s a kind of slow death,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to run as long as I can &#8211; even if I only have one leg, I&#8217;ll manage.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
