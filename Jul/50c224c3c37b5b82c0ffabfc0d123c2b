After a miserable time in England over the past six weeks, the South African cricket team finally have a chance for redemption. In nine internationals on tour six one-day internationals and three T20s the Proteas have managed only three wins. They lost both the T20 and limited overs series against England, while they were dumped out of the Champions Trophy in the first round after their solo triumph over Sri Lanka. But today s opening Test in the four-match series at Lord s presents the Proteas many of whom weren t involved in the shorter formats of the game the chance to salvage the tour. They will enter the Test with a new skipper in Dean Elgar, standing in for regular Faf du Plessis, back at home after the birth of his first child. The five-day game is also the format where they have enjoyed a wonderful run over the past 11 months after managing home and away Test series victories over New Zealand, an away win over Australia and a whitewash over Sri Lanka on home soil. They also have enjoyed a superb record over England in England in recent times, having not lost a Test series to England away from home since 1998. Let s hope history repeats itself on this tour.
