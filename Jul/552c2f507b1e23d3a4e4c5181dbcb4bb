While most were concerned about what the queen of all things fashion and style Bonang Matheba and Qauntico actress Pearl Thusi would show up in, there were a host of other deserving style icons at the Durban July on Saturday. This year&#8217;s event will always be remembered as the July in which the &#8220;underdogs&#8221; came out of the shadows and posed for a picture or two. Even the infamous Skolopad chose to represent her Free State roots and show up in an African grass straw broom-inspired dress. Not Just a Re-Birth I&#39;ve also have a story to tell.Thank u Durban July 2017 pic.twitter.com/3Z5KKLcMlb &mdash; #TLOBONENG (@queenskolopad) July 1, 2017 What I loved most about this dress is how it showed off her beautiful body in a way that transcended most of her previously far more revealing dresses. Drivetime show host Phat Joe also chose to show off his beautiful fianc e Palesa Mogan as the couple made their first public appearance since the announcement of their engagement.
