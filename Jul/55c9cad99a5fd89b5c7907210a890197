The ANC robbed us of Police Minister Fikile Mbalula and Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba&#8217;s Durban July outfits when it held its policy conference on the same weekend as the Durban July. According to a Twitter user, the ruling party chose the Durban July weekend to test the two ministers&#8217; loyalty to the movement. . Mbalula saw the tweet and told the user that not attending the Durban July was not at all a problem as the ANC was right at the top of his priority list. One would think he would be commended for putting his job first, but most of his followers criticised him for his &#8220;ANC first&#8221; statement. &#8220;Yep, ANC first, and stuff the country, stuff the people and stuff the future. Sies!&#8221; said one user. Others said the minister just did not have a choice. &#8220;His mind was at the Durban July the entire time,&#8221; they claimed. Either way, the ministers clearly passed he test by choosing the conference over the glamorous event in Durban, where they have been a feature for as far back as we can remember. The annual event saw celebs and politicians such as EFF leaders Mbuyiseni Ndlozi and Julius Malema who took his wife along party with Tbo Touch, though the fun ended with Ndlozi being comically accused of snatching Touch&#8217;s wife. The online radio boss shared a picture on social media of the people&#8217;s bae having a good laugh with his wife, Nandi Molefe, and jokingly accused him of stealing her. My wife is gone, look @MbuyiseniNdlozi smile #TouchHD Marquee experience, wrote Tbo Touch. Read more: Did Ndlozi just snatch Tbo Touch&#8217;s wife? &nbsp;
