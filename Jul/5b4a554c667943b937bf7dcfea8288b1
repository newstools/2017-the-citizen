A recording sent by an anonymous source to You magazine has emerged in the midst of a legal battle between Vittone who is fighting to inherit her deceased husband&#8217;s estate. Vittone has said that she wants to ensure her children are well taken care of and benefit from the will. However, there are two versions of the will, with one signed by Van der Westhuizen in which he leaves everything to Vittone and their two children while another will, which is signed only by his attorney does not leave her anything at all. In the recording, a woman who is allegedly Vittone, hurls a barrage of insults at the person on the other end, who it is understood is allegedly Van der Westhuizen. While the receiver of the phone-call doesn&#8217;t respond, he makes what appears to be gurgling sounds, You magazine reports that the call was made just before Van der Westhuizen&#8217;s death in February. &#8220;You&#8217;re in a wheelchair little boy. You can&#8217;t do anything for yourself. I don&#8217;t need you in my life. You&#8217;re such a lowlife asshole. &#8220;I have a great relationship with a great man,&#8221; Vittone allegedly said. She has reportedly said the recording was manipulated and the person who leaked it wanted to destroy her reputation and career. &#8220;The person or people behind it want to destroy my career, my reputation and my kids. They want to inflict optimal damage,&#8221; she said. Listen to the recording below READ MORE: &#8216;Broke&#8217; Joost leaves family &#8216;a shotgun and too little cash&#8217;
