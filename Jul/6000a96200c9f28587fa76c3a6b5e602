The epicentre of Friday s fire at Eastern Cape premier Phumulo Masualle s offices in Bhisho was in a storage area for supply chain management documents, some of which were part of an inquiry into possible irregularities in procurement by government, it emerged on Sunday. Personnel working at the office of the premier which also housed director general Marion Mbina-Mthembu and members of her executive discovered a fire at about 2.30pm and quickly alerted other colleagues, Eastern Cape government spokesman Sonwabo Mbananga said on Sunday. The entire building was evacuated quickly and safely soon thereafter. There were no injuries. Firefighters, the South African Police Service (SAPS), as well as emergency services were quick to arrive at the scene and government commended their prompt reaction and assistance, he said. Upon learning of where the epicentre of the fire was, government was also quick to indicate that this was where supply chain management documents were being stored while undergoing digital scanning for archiving. These documents are also part of an inquiry by the director general into possible irregularities in procurement by government dating back to 2010. An assessment as to the impact the fire is likely to have on the inquiry is being undertaken and will become clearer in the coming days, Mbananga said. An impact assessment on, in particular government programs and service delivery systems, was also underway. Masualle assured the citizens of the Eastern Cape and South Africa at large that the provincial government remained fully functional. On Monday, Masualle would conduct his first site-visit of the fire-damaged offices and hold a media briefing afterwards, Mbananga said.
