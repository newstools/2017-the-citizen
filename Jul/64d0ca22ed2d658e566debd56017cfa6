It is highly unlikely the Lions will rush Warren Whiteley back into action if they reach the Super Rugby final. Speculation has been mounting over a possible earlier return from a pelvic injury for the Springboks captain, especially after previous comments from the Lions medical staff saying he recovers quicker than most due to his attitude to rehab. Also read: LOOK! This is how the Lions photobombed us! Yet even if Johan Ackermann&#8217;s troops triumph over the Hurricanes at Ellis Park in Saturday&#8217;s semifinal, Whiteley doesn&#8217;t currently figure in their plans. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have to assess a situation like that next week. We really haven&#8217;t been focusing on Warren,&#8221; said the Lions mentor on Thursday. &#8220;He&#8217;s really pushing his own rehabilitation. Him and I haven&#8217;t really spoken about any possible involvement. Also, I really don&#8217;t want to place him under extra pressure in that regard. We&#8217;ve assembled 23 players to do the job and we need to make sure those men are as well prepared as possible.&#8221; In fact, the Springboks are far more emphatic about the matter. Following a medical assessment camp in Stellenbosch this week, the national team confirmed Whiteley &#8220;will not be allowed&#8221; to take part in any Super Rugby action. &#8220;Warren s injury requires time to heal and he will hopefully recover in time for the Rugby Championship. But at this stage we are taking it week for week in conjunction with the medical team of the Lions,&#8221; Springboks team doctor Konrad von Hagen said in a statement. But that doesn&#8217;t mean Whiteley isn&#8217;t pulling his weight. The 29-year-old eighthman has been functioning as an extra member of the coaching team. &#8220;He&#8217;s been actively involved with the team off the field,&#8221; said Ackermann. &#8220;He&#8217;s constantly encouraging his teammates and he&#8217;s talked a lot in our team meetings.&#8221; During last weekend&#8217;s narrow 23-21 win over the Sharks, Whiteley was seen making a conscious effort to go and talk to the replacements close to half-time. It attested to his passion. For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter. Would you like to place a rugby bet? Click here to get started in 3 easy steps.
