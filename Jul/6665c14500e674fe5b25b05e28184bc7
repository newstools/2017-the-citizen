The Canford Cliffs filly Clifton Sunset has built up a string of three in a row runner-up berths and two of those were with jockey Anton Marcus in the irons. She deserves better and should win Race 7, a FM 82 Handicap over 1200m at Scottsville today. This three-year-old will probably enjoy going back to the turf after her last two starts on the Greyville Polytrack and she returns to the distance of her only win. Trainer Brett Crawford has his string at the top of their game, but if there are any dangers they could be La Revere and Plume Del Toro &#8211; both from the Dennis Drier yard &#8211; and Rainbowinthesky from the Duncan Howells stable. These three runners though are all returning from a break so may not be as match fit as Clifton Sunset will surely be. The first two races on this card are filled with first timers so we will move on to Race 3 and it is again a Western Cape raider in the form of Rock My Soul who could be a banker bet. This Twice Over gelding has held his form well recently and deserves to get out of the maiden ranks. Rock My Soul is course and distance suited, jumps from a good draw and has Marcus up for the first time. There should be no excuses for another defeat. Most of his rivals look only modest but one who can improve and is worth a Swinger bet is Golden Pheasant. The Duncan Howells trained Sitia has improved with each run and did well to win on the Polytrack in May so could be of some value in Race 5, a FM 65 Handicap over 1600m. Returning to the turf will not be a problem for this Captain Al filly and her rider Keagan de Melo can be relied on to give her every chance of winning. Jockey Alec Forbes has not had much luck recently does have a winning chance on Captain At Sea in Race 6. This Captain Al three-year-old won over the course and distance in March.
