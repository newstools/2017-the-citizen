DJ Black Coffee has revealed to CNN that he has begun therapy to rehabilitate his left arm. The internationally acclaimed DJ was involved in an accident that left him paralysed 27 years ago. People ask me what are you working on?&#8217; Silently, I know this is what I am working on now,&#8221; he said, patting his arm. I am training it and trying to bring back life into it, he told CNN. Growing up, kids would often tease him about his arm; that motivated him to be the best musician he could be. I don t think I would be here if it (the accident) didn t happen because I started knowing that I didn t really have as many options as other people. What is my talent? Let me research and work on it and be the best at it,&#8221; he said. ALSO READ: Black Coffee is the new owner of Zone 6 venue &nbsp;
