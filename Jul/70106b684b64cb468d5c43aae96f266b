The ANC has proposed that the SA Reserve Bank (Sarb) should be wholly state-owned, according to three people close to the situation, Bloomberg and Moneyweb reports. The proposal was reportedly approved in a plenary session at the party s policy conference in Johannesburg on Wednesday. Bloomberg said &#8220;the people who asked not to be identified because it hasn t been made public&#8221; Policy conference decisions will need to be ratified at the party s national electoral conference in December. The rand reportedly fell sharply to around R13.35 to the dollar after the news broke. Image: Moneyweb The bank has private shareholders with no say over policy or the appointment of the governor. Bloomberg reports: &#8220;The Reserve Bank is owned by more than 600 private shareholders who can t hold more than 10 000 shares each, according to its website. The dividend payable to shareholders is limited to 10 cents per share per year, of a total of R200 000 rand ($14,950) a year, if the central bank makes a profit. The bank s after-tax profit for the year through March was 1.4 billion rand.&#8221; This proposal was not contained in any of the policy documents discussed at its policy conference, and came as a big surprise to the market. This follows recommendations by the Public Protecor Busisiwe Mkhwebane s that the constitution must be amended to allow for a change in the bank&#8217;s mandate. She proposed that the Sarb s mandate should be to promote economic growth rather than its virtually exclusive focus to keep inflation between 3% and 6%. Brought to you by Moneyweb
