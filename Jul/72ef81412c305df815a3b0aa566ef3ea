Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba is expected to brief the media this morning at the Johannesburg Stock Exchange in Sandton to outline government&#8217;s inclusive economic growth action plan. This comes as the country is currently in a technical recession after growth contracted 0.7% in the first quarter of this year and two leading global credit ratings agencies downgraded SA to junk status following President Jacob Zuma s controversial Cabinet reshuffle on March 30. To add to the country s economic troubles, last month the unemployment rate spiked to a 13-year high of 27.7%. The briefing is scheduled to begin at 11.30am.
