Well strap on your life jacket, because the pair are auctioning off a private dinner in their exclusive company for charity, a spokesman for the actor told AFP on Tuesday. The glamorous date &#8212; planned for a restaurant of the winner&#8217;s choice in New York City in the fall &#8212; is among several lots being offered at the star-studded Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation gala in the French resort of Saint-Tropez on Thursday. The environmentally-minded charity raised $45 million during its auction last year, according to the Los Angeles Times. Oscar winners DiCaprio, 42, and Winslet, 41, played star-crossed lovers Jack and Rose in James Cameron&#8217;s 1998 retelling of the sinking of the Titanic, and were reunited in 2009 as a warring couple in &#8220;Revolutionary Road.&#8221; While saving the planet has been DiCaprio&#8217;s preoccupation for years, Winslet is involved with charities helping autistic children, as well as organizations for the homeless and disadvantaged people with cancer. The lot is the latest example of a burgeoning celebrity trend of offering dinner dates or other face-to-face meetings to raise cash for charity. British actor Idris Elba agreed to share Valentine&#8217;s Day this year with the highest bidder in aid of the &#8220;W.E. Can Lead&#8221; initiative, which provides education for African youngsters. &#8220;It is one of the easiest ways for celebrities to contribute,&#8221; a public relations specialist told AFP on condition of anonymity, adding that it generates huge amounts of cash.
