2017 has been a year where teenagers have been give huge responsibilities by their Super Rugby franchises. You don&#8217;t need to look further than the Sharks&#8217; Curwin Bosch or the Kings&#8217; Yaw Penxe. Damian Willemse isn&#8217;t one of them though. Also read: Bulls storm their way into our Super Rugby XV of the week In fact, the Stormers&#8217; starting flyhalf against the Cheetahs last weekend was given an &#8220;easier&#8221; ride. &#8220;Easier&#8221;, however, is a relative term because the only thing the 19-year-old prodigy wasn&#8217;t expected to do was take over the goal-kicking duties. &#8220;With Damian making his first start, Vlokkie (Cilliers, the Stormers&#8217; kicking coach) thought we shouldn&#8217;t let him kick for poles,&#8221; said Stormers assistant coach Paul Feeney. &#8220;We didn&#8217;t want to put all the pressure on him at this age immediately.&#8221; The funny thing about that is that Willemse&#8217;s general play and his handling of pressure was so excellent that team management might actually be convinced to give him a bigger role. &#8220;The situation might possibly not be the same,&#8221; said Feeney. &#8220;This weekend&#8217;s game against the Sunwolves might be a good time to groom Damian. He&#8217;s familiar with Newlands and knows the conditions. He might slot a few kicks.&#8221; Goal-kicking shouldn&#8217;t represent the be-all and end-all of Willemse as a player, merely a cherry on top. He is a far more rounded player than that &#8211; as his showing in Bloemfontein showed. &#8220;It s great he that he scored a try, it was a good little gap he spotted and he stayed in support on the inside,&#8221; said Feeney. &#8220;I think he kicked very well for the sideline &#8211; three or four times off penalties his kicking for the sideline carved off at least 40 metres, some of them with not great angles. Our last try from the line-out when we were down 33-34, he put that ball within 10 metres of the tryline from halfway.&#8221; But the New Zealander, who specialises in skills and defence, isn&#8217;t blind to the fact that it wasn&#8217;t a perfect showing. &#8220;He made a few mistakes and I expected him to make a few mistakes. It is more so the learnings with Damian now. &#8220;He has been given the opportunity and he would have been very nervous last Saturday. I am expecting him to play better again this week. Every minute he gets at this level the better he is going to get over the next while.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter. Would you like to place a rugby bet?
