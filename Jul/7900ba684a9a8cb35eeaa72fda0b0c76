The Zulu ceremony saw Jones&#8217; family handing gifts to Minnie s family to thank them for their daughter while he got to be welcomed in the family as their son-in-law. Basetsana Kumalo was one of the guests, proving to have been a busy day for her as she also attended Bonang Matheba&#8217;s birthday celebration. Also in attendance were Zakes Bantwini, Unathi Msengana and Anele Mdoda, to name a few. In a recent interview with DJ Fresh and Somizi on Metro FM, Minnie said she used to tell her fianc before their engagement that they should not get married but stay together and call each other life partners . The idea of getting married was too sensantionalised for her and she was just over it . I was over the fairy tale, I just wanted to be loved and love. But I knew that if I was ever going to get married, it would be with him, she said. However, all that changed when she got engaged to her boyfriend last year in December.
