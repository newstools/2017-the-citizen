A heavyweight fightcard for a heavyweight venue. The Sun City Superbowl welcomes the Extreme Fighting Championship this weekend with the organisation s two biggest titles on the line. Three-time heavyweight champion Andrew van Zyl will put his gold on the line at EFC 61 when he faces the undefeated Wessel Mostert in the main event on Saturday night. We are really looking forward to this, said EFC president Cairo Howarth. Mostert is a legitimate contender, he s never been stopped and he has a huge chance of beating the champ. Mostert has blown past all the challengers put in front of him, but will face a very different prospect in the man with the iron jaw known as One Gear . Time on the mat is very important and I have more than him, said Van Zyl, a jiu jitsu specialist. I don t think he has the skillset to beat me if it goes to the ground. He has more of a wrestling base and won t have the precision submissions to beat me. Saturday will see Van Zyl competing for the seventh time with the EFC heavyweight title up for grabs. Light-heavyweight champion Champion Dalcha is looking to successfully defend his title against new EFC signing Alan Baudot of France in a the evening s co-main event. For some time the champion was left with no one willing to face him, but the absence of a true contender only existed until the organisation s latest signing raised his hand. Stepping up to the challenge is Baudot, who holds a perfect, undefeated international fight record of six wins, all by way of KO. In addition to the double-title bill, another massive heavyweight clash will ensue as the Bulawayo Bomber, Elvis Moyo, takes on the highly experienced Stuart Austin from England.
