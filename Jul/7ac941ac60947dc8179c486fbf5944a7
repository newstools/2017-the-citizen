The Proteas will return from England next week with nothing to show from their three-month journey. England on Monday wrapped up a comprehensive victory by 239 runs in the third Test at The Oval, meaning the best Faf du Plessis and his men can hope for is to draw the Test series. The fourth and final match commences on Friday in Manchester. Even then, a win will hardly lift the spirits as the Proteas also lost the one-day and T20 series while also being eliminated early from the ICC Champions Trophy. Resuming on a fairly hopeless 117/4 &#8211; chasing an academic 492 &#8211; no one really expected the visitors to save a match that was pretty much never in their grasp. The only highlight was the magnificent defiance of Dean Elgar. The determined left-hander batted superbly in making 136 &#8211; a skillful 228-ball effort that included 20 fours. Temba Bavuma (32) initially helped him resist the English attack before he was trapped LBW by Toby Roland-Jones, who finished with figures of 3/72 and an impressive eight in his first Test for his country. When the ill Vernon Philander padded up to a delivery that nipped back &#8211; much like Du Plessis &#8211; the Proteas&#8217; resistance was all but over. However, Chris Morris (24) showed some guts to survive right up to the last ball of lunch, when he edged Moeen Ali to slip. After some fun from Keshav Maharaj (24*) after the interval, the Proteas&#8217; depressing match was brought to a shuddering halt by Ali. Within three balls, he accounted for Elgar, Kagiso Rabada and Morne Morkel. It was the 14th hat-trick in Test cricket for England and rather summed up South Africa&#8217;s fortunes. They have much to ponder. For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter
