Celebrities and politicians, most of them EFF leaders due to the ANC being caught up in its policy conference, rocked up at the Durban July on Saturday, and, by the looks of it, they had fun. Tbo Touch as usual had his convoy of some of the most expensive rides on the market, and his online radio station, Touch HD, had its own marquee at the event where celebs joined his party. EFF leaders Julius Malema and Mbuyiseni Ndlozi, along with Tbo Touch&#8217;s wife, Nandi Molefe, were there. However, it seems some of these people had a little more fun than expected at least that&#8217;s the impression we got from Tbo Touch&#8217;s tweet on Sunday. The businessman posted a picture of his wife having a laugh with the people&#8217;s bae and jokingly implied that Ndlozi had taken his wife. &#8220;My wife is gone, look @MbuyiseniNdlozi smile #TouchHD Marquee experience,&#8221; wrote Tbo Touch. My wife is gone, look @MbuyiseniNdlozi smile .#TouchHD Marquee experience pic.twitter.com/K9yYc89i8j &mdash; Tbo Touch (@iamtbotouch) July 2, 2017 The picture has been circulating on social media, with Malema having retweeted it. Those who saw it said Touch was the one in the wrong for leaving Ndlozi with his wife. &#8220;They don&#8217;t call him &#8216;people&#8217;s bae&#8217; for nothing,&#8221; they argued. Some, however, defended Ndlozi, saying that, as charming as he was, he was &#8220;harmless&#8221;. These were some of the reactions on Twitter: She is beautiful so what must I do guys pic.twitter.com/kYAV2vc5lX &mdash; Free King Dalindyebo (@HLoleka) July 2, 2017 &#39;________&#39; without compensation &mdash; Mike (@MdlaloseMike) July 2, 2017 The People&#39;s Bae Touch you funny man!
