Paramedics from ER24 arrived on the scene at about 2pm on Saturday where they found the car several metres down an embankment next to the road, ER24 spokesman Werner Vermaak said. The wreckage was found by a group of quad bike riders. Upon investigation, they found the two people inside the car and alerted emergency services. Paramedics assessed the man and woman and found that they have been dead for some time . They were later declared dead on the scene. It is understood from another emergency services company that they responded to reports of a crash near the same area at 2am this morning [Saturday], but were unable to find any signs of a crash.
