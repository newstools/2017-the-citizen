Fewer than one in 10 horses have won over the Greyville Turf 1600m and that is only one of the reasons the R750,000 Thekwini Stakes for two-year-old fillies on Sunday is a trappy affair. Another reason is, besides Miziarawhoisthethirdreserve, only one other runner has even tried the mile before &#8211; Flichity By Farr, who relished the distance last time out but who will be taking a big step up in class. Most of these horses are still immature and there are no guarantees any of them will stay. Little wonder corporate book- maker Be ing World opened their book offering 7-2 and be er the field great odds for anybody who reads the race correctly. Their current favourite is Sean Tarry-trained Desert Rhythm, who is by far the most accomplished runner. She has won three races, including the Golden Slipper over 1400m last time out when she put in a sustained run and beat Let If Flow by a length. Stablemate Rockin Russian was fourth with Mara eighth. Desert Rhythm is bred for this kind of distance and is well drawn. There is collateral form to suggest Lady In Black would be a big player if she had drawn be er. She has won both her starts to date, the last in good fashion over 1400m on the Polytrack. This Dennis Drier-trained filly has a touch of class and could make her presence felt. Paul Peter is throwing un- beaten three-time winner Folk Dance in at the deep end, but has given her a life jacket in the form of jockey Anton Marcus. Nobody would be too surprised if she were to feature prominently, de- spite the widest draw of all. Meryl is another who looks classy enough to overcome a bad barrier, while Rockin Russian was not that well drawn in the Slipper and did well to finish fourth. She is be er drawn, but is by a sprinting stallion and this might extend her to the limit of her stamina. Would you like to place a bet on the horses? Click here to get started in 3 easy steps.
