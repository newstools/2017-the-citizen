It was a special day for Candice Bass-Robinson, who won her first Durban July at Greyville on Saturday with Marinaresco. Expertly marshalled by jockey Bernard Faydherbe, it was a proud moment for the Bass Racing Stable. It&#8217;s probably hardly surprising that they made a mockery of the betting this year, given their proud history and the fact that they groomed the legendary Pocket Power. After Krambambul set the pace initially, Marinaresco skilfully took a subtle gap on the right hand side to set up the victory charge. Al Sahem threatened a strong finish but Faydherbe and his brilliant companion managed to hold them off.
