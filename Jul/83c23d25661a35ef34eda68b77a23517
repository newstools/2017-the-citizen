If the Lions wanted a glimpse &#8211; which is unlikely &#8211; of how without Johan Ackermann will feel, they&#8217;ll get it this week. Despite having the luxury of a bye in Super Rugby, their outgoing head coach won&#8217;t be taking a break. Also read: It s official. Johan Ackermann lost to the Lions and SA (for now) Instead, Ackermann will be in England to introduce himself to Gloucester&#8217;s players and conduct a few introductory training sessions. The 47-year-old earlier this year confirmed that he would be leaving the Lions at the end of the current campaign. Ackermann pretty much needs this week to familiarise himself with his new surroundings as there&#8217;ll be only four weeks left for him to prepare his new side for the new English season &#8211; assuming the Lions reach the Super Rugby final in August. He s going to take some training sessions and he s going to really get involved, said Gloucester chief executive Stephen Vaughan. Meanwhile, veteran hooker Richard Hibbard, who has 38 caps for Wales, expressed his excitement. I ve heard he s an imposing man so I m looking forward to meeting him. He s supposed to be a big bloke, Hibbard told Gloucestershire Live. I ve heard good things about him and I was lucky enough to be with a couple of South Africans on that Baa-baas trip so I spoke to them on the trip and I haven t spoken to anyone who s had a bad word to say about him. I m really excited about what he brings, a new culture and camaraderie and I m excited to meet him. For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
