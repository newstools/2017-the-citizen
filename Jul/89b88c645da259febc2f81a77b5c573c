The factionalism that has beset the ANC in recent times has perhaps never been as pronounced as it is now, with the group of 101 ANC stalwarts announcing on the eve of the party s policy conference that it would boycott the first two days of the five-day event. The conference got under way yesterday in Johannesburg, with expectations that both pro- and anti-Zuma factions would use the conference as a platform to position themselves ahead of the ANC elective conference in December. As a result, observers have warned that the current policy conference could see disruptions, as the party is not only clearly divided, but also has a history of failing to maintain discipline. Ironically, it was the stalwarts attempt to address the challenges facing the ANC that has led to the group s absence from the conference. The party s veterans initially asked for a national consultative conference to be held in the days leading up to the policy conference to tackle the issues facing the ANC. This seemed like a reasonable request, considering the magnitude of problems facing the ruling party. However, the request was denied and many feel that this was a blatant snub from the Zuma faction. While this type of behaviour may not be exactly shocking anymore we have gotten used to President Jacob Zuma disregarding everyone and anyone, as he sees fit it is perhaps more important to look at what the veterans snub of the conference means in context. According to analysts, their decision to boycott the opening of the conference and only to attend it as branch members on the third day, means that the stalwarts are essentially absolving themselves of the scandals of the ANC. It basically means that the vets are publicly washing their hands of the mess that is the ANC and saying they will not support the party as long as Zuma is at the helm.
