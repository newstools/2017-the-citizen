The SA National Civic Organisation (Sanco) has condemned the ruthless killing of an African National Congress ward councillor in Richmond in KwaZulu-Natal and called on law enforcement agencies not to leave any stone unturned until those responsible for the spate of killings in the area are behind bars. Sfiso Mkhize was shot dead in the violence-ravaged region on Thursday night, which brings to three the number of political figures killed in the past few months. Deputy mayor Thandazile Phoswa was killed in April and municipal manager S bu Sithole was shot dead a month before. The ruthless political killings, senseless violence, and heinous crimes committed against elected public representatives undermine the notion of representative governance critical for delivery of services to our communities, Sanco national spokesman Jabu Mahlangu said on Saturday. He conveyed Sanco s condolences to the Mkhize family and the ANC. Mahlangu urged the community to assist the police investigation into the killing, which he described as an act of cowardice aimed at undermining democratic governance . We call on our communities to protect their councillors against opportunistic political thuggery and the senseless violence. He questioned the effectiveness of the multidisciplinary task team appointed to tackle what looked like well-planned political assassinations. It needs to speedily get to the bottom of the spate of killings and establish whether there is a third force rekindling political rivalry in order to destabilise and throw the area into violent conflict, Mahlangu said.
