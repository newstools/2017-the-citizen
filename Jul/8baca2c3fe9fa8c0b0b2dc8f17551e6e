While speaking on the violence that has erupted between Uber and meter taxi drivers, Police Minister Fikile Mbalula took abit of a left turn to take a swipe at local celebrities who don&#8217;t have to use a regular taxi anymore. &#8220;Uber is too sophisticated and it has taken a portion of the market away from taxi drivers.
