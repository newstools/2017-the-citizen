Investigations into a fire at Gauteng Premier David Makhura s building are still continuing, according to the Johannesburg Emergency Services. So far, we don t have any information on the investigation as yet, it is still continuing, emergency services Robert Mulaudzi said. This is after what appeared to be an eerie coincidence as both Makhura s and Eastern Cape Premier Phumulo Masualle s offices caught fire on Friday. Forensic investigators from the South African Police Service were working to establish the possible cause of the fire, which broke out in the office building used by Makhura in Simmonds Street, Johannesburg. The blaze, which started on the seventh floor, was quickly contained and no one was injured. Later that afternoon, one of the buildings at the offices of Masualle, in Bisho, Eastern Cape, was on fire. Emergency services were immediately dispatched to the scene and all staff members were evacuated. Masualle himself was in Gauteng attending the ANC policy conference. Eastern Cape government spokesperson Sonwabo Mbananga said foul play was not ruled out and it was further discovered that the building that caught fire was in the administrative block. It apparently contained seven years worth of documents involved in investigations into tenders at the province.
