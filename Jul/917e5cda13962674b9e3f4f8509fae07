Most casual golfers have a hard time already avoiding water hazards and bunkers. Christer Sjogren, a Swede, had to handle a hazard of a different kind while playing a round in Karlstad. In a hilarious video captured by his friend Tony Swahn, Sjorgen is seen trying to evade a very friendly moose. The calf is clearly only in a playful mood as he actually stops when he sees he might collide with Sjorgen. Before that, Sjorgen was running around in circles and eventually tried to hide behind a tree. Who said golfers don&#8217;t get a physical workout on the course?
