A video of Patrick Mulaudzi, popularly known by his fans as BMW, refusing a lift from a motorist has recently emerged. In the video, BMW can be seen walking fast when a motorist slows down to offer him a lift. In Xitsonga, BMW tells the motorist he is walking to Vuwani, from Mavambe, which is a 31km distance. He says he is going to Vuwani to fetch his friend. When offered a lift, he says he&#8217;s not tired. &#8220;I don&#8217;t feel a thing,&#8221; he insists, as he keeps walking. When asked where his wife is, he says she is in Bulwini (another village in Limpopo) and says he will fetch her the following day. The motorist insists that he gets into the car but BMW is not having any of it as he says he doesn&#8217;t feel &#8220;fokol&#8221;. He further tells the motorist he will accept such a lift only when it&#8217;s raining. In fact, he won&#8217;t even use an umbrella as the wind always blows it away. They offer to buy him bread at a Spar in Vuwani, but then drive off. BMW made headlines in May after stealing the spotlight from President Jacob Zuma during the president&#8217;s visit to Vuwani. He earned the nickname because of his ability to walk far and fast. Residents said at the time that BMW walks as far as 32km to Thohoyandou without resting. Mulaudzi said he started walking fast to exercise, but now does it for fun. He does look like he&#8217;s having fun.
