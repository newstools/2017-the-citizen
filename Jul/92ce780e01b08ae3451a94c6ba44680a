We&#8217;re clearly not too far from having the Mercedes-Benz bakkie on our shores, thanks to a teaser video that has provided us with a glimpse of the X-Class double-cab bakkie ahead of its official reveal. . The X-Class seems to feature LED daytime running lights that are positioned above the headlamps. It is equipped with both roof racks and a styling bar. The front grille is made up of two chunky bars positioned over a mesh insert, while it features slim vertical LED taillamps.

For now, feast your eyes on the teaser video here:
