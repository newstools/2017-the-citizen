Mazda has announced a formal global recall covering a wider manufacturing period for safety reasons. This recall follows investigative recalls by Mazda in Japan and North America for three different types of Takata Corporation manufactured inflators, and although no cases of abnormal deployment or dangerous flaws have been found in any Mazda vehicles in the course of the investigative recall, the extended formal recall campaign was deemed necessary. To date, it has been recorded that an additional estimated 19 000 units are affected in South Africa. Affected units are Mazda2, Mazda6 and RX-8 vehicles produced from 2003 with VIN numbers starting with MM6DE, JM6GG and JMZSE. These include Mazda2, Mazda6 and Mazda RX-8 vehicles equipped with the PSDI-4 driver-side air bag inflator, the SDI-160 driver side airbag inflator, or the SPI , SDI-230 and the PSPI passenger-side airbag inflators. The recall is due to an inappropriate production condition and storage of the propellant in the inflator. The density of the propellant may be insufficient in the inflator. This might cause the propellant to ignite abnormally at the time of airbag deployment and potentially result in extremely high inner pressure of the inflator causing a rupture of the inflator case. In a case of a rupture, the airbag might not deploy as designed and may lead to injury. Mazda Southern Africa is conducting a repair procedure to replace the driver-side airbag and/or passenger-side airbag inflator with an improved unit on the possibly affected vehicles. Although the number of affected vehicles will be subject to further review and may change, Mazda SA urges all owners with possibly affected Mazda2, Mazda6 and Mazda RX-8 vehicles to contact the Mazda SA Dealer Network or the Mazda SA Customer Care Centre on 0860 069 700 or email customercare@mazda.co.za
