The 2017 Fifa Confederations Cup draws to a close this weekend in Russia, with Chile taking on Germany in what promises to be a superb final. What has been less than superb, however, is the use of video-assisted referee (VAR) technology in the competition. Fifa have been trying out the VAR system in the past couple of weeks, with a view to taking it to the World Cup in Russia next year a final decision on this is only expected in March. But there have been several controversial moments at the Confederations Cup that have to bring into question whether the system is ready for such a major tournament. The worst of the lot had to be Cameroon s 3-1 defeat to Germany last Sunday, when Colombian referee Wilmar Roldan used the technology and still sent off the wrong player, Sebastien Siani. Eventually, after using the technology again, Roldan sent off the right player, Ernest Mabouka, but this was not the first time the VAR system had caused confusion and chaos on the field of play in Russia. Video technology has been used to great effect in tennis, cricket and rugby, to name but three sports. But with soccer, on the back of this tournament, the jury still has to be out.
