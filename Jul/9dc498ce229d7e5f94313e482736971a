South Africa s two longest serving daredevils raised the temperature at the Carnival City Casino complex to high levels on Saturday evening. Veteran stuntman Enrico Schoeman rides a Harley-Davidson through a tunnel of fire, 1 July 2017, at Carnival City in Brakpan. The event also saw Andre de Kock crash a car through a pyramid of flaming cars. Picture: Michel Bega Taking to the venue s parking lot, veteran stuntmen Enrico Schoeman and The Citizen s Andr de Kock performed fire stunts that had spectators on their feet. Schoeman, right, was set alight, after which he rode a Gold Rand Harley-Davidson through two fire tunnels and a burning notice board. Straight afterwards, De Kock crashed a burning car through a pyramid of burning car wrecks. Both the rider and the driver escaped unscathed, but they left the parking lot slightly the worse for wear.

Picture: Michel Bega De Kock, 65, and Schoeman, 61, are the country s two longest surviving stuntmen, having been involved with fire risks for the past 42 years. The pair hold the current Guinness World Record for the longest motorcycle ride through a tunnel of fire, at 120 metres. They have recently been mandated to tackle the official Guinness World Record for riding a quadbike through a fire tunnel. The record attempt is scheduled to take place at next year s Wonderboom Airport Adrenaline Show on July 2.
