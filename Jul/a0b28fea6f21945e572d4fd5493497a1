In an ideal and just world, fans would rock up to Loftus on Saturday wearing armbands in protest of the Kings&#8217; expulsion from Super Rugby. By then the vaunted news would&#8217;ve been made official as the South African Rugby Union (Saru) is expected to announce which two sides have been chopped by Friday.

For much of the 2017 campaign, one of the talking points has been how Saru can contemplate ditching the Kings when they&#8217;re doing better than the Bulls. The numbers stack up. The Kings have won more matches than the Bulls, scored 13 more tries and have more log points (23 to 19). To be honest though, those cold hard stats are actually based on emotion. Given how brilliant the New Zealand conference is, you can&#8217;t really compare the Kings and Bulls. The Kings have played in the easier conference this year. However, it&#8217;s still not enough of a reason to wave away what they&#8217;ve achieved this year. What the Kings have illustrated in 2017 is that nothing beats good coaching. Under Davids, the Eastern Cape franchise hasn&#8217;t just developed an exciting brand of rugby. They&#8217;ve executed it well too and that testifies of players with potential who respond to their coach. And therein lies the great triumph: with a ragtag bunch of no-name brands, the Kings have become genuinely competitive. One really can&#8217;t help but wonder what could&#8217;ve happened if they had another one or two seasons together. We could&#8217;ve witnessed a story similar to the Lions. Also, it reflects very badly on the Bulls. Even in their reasonably compromised state, the men from Pretoria still boast talent the Kings could only dream of. It&#8217;s, frankly, embarrassing that they&#8217;ve done so poorly this year. Despite the obvious temptation of the Kings to want to rush into the weekend&#8217;s game to prove a point, Davids has remained the voice of reason. &#8220;It was a very tiring trip from Argentina back to South Africa. We know that for this week it is important that we build progressively into Saturday,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I hope that when we start the match everyone will be rested, energised and well-prepared so that we can be competitive against the Bulls.&#8221; We&#8217;re going to miss that wisdom next year.
