Contrary to reports last week, the Proteas won&#8217;t necessarily have a new head coach at the end of August. Incumbent Russell Domingo on Monday confirmed that he has indeed re-applied for his post. Also read: Who are the men (apparently) in line to coach the Proteas? &#8220;I have forwarded my application form and I did go through an interview process,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I can&#8217;t comment too much further on that because there&#8217;s obviously a process that needs to take place now.&#8221; Speculation over his future has been rife, especially after it was suggested that Domingo missed the June 16 deadline to submit his CV. And given his rather vague answer on when he actually decided to re-apply, it would seem it was in the nick of time. &#8220;I sent the relevant documentation before the due date,&#8221; said Domingo. &#8220;The when isn&#8217;t really important. Cricket South Africa (CSA) received my application before that deadline and that&#8217;s all that matters.&#8221; While the 43-year-old admits timing of the whole process &#8220;wasn&#8217;t ideal&#8221;, he made peace with the fact that the uncertainty over his position is &#8220;part and parcel of being a coach&#8221;. But he&#8217;s certainly more than willing to guide the Proteas to 2019&#8217;s World Cup. &#8220;I absolutely want to carry on,&#8221; said Domingo. &#8220;It&#8217;s a fantastic honour to work with this team and I&#8217;ve loved my time with them. Hopefully I can continue. If not, it&#8217;s also in the best interest of the team. It&#8217;s not my decision but I&#8217;ve loved every minute.&#8221; South Africa&#8217;s mentor has been playing a bit of cat and mouse with the local cricketing public ever since CSA announced its intention to advertise the post. The governing body insists they had to do so to comply with South African labour law, especially since Domingo has already been granted three contract extensions. Domingo, until now, has never really indicated his true intentions. What exactly then make him take so long to decide? &#8220;There were a whole host of things I had to consider. I had to think about family time, I had to believe I&#8217;m the right person to still coach the team and I also needed player support,&#8221; said Domingo. Domingo is locked in a battle with six other candidates, which includes Highveld Lions mentor Geoff Toyana and former Titans coach Rob Walter.
