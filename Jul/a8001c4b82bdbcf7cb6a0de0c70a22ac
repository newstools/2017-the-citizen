Kinaan, who is looking to give Mike de Kock his third successive eLan Gold Cup victory, has shortened to 7-2 at Betting World for Sunday s R1.25-million over 3200m at Greyville. The Gold Cup and the two Grade 1 juvenile features over 1600m the Premiers Champions Stakes and the Thekwini Stakes for fillies take place on Sunday while the Grade 1 World Sports Betting Champions Cup over 1800m will be run on Saturday in the two-day Gold Cup Festival Of Racing. De Kock won the Grade 3 Gold Cup in 2015 with Wild One and last year Enaad came out on top. Kinaan finished third last year, beaten 1.50 lengths by his stable companion, and De Kock always said his charge would be better as a four-year-old. Hermoso Mundo, who won the Gold Vase on an objection on 1 July, is second favourite at 5-1 with Captain Splendid, the horse who had the Gold Vase taken away from him, at 6-1 along with Durban July fourth-placed Krambambuli. Durban July hero Marinaresco is reported by Gold Circle to be very much on target for Saturday s Greyville showpiece. Candice bass-Robinson said: He was on easy work for two weeks or so after the July. He doesn t take a lot but he worked last week and will do so again this week. He is fit and well, and ready to go. The Durban July, although completed in fast time, was marked by a moderate early gallop and Mrs Robinson said: I think the race could be run differently this time with different tactics but it all depends on what they do with Captain America and on whether he goes to the front. It would suit us to have a pace.
