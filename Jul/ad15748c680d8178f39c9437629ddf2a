The South African juve nile racing programme is set to come to an ex citing close at Greyville in Durban on Sunday, 30 July when the country s top two-year-old thoroughbreds compete in the final Grade 1 races of the season. The young horses will compete in the Premiers Champion Stakes and the Thekwini Stakes for fil lies. Each race carries a stake of R750,000 and is run over 1600m. Exciting entries have been re ceived for both races and South Africa s champion trainer, Sean Tarry, will be hoping to follow up on his juvenile success on Vo dacom Durban July day when he saddled the winners of both two-year-old events, Desert Rhythm in the Golden Slipper and Purple Di amond in the Golden Horseshoe. Desert Rhythm, who had won the Nursery at Turffontein be fore her Greyville success, will be strongly fancied to take honours on eLan Gold Cup day and Purple Diamond, who won the Durban Golden Horseshoe as a 20-1 out side, will command a lot more re spect in the Premiers Champion Stakes. Tarry has also nominated Sev enth Rock filly Rockin Russian, fourth in the Golden Slipper, for the Thekwini Stakes, and as back-up to Purple Diamond in the Champion Stakes, Captain Al colt Captain And Master who finished third in the Golden Horseshoe. However, the stable will be wary of Twice Over colt Sand And Sea who was a comfortable winner of the Grade 1 Tsogo Sun Gold Me dallion over 1200m at Scottsville. Sea And Sand is from the Dennis Drier yard and beat Al Mariachi on debut. Brett Crawford s charge went on to win the KZN Yearling Sale Million at Greyville on Dur ban July day. But the challenge to the Tarry stable in the Premiers Champion Stakes does not stop there. Train er Joey Ramsden has entered his Oratorio colt Ancestry who was just touched off by Purple Dia mond in the Golden Horseshoe. This colt will have a better draw than those mentioned and will be a big runner. In the Thekwini Stakes, Desert Rhythm will again face Lucky Houdalakis-trained Let It Flow and Tsessebe from the Drier sta ble, second and third respectively in the Golden Slipper. In this case, however, Desert Rhythm will have a major draw advantage. Duncan Howells-trained Nep tune s Rain, third to Brave Mary in the Allan Robertson Fillies Championship at Scottsville, will be out to prove she is a lot bet ter than her disappointing run in the Golden Slipper while Dean Kannemeyer-trained Meryl, who won the Devon Air Stakes, can prove that performance was no fluke. These two races could deter mine the winners of the juvenile categories at the Equus Awards next month. &#8211; Gold Circle Entries for the R750,000 Premiers Champion Stakes (Grade 1) over 1600m at Greyville on Sunday 30 July 8 ANCESTRY (J Ramsden) 60.0 16 BIG BEAR (S G Tarry) 60.0 14 BORYA (G H Van Zyl) 60.0 9 CAPTAIN AND MASTER (S G Tarry) 60.0 10 CAT&#8217;S LEGACY (A Wright) 60.0 11 CHANTYMAN (D S Bosch) 60.0 7 EYES WIDE OPEN (G S Kotzen) 60.0 19 FULL MAST (M G Azzie) 60.0 3 LEFTRIGHTGOODNIGHT (J A Soma) 60.0 5 LESLIE SHADOWLINER (R A Hill) 60.0 17 MONKS HOOD (A D Gordon) 60.0 13 MORNING CATCH (J Ramsden) 60.0 6 MUJALLAD (M F De Kock) 60.0 20 OPERA ROYAL (G S Kotzen) 60.0 1 PACK LEADER (G S Kotzen) 60.0 12 PURPLE DIAMOND (S G Tarry) 60.0 15 SAND AND SEA (D R Drier) 60.0 2 SEA KING (G S Kotzen) 60.0 18 TROJAN HARBOUR (G van Zyl) 60.0 4 WARRIOR&#8217;S REST (S G Tarry) 60.0 Entries for the R750,000 Thekwini Stakes (Grade 1) over 1600m at Greyville on Sunday 30 July 19 AURELIA COTTA (S G Tarry) 60.0 27 BARBIE DOLL (G H Van Zyl) 60.0 29 BRAXTON (M N Houdalakis) 60.0 8 BRIDAL VEIL (C Laird) 60.0 6 DESERT RHYTHM (S G Tarry) 60.0 10 FLICHITY BY FARR (A Wright) 60.0 21 FLYING FABLE (M G Azzie) 60.0 20 FOLK DANCE (P A Peter) 60.0 4 FREDERICO&#8217;S DREAM (M G Azzie) 60.0 5 GREEN ICE (A Wright) 60.0 2 HOLLY&#8217;S VISION (G van Zyl) 60.0 15 ILLEGAL (C Dawson) 60.0 13 JUST MY STYLE (G H Van Zyl) 60.0 1 LA BELLA MIA (W H Marwing) 60.0 17 LADY IN BLACK (D R Drier) 60.0 31 LET IT FLOW (M N Houdalakis) 60.0 12 LUNA CHILD (G S Kotzen) 60.0 30 MARA (D Kannemeyer) 60.0 25 MARSALA (M L Roberts) 60.0 18 MERYL (D Kannemeyer) 60.0 28 MIZIARA (D C Howells) 60.0 26 NEPTUNE&#8217;S RAIN (D C Howells) 60.0 9 ON THE BOUNCE (C Laird) 60.0 24 PRINCESS PEACH (G S Kotzen) 60.0 3 ROCKIN RUSSIAN (S G Tarry) 60.0 16 SEQUINED (V H Marshall) 60.0 7 SORCERESS (D C Howells) 60.0 23 SPRING BREEZE (M G Azzie) 60.0 11 TOO PHAT TO FLY (G S Kotzen) 60.0 14 TORREY PINES (J J van Vuuren) 60.0 22 TSESSEBE (D R Drier) 60.0 Would you like to place a bet on the horses?
