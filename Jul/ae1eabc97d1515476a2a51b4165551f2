The Stormers are going to try and end their Super Rugby playoff curse by picking the two Damians &#8211; Willemse and De Allende &#8211; as their main organisers in the backline. Both have made their marks at flyhalf and inside centre respectively the past two weeks but Saturday&#8217;s quarterfinal against the Chiefs at Newlands represents a massive challenge.

Willemse is a 19-year-old prodigy but he&#8217;s still very inexperienced. De Allende has only recently returned from injury and is still regaining match fitness and his touch. Yet perhaps the biggest factor is whether the duo have a better understanding of each other&#8217;s game. De Allende sounds cautiously optimistic about that. &#8220;It&#8217;s just been nice for us trying to blend in and find each other,&#8221; said the Springboks centre. &#8220;We&#8217;re trying to connect but I do think there&#8217;s an understanding that&#8217;s developing. We both have the right mindset. The attacking shape we&#8217;re trying to play also benefits us.&#8221; Willemse has been hailed as the flyhalf the Stormers have been yearning for for years and his teammate believes he&#8217;s already growing in stature. &#8220;I think he is a talker, a communicator on the field,&#8221; said De Allende. &#8220;Once he&#8217;s settled, he&#8217;ll probably be a big talker. But Damian is still a youngster. We just need to back him.&#8221; Coach Robbie Fleck is far more emphatic over the Willemse&#8217;s suitability to take on the New Zealand giants. &#8220;He&#8217;s been outstanding,&#8221; said the Stormers mentor. &#8220;He brings a different dynamic to our attack. Damian&#8217;s a tough boy and gets stuck in. We&#8217;ve got belief in him. I have no problem picking him.&#8221; Concerns over whether the responsibility of goalkicking will place unnecessary pressure on Willemse have also been eased by the return of reliable fullback SP Marais. &#8220;SP has had an outstanding season and he&#8217;s also kicked really well. We have options,&#8221; said Fleck. For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter. Would you like to place a rugby bet? Click here to get started in 3 easy steps.
