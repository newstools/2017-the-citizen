It seems even more people are stuck in Durban after spending all their cash on Durban July parties forgetting they still need to get home. This may just be developing into a meme now. An alleged screenshot of a conversation between a Durban July attendee and her friend, Palesa, has emerged and is as hilarious as the first. This person appears to have had all the fun you can handle over the weekend and posted videos and pictures of herself living the high life in Durban on social media, but now the posts have backfired. She allegedly told her friend she had to go to Durban to visit her sister in hospital. The good news is that the little sister is fine, but the friend was still stuck in Durban on Tuesday. &#8220;Can you please help me with some money for a flight back to Joburg? &#8220;I will really appreciate this forever if you do this for me, please, please, I beg of you,&#8221; she said. Seeing that her friend was unwilling to help out, the friend added that even a mere R3 500 just to get home would do. Palesa did not buy her friend&#8217;s story. &#8220;Ask those brothers who were buying that champopo you were drinking in your Insta stories on Sunday,&#8221; she said. Check out the conversation, which has obviously not been authenticated, below: . . On Tuesday, screenshots of a conversation between a Durban July attendee, also asking for money to fly back to Joburg, emerged and left many wondering how many more people attended the event without properly planning for it.
