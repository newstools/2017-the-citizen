Not one to wait to be celebrated, Papa Penny has taken it upon himself to honour his own legacy by unveiling a statue in his hometown in Limpopo. He shared an image on Instagram of the statue which is clad in a bright red suit and has his signature hairstyle. Speaking to Tshisa LIVE, Papa Penny said he would rather honour himself now then wait for others to do so. &#8220;It is my legacy. I decided to build it now because I don&#8217;t want them to build me one when I am dead and I&#8217;m not able to see it. They must honour me while I am still alive. The statue sits alongside several other statues of animals and is a big hit with the community. &#8220;Everyone is so happy. They love it. My family likes it and the community are so excited they are speechless,&#8221; he said.
