If you buy a new Suzuki today, you will see the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo and the 2022 Soccer World Cup in Qatar come and go before you have to consider extending its mechanical warranty. Suzuki South Africa has launched a new, 200 000km or five-year mechanical warranty on its entire passenger vehicle range sold from July until December 2017. This promotion replaces the current three-year or 100 000km warranty and is included in the vehicle s price. Over the past few years, we have worked really hard to further improve our customer service and extend our dealer network to place good Suzuki service within the reach of more South Africans. We have also improved our warranty and service plans to be both easy to understand and as comprehensive as possible. The extension to five years or 200 000km signals the successful completion of the project, says Andr Venter, divisional head for sales and marketing at Suzuki South Africa. The new mechanical warranty will guarantee the perfect operation of every Suzuki and will cover all costs in the case of a mechanical failure, barring failures resulting from abuse, a lack of scheduled maintenance or a vehicle accident. In making sure we offer the most benefit to our customers, we have extended our partnership with the Automobile Association (AA) to offer five years of free roadside assistance, says Venter. The partnership will extend beyond its breakdown service and include services such as help with changing a flat tyre, jump starting a flat battery and car lock out support, emergency fuel and even telephonic directions. The AA will even relay messages to your friends and family in the case of an emergency. At Suzuki, we always talk about Care! It stands for Customers are really everything! and it is at the heart of all our efforts, says Venter.
