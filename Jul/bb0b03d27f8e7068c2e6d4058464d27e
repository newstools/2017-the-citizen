Bonang and Somizi s friendship ended last year after Somizi reportedly told DJ Zinhle about her affair with AKA. Bonang says they are &#8220;cool&#8221;, but do not hang out together. In an interview with TshisaLIVE recently, she said she and Somizi were colleagues, but were not friends. &#8220;We are professionals. At the end of the day, we are in the same industry, and we are often in the same spaces. The industry is so small, and we know that we are going to bump into each other. &#8220;We greet each other. We are very polite. I don&#8217;t try to disrespect him, but that is where it ends. We are not friends,&#8221; she said. Both just published their books, and their books detail the split. Somizi s book does not reveal too much about the fallout, but Bonang mentions Somizi a few times in her book. &#8220;He is mentioned in the book, but you will have to wait to read what exactly is said about him,&#8221; she said.
