Parliament s portfolio committee on police on Wednesday said it would summon the acting head of the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (DPCI), more commonly known as the Hawks, to the legislature to explain how its headquarters in Pretoria were burgled. The committee finds it difficult to comprehend how this burglary occurred in an office that has a responsibility to fight organised and serious crimes, said committee chairman Francois Beukman. There s a lot at stake here and we want the acting head to brief the committee about this serious breach. Lieutenant-General Yolisa Matakata, who took over as acting Hawks head after a court disqualified Berning Ntlemeza, the controversial former DPCI head, from holding public office, condemned the incident. Hawks spokesman Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi said in a statement Matakata had assured all and sundry that a crack team will foresee the investigation in this regard . Mulaudzi confirmed that thieves had broken down locked doors and stolen computers containing supply chain, human resources and finance documents. Intensive investigations are under way following the break-in at certain offices of the Hawks Head Office buildings in Silverton, Pretoria, he said. Investigators are currently working on the scene, and more information will be communicated in due course. Mulaudzi added no case dockets had gone missing.
