On Saturday, a sports journalist sent out a desperate Tweet: &#8220;If someone finds Elton Jantjies kicking boots, please rush them urgently to Ellis Park.&#8221; It was graveyard humour at a time when it looked entirely possible that the Lions would lose to the Sharks in the Super Rugby quarterfinal and Jantjies was having an absolute nightmare. Yet, history records a Lions victory in the end, although only by the narrowest of margins. It was left to fullback Ruan Combrinck to goal a 60-metre penalty with just two minutes left on the clock. So, the Lions squeaked into the semis, 23-21. It wasn t pretty, but we ll take it because it s our boys who will take on the Hurricanes next week. And it will be a home final at Ellis Park. The Lions scared us more than they have for a long time and they will be the first to admit it was a very bad day at the office. There were too many schoolboy errors in handling as well as some idiotic tactical decisions. Do that against the Hurricanes and you ll get punished. Yet it s good to know that, even playing badly, the Lions can beat the best in South Africa, so bring on the Kiwis!
