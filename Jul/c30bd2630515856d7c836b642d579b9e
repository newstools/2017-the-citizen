A moment of inexperience has cost the Proteas Kagiso Rabada for the second Test against England starting next week. The exciting 22-year-old quick has been suspended by the International Cricket Council (ICC) after swearing at Ben Stokes when he dismissed him during the opening day of the first Test at Lord&#8217;s on Thursday. Also read: It s a glass half-full (or empty) day for the Proteas Rabada had bounced out the English all-rounder and then was clearly heard on a television microphone telling him to &#8220;f*** off&#8221;. &#8220;Thursday&#8217;s incident related to Rabada using inappropriate language after dismissing England batsman Ben Stokes. It was audible over the stump microphones and also resulted in the batsman to turn before walking off the field,&#8221; the ICC said in a statement. As a result, the Proteas bowler breached article 2.1.7 of the ICC&#8217;s code of conduct for players. He has been fined 15% of his match fee but, more importantly, picked up another demerit point. Rabada has now picked up four demerit points over a two-year period, which translates into a one-match ban in Tests. The youngster had previously been slapped with three demerit points in February after an altercation with Sri Lankan opener Niroshan Dickwella in an ODI at Newlands. &#8220;Rabada admitted the offence on Friday afternoon and accepted the sanction proposed by match referee Jeff Crowe. There was no need for a formal hearing,&#8221; said the ICC. The Proteas will now have to consider the inexperienced Knights quick Duanne Olivier for the Test in Nottingham or opt for the all-round expertise of Chris Morris.
