Police Minister Fikile Mbalula took time out from his busy schedule in Singapore on Thursday to comment on the drama between Rob Kardashian and Blac Chyna that has been the talk of the Twitter streets since Wednesday. Rob Kardashian, Kim Kardashian&#8217;s brother, went on a rant yesterday exposing his ex-girlfriend and baby mama on Instagram, and even leaked her nudes. Rob alleged Chyna had cheated on him with more than six men in the past week and took all of them to the house he bought for her. This after all the money he spent buying her flashy cars and jewellery. Rob went on to share a video of Chyna in a hospital, and said she had lied to everyone about her baby weight loss. Though she told people she had exercised and used products she went on to advertise for money, Rob said Chyna lost all that weight through surgery that he paid $100 000 for. He then leaked her nudes, which have since been deleted from Instagram. Since then, there have been reports that Blac Chyna was considering legal action against her baby daddy. The drama shook social media users, who criticised Rob for exposing his baby mama like that. One of those is our very own Mbalula, who seems to be up to date with all the latest scandals on social media. Mbalula was so disgusted by what Rob did that he could not keep it to himself. Taking to Twitter, he wrote: &#8220;The Kardashian guy Rob whatever, He is such a &#8230;.disaster,&#8221; a comment that, in turn, landed him in hot water with followers.
