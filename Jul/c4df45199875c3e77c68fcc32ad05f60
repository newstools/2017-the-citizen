Khoza was sent a series of texts on WhatsApp telling her that she had 21 days to live. Her family was also threatened and she was warned that during the upcoming debate on a motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma, she should vote against it and withdraw all the statements she has made about his leadership and corruption in the media recently. Daily Maverick reports that the number which sent the threats was registered to BLF. This was confirmed by The Regulation of Interception of Communications and Provision of Communication-related Information Act (Rica). Mngxitama denied this, telling the news website &#8216;BLF do not threaten other black people. We have a policy of dealing with sellouts and house negroes, but we won&#8217;t ever threaten their lives.&#8217; This is a white person trying to use our name. We won&#8217;t threaten Makhosi Khoza, she&#8217;s not a politically interesting person to us. It is definitely not our number. We have a Telkom line, Mngxitama added.
