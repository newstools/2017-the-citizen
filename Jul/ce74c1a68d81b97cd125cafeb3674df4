A seriously injured man, believed to be in his 30s, spent almost three hours trapped in his wrecked car after he crashed into the back of a truck on the R21 near the Benoni off-ramp in Ekurhuleni early on Saturday morning, paramedics said. At about 3am, paramedics from ER24, the fire department, and the South African National Roads Agency Limited (Sanral) emergency services arrived on the scene where they found the car almost completely wedged underneath the rear of the truck, ER24 spokesman Werner Vermaak said. Paramedics could barely gain access to him, but managed to treat him until he could be removed from the wreckage. Once freed, he was reassessed and treated for his injuries before paramedics rushed him to Tembisa Hospital. Paramedics explained that it took almost three hours to free the man from the wreckage. The exact circumstances surrounding the crash are not yet known, Vermaak said. African News Agency (ANA)
