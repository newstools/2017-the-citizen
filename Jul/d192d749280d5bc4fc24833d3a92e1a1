Mr Fill Up, Cassper Nyovest, has been living it up in Ibiza. He travelled to the popular party island in the Mediterranean for the #OnArrival campaign by Ciroc. Nyovest was announced as the new ambassador of the alcohol brand early this year, and the deal was rumoured to be worth more than R30 million. The rapper has been documenting his entire trip on social media, from posting about living the good life on a R68 million yacht to nights spent at nightclubs with international stars such as Paris Hilton, who told him he smells good. Nyovest gushed about his encounter with Hilton on Twitter all weekend and even posted a video of his encounter. &#8220;Paris Hilton just told me I smell good!!! Boys, I&#8217;ve made it hey!!!
