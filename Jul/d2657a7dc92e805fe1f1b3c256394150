Lopez on Tuesday released a video for her single &#8220;Ni Tu Ni Yo&#8221; (&#8220;Neither You Nor Me&#8221;), which opens with her sitting at a table as Marc Anthony enters to welcome her. The fellow singer embraces his ex-wife and compliments her on her watch before introducing her to a photographer who, throughout the video, takes glamour shots as Lopez poses before various backdrops. The track, driven by a reggaeton beat and horn section, also credits Marc Anthony &#8212; a frequent artistic collaborator of Lopez before and during their marriage &#8212; as a songwriter. Lopez premiered &#8220;Ni Tu Ni Yo&#8221; last week during the annual Macy&#8217;s fireworks show for the July 4 holiday in her native New York. The song is her first track off &#8220;Por Primera Vez&#8221; (&#8220;For the First Time&#8221;), which will come out on September 29 and mark the bilingual star&#8217;s second album mostly in Spanish following 2007&#8217;s &#8220;Como Ama una Mujer&#8221; (&#8220;The Way a Woman Loves.&#8221;) Lopez became an international superstar starting in the late 1990s with R&amp;B-touched dance hits such as &#8220;If You Had My Love,&#8221; &#8220;Waiting for Tonight&#8221; and &#8220;I&#8217;m Real.&#8221; While she has maintained a loyal fan base, her last album, 2014&#8217;s &#8220;A.K.A.,&#8221; fared worse commercially than her earlier albums. Lopez, 47, was married to salsa megastar and fellow New Yorker of Puerto Rican descent Anthony, 48, for a decade starting in 2004, with Lopez giving birth to twins in 2008. Lopez&#8217;s personal life has frequently featured in the tabloids. She most recently has been dating baseball great Alex Rodriguez, a Dominican-American New Yorker.
