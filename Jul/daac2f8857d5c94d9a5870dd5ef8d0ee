Mitsubishi Motors South Africa (MMSA) will be introducing its highly-acclaimed allnew Pajero Sport in September 2017. This stylishly designed new-generation Mitsubishi sport utility offers refined driving dynamics thanks to an array of cutting-edge technological enhancements, including a stateof-the-art eight-speed automatic transmission. The addition of various new driver and passenger luxuries and comforts make the all-new Pajero Sport an everyday pleasure to drive be it tight city corners, maddening highways or any other dirt or off-road surface. The genuinely exemplary driving behaviour of the new Pajero Sport is primarily due to the flawless combination of its impressive high performance, new-generation aluminium cylinder block turbo-diesel engine and its modern high-tech eight-speed automatic transmission (including transfer gearing with low range for the four-wheel drive derivative). The four-wheel drive derivative also boasts the latest edition of Mitsubishi s unique Super-Select II-4 4WD-system. Boasting Mitsubishi s stylish Dynamic Shield front-end design, the striking Pajero Sport shows off its elegant and contemporary design lines which ooze a demanding presence on the road. The all-new Pajero Sport is the ultimate sport utility vehicle for the modern-day adventurer. Its excellently refined driving dynamics, sophisticated design and impressive road presence, combined with luxurious car-like comfort and exceptional space, as well as Pajero s iconic brand admirability will undoubtedly ignite that spirit for adventure that forms part of each and every South African.
