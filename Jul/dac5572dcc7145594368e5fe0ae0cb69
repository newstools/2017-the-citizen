The contentious issue of state capture, allegedly by the politically connected Gupta family, was not discussed at the ANC s peace and stability commission, State Security Minister David Mahlobo said on Tuesday. Mahlobo, a member of the governing party s peace and stability subcommittee, briefed the media on outcomes of commission discussions at the African National Congress 5th national policy conference held in Nasrec, Johannesburg. Mahlobo s assessment was that the Gupta family, accused of having influence and power over government and state-owned enterprises, do not pose a threat to the country s sovereignty. We chose to discuss policy, not events or incidents remember this is a policy conference, Mahlobo told reporters. Corruption is a cancer and should be dealt with as a member of the ANC [National Executive Committee] NEC, I know we have taken a decision and said the president or government should proceed [to establish ] a commission of inquiry into state capture. He added that there should be a way to mitigate the relationship between politicians and business . Well some of us might have friends in business, but do they control how we do things, how we think? There s no one here who has no friend in business but we say generally a decision was taken and outcomes should be implemented.
