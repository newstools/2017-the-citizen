With the tax filing season officially opened today, taxpayers who find themselves at odds with Sars are encouraged to approach the office of the tax ombudsman (OTO) to resolve tax-related disputes. &#8220;In fact we don&#8217;t only focus on individual taxpayer assessment queries, we can mediate in all tax functions at Sars, such as customs,&#8221; says CEO Adv Eric Mkhawane. Taxpayers must have exhausted all their options with Sars unless there are extenuating circumstances, or the taxpayer is convinced that Sars has acted with prejudice against them. Mkhawane says the OTO, established in terms of the Tax Administration Act, will only deal with complaints relating to procedure and service and administrative issues, and they have access to the taxpayer electronic system and can therefore immediately determine the complaint&#8217;s details. &#8220;We cannot, for instance, adjudicate in cases where a taxpayer is disputing tax policies or specific sections of the tax act; in those cases they have to use different mechanisms to resolve the matter,&#8221; Adv Mkhawane said. Although the recommendations of the tax ombudsman are not binding and can be challenged by Sars, the tax collector has to &#8220;provide reasons in writing within 30 days&#8221;. &#8220;This obligation enables OTO to make those reasons public by publishing them in the annual report or provide them to Parliament.&#8221; Mkhawane said at first OTO gave itself &#8220;15 days to resolve taxpayer complaints, but the turnaround period now depends on the complexity of the case and, where it takes longer, the taxpayer will be kept informed of developments in the investigation of the case&#8221;. However, Mkhawane said that the ombud was not entirely satisfied with being dependent on Sars as this &#8220;poses reputational risks&#8221; and it would be approaching Parliament to seek independence from Sars. &#8220;The ombudsman is appointed by the minister, and according to the legislation, all other appointments must be made in consultation with the Sars commissioner. Expenditure for the office must also be derived from the Sars budget, the very same institution we must scrutinise. &#8220;We want that clause removed from the act so we are completely independent and our budget is approved by the minister of finance. We would be advocating for promulgation of the Tax Ombudsman Act,&#8221; he said. To expedite the process of delinking Sars and the OTO, Adv Mkhawane says they will be submitting a &#8220;business case&#8221; to Treasury, developing taxpayers&#8217; bill of rights as well signing a memorandum of understanding and service charter with Sars to ensure there are no delays in response to complaints.
