A taxi driver was arrested in Walvis Bay, Namibia, on Saturday for shooting a client who jumped out of his taxi and ran away without paying. The 40-year-old suspect was charged with attempted murder and is expected to appear in the Walvis Bay Magistrate s Court on Monday. Linginus Shaatoi Shavuka, 29, was admitted to the Walvis Bay State Hospital with a gunshot wound on the right shoulder. His condition is stable. Police Deputy Commissioner Erastus Iikuyu said on Sunday that Shavuka and another man allegedly jumped out of the taxi and made a run for it when the driver slowed down at the traffic lights along Nathaniel Maxuilili Street in Kuisebmond. The driver chased after them and shot Shavuka with a pistol. The firearm, licensed to the driver, was confiscated. Iikuyu said the driver laid a case of theft under false pretences against the two men for failing to pay for his services. Police investigations are underway in both cases.
