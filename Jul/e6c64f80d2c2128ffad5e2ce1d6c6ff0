An enthusiastic President Jacob Zuma on Monday said he was captivated by the quality of debate at the ongoing 5th national policy conference of the African National Congress. We had a good start and also the good size [numbers of delegates], as you have seen. We are proud. We are big, we are a big organisation, and we have delegates that are there. The opening was absolutely wonderful, and thereafter we discussed the documents that had been presented up to yesterday [Sunday], Zuma said while briefly addressing journalists during his walkabout in the Nasrec Expo Centre, south of Johannesburg. What impressed me more is the quality of the debate. I think it has gone up, particularly if you listen to the stalwarts, the youth in particular and the delegates in general. They are really focused, and I think up to yesterday we discussed all the things we wanted to discuss. The fact that this time we had more days [for the conference] gave us an opportunity to have more debate, so there is more clarity, time to clarify issues. Zuma did not take any questions after his interaction with the media, and was escorted away by several bodyguards. Security remained tight at the ANC event, with numerous bodyguards escorting senior government officials and several police officers screening people entering the premises.
