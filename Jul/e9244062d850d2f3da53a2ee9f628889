Under-fire Eskom chief financial officer Anoj Singh knew about payments to Trillian Capital Partners, a Gupta-linked company. Eskom&#8217;s interim chairperson and acting CEO both confirmed never having a contractual agreement with Trillian, despite it being remunerated R495 million in 2016. According to Business Day, &#8220;new evidence&#8221; has uncovered that Singh undertook a number of trips, including one between 17-24 December 2015, staying at the Oberoi Hotel in Dubai. It is reported the Guptas paid for the trip. Oberoi Hotel, a luxurious skyscraper that has become synonymous with state capture foot soldiers, was evidently a hotel of choice for Singh as he checked in during four other trips between 6 June 2014 and February 2015. The publication revealed that &#8220;on at least one occasion he was with Rajesh Gupta and his stay at the Oberoi Hotel was paid for by the Guptas&#8217; Sahara [Computers]&#8221; &#8211; the timing of the trips coincided with Trillian becoming the &#8220;supplier development partner&#8221; for McKinsey. Singh is also believed to have have direct knowledge of the Trillian payments as early as February 2016, &#8220;nearly two months before the first payment of R30.6 million&#8221; was effected despite no legally binding contract existing between the two entities.
