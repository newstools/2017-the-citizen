Zahara&#8217;s new man, Ian Sibiya is 23-years old and five years younger than her. Despite the age gap, the couple are madly inlove and gave a tell-all interview about their romance in the latest Drum magazine. They met at a braai and felt an instant connection, striking up a friendship and deciding to date shortly thereafter. I couldn t believe we both fell in love so quickly. Ian is such a gentleman. He doesn t come to the house without a gift. People will say I said the same about Amaza but I honestly believe Ian is the one. On the age gap, Zahara says she believes Ian is mature so she doesn&#8217;t feel the age difference. I was actually shocked to find out he s 23. The age difference doesn t change anything Ian is very mature and he respects me so much. He speaks to me like I m a queen. He has his own career and doesn t depend on me either. Ian told the magazine that as long as he can provide for his woman as a man should, then the age gap was inconsequential.
