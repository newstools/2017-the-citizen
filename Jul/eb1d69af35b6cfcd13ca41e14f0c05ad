Sibanye Gold has appointed Chris Bateman as executive vice-president of United States region to head and lead the team at the Stillwater Operations. In May, Sibanye completed the acquisition of Stillwater, the United States&#8217; sole provider of platinum and palladium, for $2.2 billion (about R30 billion), in a bid to create a premier global precious metals miner. Bateman has served as chief financial officer at Stillwater Mining Company since 2014. Prior to that, he worked in the mining industry for more than 18 years, gaining broad and diverse experience in the platinum, palladium, copper, uranium, diamonds and industrial minerals sectors. Bateman also served as chief financial officer at Turquoise Hill Resources, Rio Tinto diamonds and minerals product group, Rio Tinto iron and titanium product group and Energy Resources of Australia. He has served on the boards of Richards Bay Minerals in South Africa, Oyu Tolgoi copper mine in Mongolia and QIT Madagascar Minerals in Madagascar. Sibanye said outgoing Stillwater chief executive, Mick McMullen, will transition into the role of technical advisor until the end of 2018, thereby ensuring management and operational continuity and facilitating the integration of Stillwater into Sibanye. Sibanye chief executive, Neal Froneman, said they were delighted to welcome Bateman as head of the US region. Chris extensive industry knowledge and experience will strengthen the Sibanye executive team and his collaborative leadership style and broad experience at executive level will facilitate a smooth integration of Stillwater into the broader Sibanye Group, Froneman said.
