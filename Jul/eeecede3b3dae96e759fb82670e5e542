Two learners from Ramogabudi Secondary School in Mokopane, Limpopo, have impressed American rapper Nicki Minaj after a video of them rapping to her hit song Nobody went viral. In a video, viewed more than 1.5 million times on Minaj&#8217;s Instagram page, one of the girls, in school uniform, raps, while the other, also in school uniform, dances in support of her friend. &#8220;What country are these girls from? This really inspired me. Music transcends all borders. &#x1f64f;&#x1f3fd; UPDATE: #SouthAfrica represent,&#8221; she wrote. Watch the video below: I got smthn inside of me that can&#8217;t be quenched. I&#8217;m addicted to winning &amp; I can&#8217;t be benched. Go to war for every black queen that they lynched. And my pockets on chubby but they can&#8217;t be pinched. &#x1f44a;&#x1f3fd; After they use you, then they abuse you. Then they get mad when they lose you. Excuse you?!?! U know the liar will accuse you! You know the Queen still reign, it&#8217;s just business as usual! &#x1f5e3; anything I touch, I bless it. Track record so impressive. Opened the billboard awards w/a hit record. The devil thought he had me!

A post shared by Nicki Minaj (@nickiminaj) on Jul 3, 2017 at 1:30pm PDT While some asked the rapper to feature the girls in one of her songs, most South Africans called for her return to the country. &#8220;Nicki you should know just how huge your fan base is especially in south Africa. Last time you were in South Africa, I could see just how surprised you were because you never thought it would be that massive.
