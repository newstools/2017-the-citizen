A man was killed and five other people injured late Wednesday when their house caught alight on Hamilton Road in Rustenburg. ER24 Spokesperson Russel Meiring said when paramedics arrived shortly after 22h00 firefighters had already extinguished the blaze. When firefighters later walked through the home, they found the body of a man lying inside one of the rooms. Unfortunately, the man had already succumbed to his multiple injuries, said Meiring on Thursday morning. He said five other people suffered burn wounds. Two of them a man and a woman were in a critical condition. Paramedics treated them on the scene and provided the critically injured with advanced life support interventions. One critically injured patient was later airlifted by a medical helicopter to a private hospital in Johannesburg while the four others were transported to nearby hospitals, said Meiring. The cause of the fire is being investigated.
