Justin Snaith, bidding for his fourth Final Fling Stakes winner in five seasons, has nominated the smart A Time To Dream for the 1 800m Grade 3 at Kenilworth on Saturday 22 July. The four-year-old was considered good enough to take on Grade 1 company in the Klawervlei Majorca and, although she finished eighth, was little more than 3.50 lengths o winner Nightingale. Snaith has also entered Harvard Crimson who finished fourth in last month s Listed Ladies Mile. A Time To Dream is the joint highest rated (on 102) with the Mike Robinson-trained Good- time Gal who won the Grade 3 CTS Victress Stakes in December, finished third in the Klawervlei Majorca and fifth in the Ladies Mile. Glen Kotzen, whose Final Fling winners include Rosey Rapids (2002), Escapology at 50-1 (2006) and Cash Register (2012), relies on Silvan Star who ran out a convincing winner of the Ladies Mile. Andre Nel s stable is in good form and there will be a lot of interest in Ngaga (a half-sister to Igugu), not least because she was second in the Ladies Mile and the Listed Stormsvlei Mile a er winning all her first three starts. Another notable is the Glen Puller-trained Harlem Shake who sprang a 12-1 surprise in last year s race. The race is con ned to fillies and mares and is run at weight- for-age with penalties for Graded winners (Grade 3 &#8211; 1kg extra and Grade 2 &#8211; 2kg extra). There is a supplementary entry stage on Friday with declarations on Monday 17 July. Entries for the R250,000 Final Fling Stakes (Grade 3) over 1800m at Kenilworth on Saturday 22 July.
