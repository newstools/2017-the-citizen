Despite the Lions hogging the spotlight again with a record victory over the clueless Sunwolves, it was pretty heartening that their players weren&#8217;t the only ones to shine. In fact, having one team dominate so clearly isn&#8217;t a sign of a healthy game. As a result, we&#8217;re pretty chuffed that the Bulls feature again. 15 &#8211; Warrick Gelant (Bulls) The former Junior Springbok star has found his attacking verve again. He ran beautiful line for his hat-trick of tries and even defended stoutly. A massive talent with genuine X-factor. 14 &#8211; Cheslin Kolbe (Stormers) The diminutive playmaker reminded everyone of his try-scoring ability with a hat-trick in Bloemfontein. But it was his stable goalkicking &#8211; even though it&#8217;s not his forte &#8211; that kept the Stormers ahead against spirited opponents. He truly looked like a senior pro. 13 &#8211; Jesse Kriel (Bulls) He continues to prosper with his Springbok partner on his inside but what was really impressive was his tackling. Kriel completed 11 (one of them dominant), didn&#8217;t miss a single one and even made two turnovers. That&#8217;s the type of &#8220;unfashionable&#8221; work you want a midfielder to do too. 12 &#8211; Jan Serfontein (Bulls) This man is currently the best backline player in South African rugby. And his stats said it all: 65 running meters, three try-assists, three turnovers and 11 tackles. World class. 11 &#8211; Makazole Mapimpi (Kings) Brilliant once again in a backline that oozes confidence. The Cheetahs seem to bought themselves a star for next season. 10 &#8211; Elton Jantjies (Lions) The Springbok flyhalf can do no wrong at the moment. And it seems he&#8217;s actually picked up a bit of pace. 9 &#8211; Ross Cronje (Lions) It wasn&#8217;t a particularly taxing game to play in but Cronje never looked complacent. Instead, he simply maintained his high standards. 8 &#8211; Andisa Ntsila (Kings) At stages his overeager nature gets the better of him, but his link play is outstanding and he&#8217;s not afraid to get his hands dirty. 7 &#8211; Kwagga Smith (Lions) A spectacular performance from the Blitzboks star. In an open game, his superior attacking skills as a seasoned sevens players was simply too hot to handle and even on the rare occasions when he had to defend was he dominant. 6 &#8211; Jaco Kriel (Lions) Let&#8217;s put it this way: Not even six defenders could stop him from scoring his first try on the night. 5 &#8211; Franco Mostert (Lions) He only played 46 minutes but he was absolutely everywhere. And he even had time to steal a lineout too! 4 &#8211; RG Snyman (Bulls) Robust performance from a man who hasn&#8217;t played anywhere near his potential this season. Snyman was a massive presence on defence and was dominant in the collisions. 3 &#8211; Frans Malherbe (Stormers) He&#8217;s steadily growing in stature. The great thing about his performance in Bloem is that he didn&#8217;t concede a single penalty. That&#8217;s a triumph in itself. 2 &#8211; Malcolm Marx (Lions) This bulldozer is simply unstoppable. 1 &#8211; Thomas du Toit (Sharks) The &#8220;Tank&#8221; was the exception of a Sharks pack that was outmuscled by the Bulls. He&#8217;s a mean ball-carrier and defended like a man possessed &#8211; making three dominant tackles. Click here for the previous XV.
