The saying, if you can t beat them, join them , does apply to car manufacturers too. . Hyundai s soon-to-come i30 N reinforces that statement. It s the Korean brand s first attempt at a performance hatchback, and it sure does look aggressive. Available in two flavours, the i30 N base model churns out 184kW from a 2.0-litre turbo engine. A sprint from 0-100km/h is going to be achieved in 6.4 seconds we&#8217;ll take Hyundai s word for it, for now. If you think that power isn t enough, Hyundai has a 202kW Performance Pack i30, which lowers the 0-100km/h to 6.2 seconds before hitting a limiter at 250km/h. Torque of 352Nm remains unchanged in both flavours. . All that amount of power is accessible via a six-speed manual gearbox which, according to Hyundai, features rev-matching to ensure perfect shifts. Five selectable drive modes change the car&#8217;s temperament. Eco, Normal, Sport, and N mode alters the dampers, steering weight, and throttle responsiveness. N Custom allows you to tailor the i30 N to how you like it. Other things of note include a lower ride height than the regular i30 and a new variable valve exhaust. The exhaust can be made to sound more aggressive at the push of a button and promises WRC-inspired pops and bangs. . Talking about the interior, you will find bolstered sports seats for those in the front along with a chunky steering wheel. The Hyundai i30 N is still practical though, with three decent seats in the back and a big trunk. The centre console houses a five-inch touchscreen display as standard, but this can be increased to eight inches if you wish. . No information on pricing and local availability, but we would expect it to undercut key competitors such as the Golf GTI and Focus ST.
