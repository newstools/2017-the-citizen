Three men linked to a spate of cable theft incidents in the Free State since the beginning of the year have been arrested, Eskom said on Monday. The men, thought to be part of a group behind at least eight cases of cable theft that occurred in the towns of Kroonstad, Henneman, Allanridge and Heuningspruit between January and June 2017, were arrested after yet another cable theft incident in Kroonstad on 4 June, the power utility said. Police caught the three with a roll of overhead conductor copper cable after Eskom detected a break in energy transmission in Gunhill, a suburb of Kroonstad. Police confiscated two cell phones from the suspects and Eskom said the phone records would be used to try and trace more accomplices. We will use the cellphone records and contact lists to find the rest of the members of this group, said Tebogo Rakau, Divisional Executive for Security at Eskom. Rakau called on the public to send information they may have on the gang via SMS to Crime Line on 32211. He noted that it was an anonymous service and that the identity of those providing information remained completely protected.
