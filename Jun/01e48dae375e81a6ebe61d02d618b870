Following the sudden resignation of Eskom board chairperson Ben Ngubane, the African National Congress said on Tuesday the embattled state-owned power utility needed to clear its name of any corruption allegations, saying the former chairperson still needed to be held to account despite stepping down. On Monday evening, Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown announced that Ngubane had resigned with immediate effect. Ngubane has been implicated in the public protector s State of Capture report and in the recent leaked emails between the Guptas and their associates, indicating the extent of the family s capture of politicians, state-owned entities and their boards. If there is any wrongdoing from him or any person, whether they resign or not, they must take responsibility. Allegations of corruption and looting are quite serious, ANC national spokesperson Zizi Kodwa told EWN . He said Eskom needed stability and good corporate governance to clear the utility of allegations that it had been captured . We need good corporate governance. The utility must clean itself of corruption allegations because people are saying that our utility has been captured. ALSO READ: Ngubane still has much to answer for, says DA
