Actor Christopher Kubheka, popularly known for his character as Gunman on Yizo Yizo, has passed on. Kubheka&#8217;s body was reportedly found in his home in Soshanguve by his wife when she returned from work on Monday. &#8220;His body was discovered by his wife at their home; it&#8217;s really bad. We were told about it around 4pm, and we rushed to his home, where we saw his body. &#8220;He was such a lovely person to be around. He was very loud, but got along very well with everyone,&#8221; a neighbour reportedly told The Sowetan. Police spokesperson Captain Rheineth Motlana also confirmed Kubheka&#8217;s death to the publication, and said an inquest docket had been opened. Kubheka shot to fame with one of Mzansi&#8217;s beloved TV series, Yizo Yizo, in the late 1990s as Gunman, a troublemaker. He also acted in Zone 14 as Bazooka, showing us a different side to him as his character fell deeply in love with a girl from a well-off family. Tributes have been pouring in on Twitter, with actor Terry Pheto, who also starred in Zone 14, tweeting: &#8220;Deeply saddened by the passing of #ChrisKubheka aka Bazooka, who played my cousin in Zone14. He made so many people Happy! #RIPBazooka.&#8221; Deeply saddened by the passing of #ChrisKubheka aka Bazooka who played my cousin in Zone14.
