Handre Pollard is still considered so vital to the Springboks&#8217; cause in future that he even makes headlines in the South African A side. And the scary thing about that is he&#8217;s only playing from the bench! Also read: It s crazy to say Beast Mtawarira is past it as Springboks prop The Bulls flyhalf&#8217;s return to competitive rugby &#8211; he injured an ankle in April &#8211; had already been a talking point last week after being called up to Johan Ackermann&#8217;s side. However, the rush to press Pollard back into action has been halted by the SA A mentor&#8217;s own sense of fairness. The 23-year-old pivot will probably only play about 20 minutes in Friday&#8217;s match against the French Barbarians in Orlando. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got the freedom to decide how long Handre needs to play,&#8221; said Ackermann on Wednesday. &#8220;The whole idea from Allister (Coetzee) and SA Rugby&#8217;s is to determine where he currently stands. We want to see how sharp he is after that injury. It&#8217;s about testing him against international opposition.&#8221; However, the Lions coach feels he owes it to starting flyhalf, the Cheetahs&#8217; Fred Zeilinga, to give him decent game time. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to give Fred a fair opportunity,&#8221; said Ackermann. &#8220;He was patient when he sat on the bench last week and only played about 20 minutes. I want to reward him as he was selected initially anyway.&#8221; That said, Zeilinga isn&#8217;t really considered a contender for a Springboks jersey but Pollard is. He&#8217;ll definitely add national depth despite Elton Jantjies&#8217; excellent form. &#8220;I have to be fair to Handre too,&#8221; said Ackermann. &#8220;I can&#8217;t really see him getting more than 2o minutes. Let&#8217;s be honest. What happens if he have to use Juan de Jongh (the other backline replacement) early and also have to bring on a substitute at scrumhalf? That means Handre will then have to cover all the other backline positions should be be needed. That&#8217;s not a position you want to put him in when he&#8217;s just returned.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter. Would you like to place a rugby bet?
