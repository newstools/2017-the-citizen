Former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe intends to challenge his axing from the parastatal in the labour court. He is filing an urgent application against the legality of his removal. Molefe s stint as Eskom chief executive officially came to an end on Friday, just three weeks after he was reappointed to the post, the power utility s board confirmed. The decision came after an interministerial committee resolved to ask the Eskom board to reverse its decision to reappoint him. Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown, in her role as government shareholder of Eskom, then directed the board to rescind their decision. Molefe had stepped down in November after being implicated in the State of Capture report. He subsequently expected a R30 million pension payout that Brown denied to him, and he then returned as the CEO, claiming he&#8217;d been on unpaid leave the entire team, even while being sworn in as an ANC MP.
