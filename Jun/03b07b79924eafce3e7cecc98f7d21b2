A man was killed when he was hit by a car on the N2 northbound in the Chesterville area in Durban on Sunday, paramedics said. ER24 paramedics arrived on the scene to find the car in the fast lane of the highway. The pedestrian, a man, was found lying on top of the car, ER24 spokesman Russel Meiring said. Paramedics assessed the man and found that he had sustained numerous injuries and showed no signs of life. Unfortunately, nothing could be done for the man and he was declared dead. The driver of the car, a woman, was found to have sustained moderate injuries. She was treated and thereafter transported to a nearby hospital for further treatment.
