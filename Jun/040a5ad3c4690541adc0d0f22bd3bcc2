The Proteas&#8217; continued presence in the ICC Champions Trophy is dependent on a positive result against India in London on Sunday. This week&#8217;s unexpected loss to Pakistan has made their passage to the semifinals far more difficult.

Is Sunday&#8217;s game a straight knock-out game? Yes. It&#8217;s a virtual quarterfinal. Whoever wins, goes through. Is AB de Villiers &#8211; who had a hamstring niggle &#8211; fit to play and how does he feel about his iffy form? South Africa&#8217;s skipper is indeed fit as a fiddle. &#8220;I am, yes,&#8221; he said on Saturday. And he was equally emphatic over his lack of runs. &#8220;Look, I&#8217;m still in good form. Still hitting the ball well, as always. It&#8217;s just a matter of going out there and doing it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There&#8217;s nothing I can say here that&#8217;s going to change anything except for that I still believe I can and hopefully I&#8217;ll prove that. But I&#8217;m very excited with this opportunity for the team and for myself.&#8221; De Villiers has been criticised for his captaincy on this England tour to date. How is that playing on his mind? He seems pretty cool about it. &#8220;I think my captaincy is pretty good. I&#8217;ve thoroughly enjoyed every second out there. Lost the last game, so that&#8217;s never ideal for a captain. I understand what I&#8217;m trying to do out there. I&#8217;m really enjoying the captaincy. I think I make some good calls,&#8221; he said. However, De Villiers is still rather edgy in his dealings with the media. &#8220;Yeah, pencil&#8217;s in your hand, and I unfortunately can&#8217;t control what you&#8217;re going to write but in my mind I&#8217;m a good captain.&#8221; Will the Proteas change their line-up for this crucial clash? Some will say Wayne Parnell didn&#8217;t cover himself in glory against Pakistan. He made a first-ball duck and generally bowled poorly. The most likely candidate to come in is Andile Phehlukwayo but against a powerful batting order like India, Parnell&#8217;s superior bowling firepower is probably still more attractive. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have a look at the wicket. The temptation is always there. I mean, there are 15 world-class players on the side, so we&#8217;ll have a look at whatever is the best possible 11,&#8221; said De Villiers.
