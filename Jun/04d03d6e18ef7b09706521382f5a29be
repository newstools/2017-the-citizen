Three Jeju United players from Korea were suspended for up to six months on Friday after an AFC Champions League knock-out game against Urawa Red Diamonds descended into violence. Cho Yong-Hyung was banned for six months and fined $20,000 for pushing the referee after he was sent off in the last-16 game on May 31, which ended in a mass brawl. Unused substitute Baek Dong-Gyu was banned for three months after he leapt off the bench and elbowed Urawa captain Yuki Abe in the face. Kweon Han-Jin was also suspended for two games and fined $1,000 for hitting an opponent in the face, the Asian Football Confederation&#8217;s disciplinary body announced. The match finished with ugly scenes as melees broke out around the pitch and Jeju players chased a rival from Urawa into the tunnel. Japan&#8217;s Urawa had come from 2-0 down in the first leg to win the return fixture 3-0, scoring the crucial goal in extra time to edge out their Korean rivals. Jeju United were fined $40,000 and Urawa Red Diamonds were slapped with a $20,000 as their officials were involved in the brawl. &nbsp; AFC said it has a &#8220;zero tolerance policy on abuse towards match officials&#8221;.
