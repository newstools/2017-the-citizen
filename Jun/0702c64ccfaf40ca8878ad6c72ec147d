The decision follows the registrar receiving concerning information about the operations of JVN between March and June 2017, Financial Services Board (FSB) spokeswoman Tembisa Marele said. After the registrar instructed an inspection into the affairs of JVN, the FSB obtained a search and seizure warrant that was executed on June 20 at JVN s offices in Johannesburg. The sole director, chief executive officer, and shareholder of JVN Levi Alex Nkosi and the chief operations officer Morrison Kwarayi were appointed as representatives of JVN, and were only authorised to operate under the supervision of the key individual David Lamb. At this stage it appeared that the key individual had neither exercised the required management and oversight over the activities of JVN nor the required supervision over the CEO or COO. For all intents and purposes it appeared that Nkosi was in control of all operations. The inspection into the affairs of JVN was continuing on an urgent basis. The FSB was working with the relevant law enforcement agencies to take the matter forward. The FSB will not tolerate unlawful activities by its licence holders. The public is once again warned to be careful when offered investment products with unrealistic and guaranteed returns, vague financial products, products that are not explained properly or in detail. If investors are still unsure, they should rather contact the FSB to verify whether the offered products qualify as recognised financial products and furthermore are offered by registered product providers, Marele said.
