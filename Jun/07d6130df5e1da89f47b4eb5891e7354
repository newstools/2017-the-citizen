The Provincial Tourism Technical Committee was established in North West to enhance intergovernmental relations and strengthen the public private partnerships in the tourism fraternity, the provincial tourism department said on Monday. The committee was responsible for identifying strategic priorities and ensuring that there was an alignment between the tourism related objectives of the committee with those of various other local partners and other key stakeholders. The participation of all spheres of government in this forum is vital as it will ensure that there is inclusive coordinated planning and all parties will get to practically input their expressions so as to emerge with quality resolutions which will then ensure that there is proper planning going forward, chief director for tourism planning, policy and research Ishmael Kgokong said. He said that the re-establishment of such a structure was vital for sustainable growth of the tourism sector. He added that the committee will also seek to address and mend the past plenary mishaps whereby government seemed to have been planning alone without the involvement of industry role players and relevant key stakeholders.
