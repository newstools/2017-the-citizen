The National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) on Monday announced that a man had died after getting into difficulty on the beach in Witsand along the Cape&#8217;s south coast. According to a statement, the NSRI Witsand duty crew were activated at about 11.35am on Sunday following reports of a man collapsed unconscious on a beach East of Die Blokke. An NSRI sea rescue vehicle and NSRI medics responded, while the Western Cape government health EMS were also activated. Theo Erasmus, NSRI Witsand station commander, said: On arrival on the scene, we found a local man who is well-known to the community, 56-year-old Koos Erasmus, had suffered a suspected heart attack on the beach and our NSRI medics initiated CPR [Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation] efforts, and he was brought to the parking area at Main Beach, where we were met by EMS paramedics, but after extensive resuscitation efforts were exhausted, he was sadly declared deceased by paramedics.
