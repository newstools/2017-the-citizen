Wits University has announced that former finance minister Nhlanhla Nene will lead its Business School from Monday until a new head is appointed next year. The university said once the new head was appointed Nene would continue to serve as an honorary professor and a scholar in residence at the WBS. Nene s appointment follows the resignation of the WBS head earlier this year. It gives me great pleasure to join the WBS that will enable me to share my knowledge, experience and networks in order to empower and work with young, talented individuals, academics and business leaders, said Nene. He was booted from cabinet in one of President Jacob Zuma s controversial late-night reshuffles back in 2015. Defending his reshuffle, Zuma had said Nene would be nominated to head the African region of the New Development Bank (Brics bank). Nene told eNCA last year that he has not heard anything from the bank since his removal. Wits vice-chancellor Professor Adam Habib said the university was honoured to have Nene in one of its leadership positions. His political credence, business acumen and remarkable intellect places him in good stead to lead the WBS as the search for a permanent head commences, he said. Habib said Nene s leadership, advice and insight would add value to the school s quality of courses, debates and research. Nene also serves as a non-executive director at Allan Gray and is a resident adviser at Thebe Investment Corporation.
