The Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Municipality has announced its 2017 top 50 business award winners. The 2017 award ceremony was hosted by Executive Mayor Athol Trollip at the Boardwalk Conference Centre on Tuesday. Some of the winners include Algoa Bus, Eyethu Fishing, Innowind and VWSA. Trollip said companies from all sectors were recognised for their role in developing the economy, creating jobs and promoting investment. This initiative forms part of a Trade and Investment Strategy to retain and recognise investors, past and present. Trollip said the metro was well-positioned as an international investment destination of choice and should thus capitalise on its niche offerings. The metro is a major roleplayer in agriculture and ocean economy, as well as other key economic areas. We therefore need to capitalise on our strengths and develop the economy of our city to become competitive with others such as Cape Town, said Trollip. As such, the continued recognition of the contribution you make in our City is acknowledged, highly appreciated and celebrated . In recent years, some of the Nelson Mandela Bay s local companies, big and small, have shown confidence in doing business in the region. This has translated to new investments in the manufacturing industry and considerable expansions or reinvestments have materialised.
