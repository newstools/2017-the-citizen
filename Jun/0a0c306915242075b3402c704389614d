According to the US&#8217;s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, distracted driving caused 3,477 road deaths in 2015, so any app that can help keep drivers eyes on the road instead of on the screen is a welcome feature. . In case you find it hard to let go of your phone while driving, Apple wants to help curb your addiction with a new feature bearing the incredibly awkward name, Do Not Disturb While Driving . Announced at Apple s Worldwide Developers Conference, Do Not Disturb While Driving (DNDWD) will launch this fall as part of iOS 11 for the iPhone and iPad. The mode activates when the phone detects that its owner is in a car and is not using Apple CarPlay and will mute any incoming notifications. It can even send automated text message replies explaining that the phone s user is driving. According to Engadget, DNDWD uses information about Bluetooth connectivity and nearby Wi-Fi networks to determine whether the phone is in a moving car. The feature will be automatically enabled whenever the phone is in a moving car, though passengers or drivers with a blatant disregard for safety can manually override it. iOS 11 will launch as a free update this fall for the iPhone 5s and newer.
