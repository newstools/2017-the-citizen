Former ANC MP Vytjie Mentor has opened a file on Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba&#8217;s alleged affair with a married woman. Judy, short for Judith, from Johannesburg, joined parliament mid-term during Mentor&#8217;s parliament days and was made to sit next to Mentor in the chamber. Sitting on the other side of Mentor was a &#8220;corrupt&#8221; Chinese man who had allegedly funded ANC T-shirts and was President Jacob Zuma&#8217;s business partner. &#8220;This lady very soon dated Malusi Gigaba, and much later dated [Michael] Masutha as well, this even though she was married,&#8221; Mentor alleges. Before the term ended she had allegedly flown to the now-famous Dubai and used to boast about her three bank accounts. Like Gigaba&#8217;s other ex-girlfriend Buhle Mkhize, Judy apparently was a lavish spender and had a wardrobe most women only wished they could have. &#8220;She even had a nerve to visit me when I lain in hospital with my multi-splintered bones, nerves and arteries. The puzzle pieces are coming together now,&#8221; she added. Read her full post below: The woman is apparently now &#8220;very close&#8221; to Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Des Van Rooyen too. Gigaba recently made headlines after his former nyatsi Mkhize shared details on Twitter about their relationship, further slamming his wife, Norma Gigaba. In a series of tweets, she detailed trips from Durban in a private jet and ended with a warning to Norma to never talk about their affair to avoid more files being opened.
