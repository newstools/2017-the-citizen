The African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) welcomed the ruling by the High Court in Johannesburg on Wednesday, regarding the non-discrimination of faiths and clarity regarding school governing body s role. The ACDP is delighted that the court did not halt the teaching of the Bible in schools. The court clearly stated that when the teaching of Scripture is taught in schools, it should not discriminate against those who are not religious, or those who practice other faiths, ACDP leader Reverend Kenneth Meshoe said. Last month an application by Organisation for Religious Education and Democracy (OGOD) was brought to the High Court requesting them to ban religious practices at schools, which they felt ran counter to the conviction of 95 percent of South Africans who identify themselves with a religion. During proceedings, Judge Willem Van Der Linde said that the Constitution supported both parties in the case, in that everyone had the right to religion, they could practice in public and attendance was free and voluntary. Meshoe said the ACDP welcomed the ruling confirming religious observances could be conducted at state or state aided institutions We further welcome the ruling that empowers school governing bodies to make their own rules pertaining to the teaching of religion in public schools, he said. During an interview outside the court room, Meshoe said it was good news that the authority and rights of parents to determine policies in their schools was upheld by the court. We also welcome the ruling that when the teaching of religious observations take place, people of other religions should not be discriminated against. The ACDP said they were studying the full judgment and consulting regarding any implications for people of faith and schools resulting from the judgement. We will comment further in due course.
