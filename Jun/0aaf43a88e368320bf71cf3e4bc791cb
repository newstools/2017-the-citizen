Two ladies of the night in Pretoria not only took their client for the proverbial ride, they literally drove off into the sunset with all his personal belongings and his girlfriend s Toyota Yaris worth R180 000. Police spokesperson Captain Daniel Mavimbela said a 28-year-old man allegedly picked the ladies up on Friday night at about 4pm on the corner of Hamilton and Stanza Bopape in Pretoria. He reportedly parked at a food outlet nearby where he consumed alcohol, in the company of his unknown new friend. From that point the man passed out and woke up later that same day in an unknown location in Mamelodi, east of Pretoria, Mavimbela said. He said the man reported that the car and all his personal belongings were missing. The women had also disappeared. The car belongs to the victim&#8217;s girlfriend and it was bought for her by her father, Mavimbela said. According to the police, it emerged that the victim had had his VW Polo stolen in 2015 under similar circumstances. In this case he had also picked up two sex workers in Pretoria Central. They allegedly ended up driving off with his car shortly after he felt dizzy and stopped on the side of the road and alighted from the car. One of the ladies jumped into the driver s seat and drove off, leaving the victim to lick his wounds. The victim believes that he was spiked on both occasions, Mavimbela said. Police are investigating both cases.
