The EFF on Sunday accused the Gupta family of spying on Julius Malema, saying this had been going on for some time. Sunday reports accusing the family of spying on business rivals did not come as a surprise for the EFF as it had &#8220;always known this and now the leaked emails have confirmed with evidence&#8221;. The party alleged that the Guptas have had access to the travel itineraries and ID numbers of every MP, further revealing why they had such information at their disposal, especially with regards to Malema. &#8220;We cannot think of any other reason why they would spy on him, except with the hope to find him isolated and take his life.&#8221; Not so long ago, the party tracked a car that was following Malema around, it further said. This even though the EFF had never publicised most of its leaders&#8217; trips. &#8220;We also know that it is impossible for the Guptas, on their own, to attain this information without the help of both Home Affairs and State Security. Thus, beyond the Guptas it is the state that is actually spying on the CIC. &#8220;We know that they also illegally monitor his calls and have been doing so for some time.&#8221; The party said it would take the evidence found in the leaked emails to the Inspector General of Intelligence for investigation, further warning the Guptas against thinking they would be &#8220;allowed the leverage over our leader&#8217;s life&#8221;. &#8220;They have no right whatsoever to spy on the EFF leadership and they must know that as EFF we are not scared of them. &#8220;If they want our leader, we shall meet them toe to toe right at their doorstep and give them whatever it is they are looking for.&#8221; The party said it would defend its leaders &#8220;with whatever revolutionary means possible&#8221; if authorities failed to address this issue.
