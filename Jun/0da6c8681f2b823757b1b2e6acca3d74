ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe has been highly criticised after making a statement that left social media users saying he was rude and should apologise. During his speech at the ANC Gauteng provincial policy conference on Friday, in isiXhosa, Mantashe referred to the 94 mentally ill patients who died after they were moved from Life Esidimeni Health Care Centre as &#8220;mageza&#8221;. Though the word does describe a mentally ill person, some on Twitter said it was an offensive word and his tone was &#8220;insensitive&#8221;. Even former Radio 702 presenter Redi Tlhabi took to Twitter to ask if Mantashe was right in using the word. &#8220;Xhosa-speaking SAfricans, I&#8217;ve only ever heard &#8216;Ligeza&#8217; spoken negatively. Can it also be literal term to refer to mentally ill patients?&#8221; she asked. Responding to her question, most said the word existed but was not appropriate. Some said he was referring to the more than 200 ANC MPs in the National Assembly. These were some of the reactions on Twitter: &#8220;That was totally wrong, Mantashe was making fun about the death of mentally ill patients killed by ANC government.&#8221; &#8220;Xhosa language also respects the dead, the tone was not respectful, ndingumxhosa by the way, asithi &#8216;lifile elageza&#8217; xa kubhubhe umntu.&#8221; &#8220;Abantu abakhubazeke ngokusengqondweni,&#8217; would have been a better term, less offensive. Don&#8217;t use our languages to justify ubukrwada!&#8221; &#8220;It&#8217;s nothing wrong because it&#8217;s not your family member.&#8221; &#8220;This is simply despicable! Ukrwada uMantashe. Someone should take him to the Human Rights Commission!&#8221; &#8220;It also doesn&#8217;t mean that those who are psychotic should be disrespected by being called amageza.&#8221; There were a few who defended Mantashe, saying there was no other word he could have used in his address. They further said he did not use it offensively, but only &#8220;meant&#8221;. But even those could not win against a mob that called for Mantashe to apologise. &#8220;No guys, even if he meant well but the way he delivered those words is very insensitive and wrong. Bra Gwede must apologize, he knows better,&#8221; one said. What are your thoughts on Mantashe&#8217;s use of the word?
