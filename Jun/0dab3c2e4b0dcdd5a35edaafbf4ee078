Two years after the Guptas made headlines for flying more than a 100 guests from India to Waterkloof base for the wedding of Vega Gupta and her husband, Aakash Jahajgarhia, email evidence has exposed how in 2015, they were allowed to use the military base again. According to Sunday Times, the Guptas&#8217; aircraft, ZS-OAK, was allowed to depart from Waterkloof for Sishen, in the Northern Cape. An email from Ashu Chawla chief executive of Sahara Computer, shows that this occurred. Defence department spokesperson Siphiwe Dlamini confirmed to Sunday Times that the Gupta plane was authorised to use Waterkloof for &#8220;military and civilian dignitaries to the South African Army Combat Training Centre in Lohatla Northern Cape&#8221;. &#8220;These dignitaries and captains of the defence industry were invited to attend the 2015 edition of &#8216;Exercise Amani Africa&#8217; a force preparation exercise with various regional militaries,&#8221; said Dlamini. Last week 2 000 emails were leaked to major Sunday newspapers. The correspondence appears to back evidence that the Gupta brothers, Atul, Ajay and Tony have influence over Cabinet ministers, at times approving the appointment of some, including Mosebenzi Zwane to the portfolio of mineral resources. The powerful family are said to have circulated emails to high-level officials in the United Arab Emirates, requesting second residency for President Jacob Zuma and his family. It has also been revealed how the Guptas assisted Duduzane Zuma in purchasing an R18-million apartment at one of the tallest skyscrapers in Dubai.
