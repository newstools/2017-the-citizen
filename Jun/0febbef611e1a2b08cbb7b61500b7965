The Hawks arrested two men for allegedly manufacturing drugs after they were found in possession of crystal meth valued at R6 million at a drug manufacturing in Randburg. Hawks spokesperson captain Ndivhuo Mulamu said on Thursday the duo was arrested on Wednesday night at Watercome Farm. The arrests came as a result of a joint intelligence-driven operation aimed at thwarting drug-dealing syndicates. Chemicals and equipment used to manufacture drugs as well as 20kg of crystal methamphetamine with an estimated value of R6 million were seized, he said. The men, both aged 49, will appear in the Randburg Magistrates Court on Monday. African News Agency (ANA)
