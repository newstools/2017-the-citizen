A man, believed to be in his 40s, was critically injured when his leg got caught in a harvester on a farm in Delmas in Mupumalanga, paramedics said on Saturday. ER24 paramedics were called to the Delmas Clinic for further medical assistance after the accident on Friday, ER24 spokesman Russel Meiring said. Upon arrival, paramedics found that the man had sustained a serious injury to his leg and was in a critical condition. The man was treated and provided with advanced life support interventions. Once treated, the man was transported to Life Glynwood [Hospital] for urgent treatment. It was understood that the man had apparently been cleaning the harvester when his leg got caught. His colleagues managed to free him and rush him to the nearby clinic. An investigation would be launched into the accident, Meiring said.
