PAC secretary-general Narius Moloto has been suspended and is facing disciplinary action and possible charges of financial misrepresentation, according to PAC president Luthando Mbinda. Mbinda informed all party structures by letter on June 25 of the suspension. It was leaked to the media this week. In it Mbinda said a PAC national executive committee (NEC) resolution was taken to suspend Moloto on June 11 and it was ratified on June 25. The NEC appointed Katiya Gcobani as acting secretary-general last Sunday, he added. Mbinda told The Citizen that Moloto was suspended after he allegedly disbanded the Tshwane regional executive committee, the Limpopo provincial executive committee and the executive of the Azanian People s Liberation Army Military Veterans Association in Ekurhuleni. He also apparently interfered in the affairs of the Pan Africanist Students Movement of Azania. Mbinda said the party would also press criminal charges against Moloto for his alleged misrepresentation of PAC financial reports to parliament which led to the PAC not receiving funding from the National Assembly. He also allegedly wrote to parliament asking it to remove Mbinda, claiming he was no longer the party president. But Moloto hit back. He said Mbinda was no longer the president as the NEC had expelled him. I am not suspended. Mbinda was expelled from the party on June 14. Moloto told party structures in a letter on June 29 that the NEC booted out Mbinda with effect from June 14 after he failed to appear before the party s disciplinary committee to answer to charges of serious misconduct against him.
