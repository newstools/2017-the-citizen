Former SABC chief operating officer Hlaudi Motsoeneng has been reportedly found guilty by an internal disciplinary hearing, News24 reports. The ruling by the chairperson of the disciplinary hearing, Advocate Nazeer Cassim, was confirmed to the news website by a reliable source close to the hearing. Motsoeneng faced charges of bringing the SABC into disrepute and causing irreparable damage to his employer. This followed his controversial four-hour long press conference on April 19 in Johannesburg, which allegedly contrived the terms of his suspension. During the presser, Motsoeneng defended his 90% local music content quota, and criticised parliament s ad-hoc committee that was tasked with investigating the affairs of the beleaguered broadcaster. Motsoeneng also slammed interim board member Krish Naidoo. According to the report, Cassim said the report into the internal disciplinary hearing was released early on Monday. The SABC is expected to make the announcement at a press briefing later today at 3pm. ALSO READ: SABC shuts down TNA Business Breakfast shows
