Presenter and model Minnie Dlamini has opened up about her past relationship with Bafana Bafana goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune, marriage and the crush that rapper Cassper Nyovest has on her. In an interview with DJ Fresh and Somizi on Metro FM on Friday morning, Minnie said she used to tell her fianc Quinton Jones before their engagement that they should not get married but stay together and call each other &#8220;life partners&#8221;. The idea of getting married was &#8220;too sensantionalised&#8221; for her and she was just &#8220;over it&#8221;. &#8220;I was over the fairy tale, I just wanted to be loved and love. But I knew that if I was ever going to get married, it would be with him,&#8221; she said. However, all that changed when she got engaged to her boyfriend last year in December, news that broke Cassper&#8217;s heart terribly. Minnie further told DJ Fresh she found the crush Cassper had on her &#8220;funny and sweet and cute&#8221;. &#8220;I mean, he&#8217;s still really respectful. He sent a message and said congratulations. He actually apologised for the rant because he did not expect it to get that viral. He was just being silly on Twitter. We actually have a very good friendship, he&#8217;s very cool. We like to make fun of it and he&#8217;s always like: &#8216;But you don&#8217;t realise how serious I am.'&#8221; Minnie&#8217;s attitude towards marriage may have been influenced by her past relationships, she said, further addressing rumours Khune had paid R1 million in lobola for her. &#8220;I was never ever lobolaed by a soccer player; the first time it happened was now and I&#8217;m getting married now,&#8221; she said. Though after their much-publicised break-up Minnie said Khune had broken her heart, she said there was nothing she could have done differently. &#8220;I just wish I woke up sooner, that&#8217;s all. Not in a bad way,&#8221; she said. Minnie went on to talk about her family&#8217;s cultural traditions, explaining where she stands with her relationship with her ancestors. &#8220;I&#8217;m very Zulu, so I&#8217;m at the point where I pray to God and I say thank you God but how I look at it and how it was taught to me growing up is, my parents said in the Bible there is your guardian angel. Your guardian angel is not archangel Michael and Gabriel, but ogogo (ancestors). That&#8217;s how we were raised. &#8220;We do give thanks, we do slaughter. When something good happens we burn impepho, so we are a very cultural family and being strong in my culture and not being afraid to show it, even though I am a public figure, has been really important to me. &#8220;I&#8217;m not less sophisticated because I do a cultural ceremony, I&#8217;m richer,&#8221; she said.
