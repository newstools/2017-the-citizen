Free State Premier Ace Magashule on Thursday said he didn t hold any grudges against Fikile Mbalula after the ANC national executive committee member accused him of being capable of destroying the governing party. His spokesperson Thabo Mmeko told EWN the premier who s also the chairperson of the ANC in the province couldn t understand why Mbalula made such comments on Twitter earlier on Thursday, after saying Magashule s nomination as the party s next secretary-general by the ANC Youth League (ANCYL) on Tuesday was a definite no. Mbalula has instead backed Gauteng Premier David Makhura for the top job after tweeting that he was a good leader, hardworking and honest. Mmeko said even though Magashule didn t take kindly to Mbalula s statements about him, he doesn t t hold any grudges. The chair continues to have good relations with Mbalula as a product of this province, Mmeko said. Meanwhile, the ANCYL said the police minister should have raised his concerns about the premier with the party s leadership. He should know better that doing what he did does not help the situation, ANCYL spokesperson Mlondi Mkhize said. The ANC in the Free State said Magashule had a good track record and they were right behind him, according to EWN.
