Eskom has synchronised Unit 4 of the Medupi Power Station Project in Lephalale, Limpopo, to the national power grid, becoming the third of the power station s six units to come on stream. The synchronisation of Unit 4, which happened on Wednesday, also marks a key milestone towards the full commercial operation of the unit ahead of its scheduled commercial operation in 2018. Synchronisation is when the generator in the unit is connected into the power grid so that it is aligned with all other generators on the national grid. It will then start to generate and deliver electricity into the grid. Acting group executive for Group Capital, Prish Govender, said this was a great milestone for Eskom. Medupi Unit 4 synchronisation is a great milestone and a strong indication that we are on the right path on delivering the entire New Build programme to the country ahead of schedule. I am thrilled by this achievement, Govender said. This achievement makes us all proud and we commend the team for their commitment in working tirelessly to ensure that Unit 4 synchronisation is achieved ahead of schedule. Once completed, Medupi will be the fourth largest coal-fired power plant, and the largest dry-cooled power station in the world. It will consist of six units with an installed capacity of 4,800MW. The planned operational life of the power station is 50 years. African News Agency (ANA) For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
