A young Rustenburg entrepreneur, Terry Bogopane jets out for the United States of America on Thursday to participate in the in the 2017 Mandela Washington Fellowship for Young African Leaders Initiative. Bogopane, 35, from Phokeng near Rustenburg is the managing director of Kgokagano Media, said he was happy to participate in the program and hope to hone his leadership skills with other 999 young leaders selected amongst 63,000 applicants of the sub-Saharan Africa. The program will run for six weeks starting on June 15 until August 3. The Mandela Washington Fellowship (MWF) for Young African Leaders Initiative is a flagship program of the US government that began in 2014 to empower young African leaders through academic coursework, leadership training, and networking and has a network of nearly 3000 fellows from 49 Sub-Saharan African countries. Bogopane has taken an active role in contributing to the desired goal of a better South Africa as an active participant in civil society and through entrepreneurship. He founded the African Youth Entrepreneurs Network (AYEN), a platform that serves as a link between young entrepreneurs in the rural areas and networking opportunities, information, and access to mentorship. AYEN was founded on the heels of the discovery that most entrepreneurs in the grassroots do not get the same exposure to opportunities and information compared to their counterparts who are urban dwellers, we provide the succour for this by bringing these opportunities to their doorstep, he said. With AYEN, young entrepreneurs can share ideas and network with each other, they also get to access on the first-hand basis, how to run a successful business enterprise, the best practices they can use on their way to the top.
