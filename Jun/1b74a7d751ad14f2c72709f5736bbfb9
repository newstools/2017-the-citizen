Tabloid Sunday Sun has revealed that actor Bonginkosi &#8220;Zola&#8221; Dlamini&#8217;s wife allegedly claims to have been physically and emotionally abused by the star and has opened a police case against him. The couple are now reportedly estranged and Sibongile Nkabinde no longer lives at his Soweto home with his grandmother and two children. The paper&#8217;s source alleges the couple argued about Zola allegedly sending his &#8220;girlfriends&#8221; to pick up their children from school. The Moroka police have confirmed a case was opened against Zola, though did not divulge any details. The tabloid claims to have seen WhatsApp messages in which Nkabinde goes as far as to express an intention to buy a firearm after alleged threats from Zola. The actor was reportedly angry when called by the paper for comment, and said he could send whoever he wanted to fetch his kids from school, though he would not confirm if he had indeed sent any girlfriends on such errands. Nkabinde&#8217;s mother told the paper she never wanted to hear Zola&#8217;s name again. She was quoted as saying: &#8220;That boy has disrespected us for too long.&#8221; A second source the paper spoke to reportedly said Nkabinde had felt she had no choice but to lay the charges against her husband because Zola had &#8220;strangled her&#8221; after their argument allegedly became violent at the start of the month.
