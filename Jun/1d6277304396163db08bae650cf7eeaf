When the world tried to pick you apart Never broke character never had a difference of heart Never got credit never wanted any A hero without a ego I heard the aren&#8217;t any My best friend lost his dad at a young age That became a lesson for the both of us at some stage Cause he would always tell me that he had no one he could run to Meanwhile I was just angry that you couldn&#8217;t buy me some shoe I&#8217;m guessing this is what it&#8217;s come to We judge our fathers by how rich they are Which Is the least important thing on the list , there&#8217;s love There&#8217;s self confidence , humility You taught the love of God , the Holy trinity Too much pressure on the male figure You ain&#8217;t providing then you worthless The world seems to turn a blind eye when we hurt men Some niggas can&#8217;t express themselves to women so they hurt them It&#8217;s just a vicious circle , we really need the Bible Thank you for teaching to believe in the word Thank you for teaching to never hit a girl dad Thank you for teaching to take over the world dad Thank you for teaching to cry when I hurt dad Thank you for teaching to take over the world dad Letaima i wrote this song to tell you that I love you I hope you know there&#8217;s nobody that I would put above you You are God , you my father , you&#8217;re my brother and my uncle Le Taima I wrote this song to tell you that I love you YOU ARE SUPERMAN!!!
