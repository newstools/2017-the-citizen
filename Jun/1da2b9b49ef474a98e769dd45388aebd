Dam levels in the Western Cape have seen a slight increase, Western Cape environmental affairs and development planning MEC Anton Bredell said on Monday. Dam levels have increased to 22.8%, which is still far off the dam levels of 35.4% this time last year. Bredell said the levels of the province s major dams were still below 20%, which was cause for concern. He urged people to continue with their water saving efforts. Theewaterskloof is at 18.6%, Clanwilliam dam at 16.3% and Vo lvlei dam at 19.3%. We urge the public to continue to conserve water as much as possible. Bredell s department said water saving would be top of the agenda when the province s premier, MECs and mayors meet in Worcester tomorrow. Declarations relating to water will be signed by key role-players within municipalities, the agriculture sector and the economic sector. The main aim of these Declarations is to unite the Whole of Society s commitment to accelerate action towards responsible and sustainable water use in the Western Cape.
