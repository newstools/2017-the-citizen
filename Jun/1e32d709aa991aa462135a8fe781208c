Some Tshwane University of Technology (TUT) students affected by the taxi strike will not make it to their exam venues on Thursday morning. The university has, however, said students who cannot make it to examination venues in time will not be disadvantaged. TUT spokesperson Willa de Ruyter said the university was monitoring the taxi strike in Tshwane closely. &#8220;We have been informed that the Tshwane Metro Police Department [TMPD] is in the process of clearing blocked roads. &#8220;Students who are affected and cannot get to exam venues will not be disadvantaged by the strike, and should contact their lecturer or the head of their respective departments. Those who are already at exam and test venues will continue to write as scheduled,&#8221; De Ruyter said
