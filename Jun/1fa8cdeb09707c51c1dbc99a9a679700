Bonang Matheba, who turned 30 last week, is planning to throw perhaps one of the biggest birthday celebrations Mzansi will ever witness. Bonang said it was time women celebrated their achievements big or small and somehow, it seems they were still afraid to do so. &#8220;It&#8217;s like we&#8217;re not allowed to. We always talk about ubuntu, and as soon as you do it, it is said: &#8216;Ohhh, she&#8217;s full of herself.&#8217; Humility is good, but it&#8217;s got the other side that doesn&#8217;t allow you to celebrate yourself,&#8221; she told Sowetan Magazine. Bonang will celebrate her achievements in a R500 000 pink-themed party, with only 200 people on the guest list. Guests will go home with gifts, including her book. &#8220;It is a very big ball-gala-gown dinner. I mean, I&#8217;ve saved for over two-and-a-half years, so the budget is crazy it&#8217;s like a wedding,&#8221; she told the magazine. The celebration will include live performances, a stage production, ballerinas in tutus and a flower wall. Her cake will be suspended from the ceiling. Unfortunately, the party will operate under a media blackout. Bonang further told the magazine she was ready for marriage. &#8220;I think marriage, for me, has always been finding and marrying your best friend. It&#8217;s about being at a time and space in your life where you are ready to settle down, and it can happen whenever,&#8221; she said. She believes she has found &#8220;the one&#8221; in boyfriend AKA, who she said was her biggest fan, partner in crime and and BFF. &#8220;I mean I&#8217;m good now, I&#8217;m content, so I can get married,&#8221; she added.
