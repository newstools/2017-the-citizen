Zimbabwean courts have freed 51 residents arrested during anti-government protests that shook the beleaguered country last year. In a spectacular collapse of the state s case against the residents from the capital Harare, magistrate Lanzini Ncube indicated the prosecution failed during trial to prove the essential elements of the charges of public violence. The magistrate also ruled there was no positive identification for three accused residents who were named by witnesses during trial. Regarding the rest of the accused named by the witnesses that were police, Ncube ruled no link was established among them and the charge of committing public violence. Police arrested the residents in the high-density suburb of Mabvuku last July and charged them under the draconian Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act. During trial, prosecutors charged the residents also committed public violence when they staged a protest to demonstrate against alleged police corruption and the $200 (R2 600) fine regime gazetted through cumbersome traffic regulations. It was further alleged they had demanded the resignation of President Mugabe. Last year, the veteran leader (now 93) and his Zanu-PF party faced unprecedented countrywide protests over the economic meltdown and political problems. Police, accused of partisanship and propping the ruling party stranglehold on power, responded brutally to demonstrators and arrested many (ANA-CAJ) For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
