Us sports fans rather enjoy the odd instance of a streaker running onto the field. It&#8217;s entertaining to see them throw a sidestep or two and embarrass security officials. Last weekend&#8217;s first Test between the All Blacks and the British &amp; Irish Lions also concluded with a, uhm, &#8220;showstopper&#8221; of this kind. However, what makes this effort unique is that we are given a glimpse into what actually happens beforehand. It&#8217;s entertaining to say the least!
