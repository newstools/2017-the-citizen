A mother was killed after her house caught fire in Lewis Byron Road in Malvern, Durban, Rescue Care paramedics said in a statement. Rescue Care spokesperson Ceron Lennox said the incident happened on Wednesday evening. Her children luckily escaped the fire which ripped through their house. Lennox said the house was on fire when paramedics arrived on the scene along with the Durban Fire Department. Durban Fire Department worked to extinguish the blaze whilst paramedics assessed two children aged two and ten years old. Once the fire was extinguished the fire department entered the building and found a lady believed to be in her thirties had sustained severe burns and there was nothing more paramedics could do and she was declared deceased on the scene. The two children had managed to escape injury and were cared for by the neighbour. The cause of the fire remains unknown, but SAPS and the Durban Fire Department are investigating.
