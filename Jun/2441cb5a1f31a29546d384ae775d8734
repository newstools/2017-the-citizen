Cricket South Africa (CSA) on Monday unveiled the eight franchise owners for the governing body&#8217;s new T20 Global League. The tournament, which CSA hopes will become as commercially viable as other competitions such as the Indian Premier League (IPL) and Australia&#8217;s Big Bash, will commence it&#8217;s inaugural edition in November. The franchises will be based in eight cities. DURBAN Owner: Fawad Rana, Managing Director of Qatar Lubricants. (Rana also owns the Pakistan franchise Lahore Qalanders) Marquee Proteas player: Hashim Amla Ground: Kingsmead Why the owner chose Durban: &#8220;I come from Lahore, it&#8217;s a very passionate city and it&#8217;s very welcoming. I live in Doha, a port city that&#8217;s also very welcoming. I believe Durban has the best of both those cities.&#8221; BENONI Owner: Javed Afridi, Chief Executive of Haier Pakistan (a multinational electronics company) Marquee Proteas player: Quinton de Kock Ground: Willowmoore Park Why the owner chose Benoni: &#8220;Benoni is a city of youth. When we bought Peshawar Zalmi in Pakistan, it was about youth.&#8221; PRETORIA Owner: Osman Osman, Managing Director at BluBlood (a local promotions and talent buying company) Marquee Proteas player: AB de Villiers Ground: SuperSport Park, Centurion Why the owner chose Pretoria: &#8220;That&#8217;s where we actually live.

Why the owner chose Cape Town: &#8220;It&#8217;s a beautiful country with beautiful people. We&#8217;re looking forward to making Cape Town our home away from home.&#8221; BLOEMFONTEIN Owner: Sushil Kumar, Owner of City Sports (Hong Kong) Marquee Proteas player: David Miller Ground: Mangaung Oval Why the owner chose Bloemfontein: &#8220;It&#8217;s a cultural experience. We&#8217;re keen to learn much about the city.&#8221; JOHANNESBURG Owner: GMR Sports, a subsidiary of GMR Group, a infrastructure company in India Marquee Proteas player: Kagiso Rabada Ground: Wanderers Why the owner chose Johannesburg: &#8220;It&#8217;s a big city.
