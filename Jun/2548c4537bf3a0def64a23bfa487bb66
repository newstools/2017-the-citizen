Prominent businessman Saki Macozoma on Thursday was appointed as lead independent director of the Vodacom Group and also into the company s audit risk and compliance committee with effect from Wednesday, July 19. Macozoma is currently the chairperson of Safika Holdings, as well as Tshipi Ntle and Ntsimbintle Mining, and a director at Volkswagen South Africa. He is a former chairperson of Liberty Life Holdings and chairperson of Standard Bank. He was also a president of Business Leadership South Africa (Busa). In 2012, Macozoma was recognised for his work in civil society when the University of South Africa (Unisa), his alma mater, bestowed on him the Calabash award for his fight against oppression during the apartheid era. The Calabash award is one of the highest honours that could be bestowed on an individual by Unisa. The news of Macozoma s appointment comes as Vodacom announced board changes on Thursday, including the appointment of Jabu Moleketi, the current independent non-executive director, as chairperson of the company with effect from July 19. Moleketi will succeed Peter Moyo, who in April announced that he will retire and step down from the board at the forthcoming annual general meeting to be held on July 18. Moleketi was first appointed to the board of Vodacom in November 2009. He will also take over as chairperson of the Nomination Committee and step down from the audit, risk and compliance committee.
