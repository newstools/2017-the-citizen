President Jacob Zuma will attend the 5th Southern African Customs Union (Sacu) summit to be held on June 23 in Swaziland, the presidency said on Sunday. Sacu, the oldest customs union in the world, is constituted of Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa, and Swaziland. The summit of heads of state and government of Sacu met on an annual basis to discuss progress in implementation of the agreed work programme. The summit also followed high level consultative meetings by Zuma in 2016 to discuss the Sacu work programme, the presidency said in a statement. Swaziland as the current chair of Sacu had successfully led a process that facilitated discussions within Sacu on the transformation of Sacu towards a developmental integration agenda. The summit would receive and consider a report from council on its activities with the purpose of providing strategic direction on development integration in Sacu and to ensure that the Sacu agreement facilitated implementation of this agenda. Zuma would be accompanied by Trade and Industry Minister Rob Davies, International Relations and Co-operation Minister Maite Nkoana-Mashabane, and Deputy Finance Minister Sifiso Buthelezi, the presidency said.
