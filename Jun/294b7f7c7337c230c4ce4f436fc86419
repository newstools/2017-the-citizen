It s early days yet but the Springboks last week took a big step towards restoring pride in the national rugby jersey. They defeated France 37-14 at Loftus Versfeld in the first of three Tests last Saturday. Nothing less than similar strong performances against the Tricolors in Durban today and at Ellis Park next weekend will be accepted by the team s fans, who endured a horrible 2016, where they won just four out of 12 Tests under coach Allister Coetzee. Even convincing victories will still be viewed with scepticism as France, who have rung the changes after several first-choice players missed the first Test due to last Sunday s French Top 14 final between Toulon and Clermont, are a shadow of the side in their glory days. They didn t have the best Six Nations campaign earlier this year, winning three of five Tests, and they are ranked eighth in the world. South Africa climbed two places to fifth after last weekend s win. Bigger challenges await in the Rugby Championship against New Zealand, who yesterday showed why they are so dangerous with a 12-try 78-0 win over Samoa in Auckland, Australia and Argentina later this year. But a win today in Durban would go a long way in creating that winning culture again. A poor performance, however, will see the knives sharpened for Coetzee and company.
