A presidential protection officer who allegedly murdered his wife and daughter two years ago is to go on trial in the High Court in Pretoria this week. Warrant Officer Benedict Peloeole is expected to plead not guilty to two charges of murder when his trial starts. Peloeole, who was from the protection unit at the Union Buildings in Pretoria, is accused of murdering his wife, Jane, 42, and daughter, Tsholofelo, 23, at their house in Westville, Pretoria West, on the night of September 12, 2015. The couple allegedly had an argument earlier in the day before Peloeole left for his cousin s funeral. On his return, he allegedly asked his wife to cook for him and then went to another room to get his firearm. He shot his wife while she was preparing the food, and his daughter, who was sitting in the lounge. Both of his family members died of gunshot wounds to their upper bodies on the scene. According to information released by the police at the time, Peloeole allegedly took his son and nephew to a neighbour s house after the shooting and then asked the neighbour to drive him to the police station, where he was arrested. The police later confiscated Peloeole s service pistol, which was at his house. The policeman will remain in custody.
