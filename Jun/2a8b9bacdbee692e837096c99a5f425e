In the video, Hunt can be seen showing his players how a winning coach should celebrate, as they clap to the music. The coach has every reason to celebrate after beating Mamelodi Sundowns to win his fourth Absa Premiership title (three with SuperSport United) when he led the Clever Boys to the 2016/17 title last month. The coach probably dances better than his players or you. Watch the video below: Never knew Gavin Hunt was good on the dance floor like this and with the brown bottle. pic.twitter.com/4BMFFvvUxq &mdash; Dominic Chimhavi (@DChimhavi) 23 June 2017 Would you like to place a soccer bet?
