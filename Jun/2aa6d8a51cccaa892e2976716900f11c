It is shocking to think that half a million chickens are going to have to be culled as part of an attempt to stop the spread of the bird flu virus. It s the largest mass culling of animals in this country s history and there have already been concerns expressed by the National SPCA about whether the killings will be done humanely. So it is comforting to hear that the poultry industry has pledged to use methods which involve the least amount of pain and discomfort for the birds. The reality is that allowing the birds to live will be even more cruel, because the longer they live, the more they will suffer. Also, destroying the birds is the only effective solution to stopping the spread of avian flu. But the bigger tragedy is for the local poultry industry, which has already had to lay off hundreds of workers because of what it claims is unfair competition from subsidised foreign chicken imports. While humans are not affected by this particular strain of avian flu, the worry is that the virus could spread and affect the rest of the 140 million national chicken flock. That will turn a tragedy into a catastrophe.
