 It is hectic on our roads this morning. Most of our freeways and highways are blocked. This includes the N12, the N1, and it is worse in Pretoria because the R80 to Soshanguve and Mabopane is blocked, Gauteng Traffic spokesperson Busaphi Nxumalo told the African News Agency (ANA). There is no movement on the R21 at Flying Saucer [interchange] from Pretoria. That is where the challenges are. Nxumalo said the protesting taxis had also hijacked heavy trucks and were using them to block the freeways. Our guys [traffic police] have been there, removing these taxis from the road. As of now, we have impounded more than 17 taxis which were blocking the roads. They are now hijacking trucks and using them to block. They are actually taking the keys from the truck drivers, said Nxumalo. She said earlier, in a bid to scare motorists around the Mall of Africa in Midrand, some taxi drivers had fired shots in the air. They are trying to scare people using alternative means for transport. Remember, we have alternative routes like the R101 and some people had used such roads to get to their destinations. Our officers rushed there and we are on the scene. We are still looking for that taxi, obviously it has firearms, said Nxumalo. She appealed to road users to venture onto the roads only after ascertaining whether it was safe. I cannot say people should not go to work, but they must use alternative routes, not the major freeways. The Tshwane Metro Police on Wednesday said the protest was illegal. The taxi operators, aligned to the South African National Taxi Council, are protesting against what they call high repayment fees on their vehicles. African News Agency (ANA)
