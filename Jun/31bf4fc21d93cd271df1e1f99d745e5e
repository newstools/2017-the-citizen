Betting opened at all TAB branches around the country yesterday for this year s R4.25 million Vodacom Durban July and once again there is huge money to be won on one the great racing events in the world. This year a pair of three-year-old colts are vying for favouritism, Edict Of Nantes, trained by Brett Crawford, and Al Sahem, trained by Sean Tarry. With 18 runners in the field at Greyville Racecourse on Saturday, TAB will be paying out Place bets for the first six horses past the post. As has so often been proven, any horse, no matter the price, is capable of finishing sixth so if you like that 50/1 shot, a Place bet is the way to go. Other bets available are an Exacta, which is the first two past the post in the correct order, a Trifecta, the first three past the post in the correct order, and a Quartet, the first four past the post in the correct order. The Quartet is a great bet as it often pays out huge amounts. This year the pool will get a huge boost and will kick-off with a carryover of R1.2 million. A pool of R13 million is guaranteed but it is likely to reach at least R15 million. The Pick 6 pool will start with a carryover of R2 million and is guaranteed to reach R10 million.
