Suspended national police commissioner Riah Phiyega and suspended crime intelligence boss Richard Mdluli have been earning salaries, bonuses and other benefits to the tune of over R11.5 million while sitting at home, police minister Fikile Mbalula revealed in an answer to a parliamentary question published on Tuesday. Mbalula said Phiyega had been on suspension from October 14, 2015 receiving a salary of R2,095.802.70 million, a non-pensionable cash allowance of R562,541.23, and a head of department allowance of R299,244.08 up until April this year. In addition, contributions to her pension fund totalled R335,130.47. The total cost to the fiscus was R3.2 million. Mdluli, who has been on suspension from May 8, 2011, had benefitted more than double that in taxpayers money. From 2011 up to April this year, Mdluli had received salaries and other benefits to the tune of R8.3 million. This included R4,985,795.27 million for his basic salary, R1,392,536.94 as a non-pensionable cash allowance, R717,741.94 in car allowances and a service bonus of R413,957.25. Asked about disciplinary proceedings against Mdluli and the timelines involved, Mbalula had only this to say: An internal disciplinary process has been initiated, functionaries have been appointed and the process is underway. Democratic Alliance MP Zakhele Mbhele said disciplinary proceedings against Mdluli must be fast-tracked to avoid public funds being squandered. South Africans live in fear each and every single day. Yet millions of rand of public funds have been wasted on paying two individuals, who were clearly not fit for their jobs in the first place, to stay at home and twiddle their thumbs. This is unacceptable, said Mbhele. It is absolutely imperative that we have fit and proper leadership in the police so that these millions, that could have been spent on our severely under-resourced police, are not wasted on failed SAPS leadership.
