The National Union of Mineworkers (Num) on Thursday said it would first study the 2017 Mining Charter before it puts forward its position. The charter, released and gazetted by Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane on Thursday morning, includes raising black ownership targets for new mining rights holders to 30 percent to be shared among employees, communities and black entrepreneurs. Mining rights holders who have complied with the previous target of 26 percent have to top up to 30 percent within 12 months. Those applying for prospecting rights would be required to have a minimum of 50 percent plus one black person shareholding . These shareholders must have voting rights. The union will study the charter and aligned it with various union submissions to the Department of Mineral Resources during the consultation period. Most importantly in the areas of ownership (with specific focus on employee share ownership schemes), Human Resource Development, Employment Equity and Housing and Living Conditions (especially ensuring mining companies contribute financially towards employee accessing home ownership), Num said in a statement. The Mining Chamber of South Africa on Thursday rejected the targets saying they were not workable, adding that it was consulting its lawyers on interdicting Zwane from implementing the charter.
