Eskom said on Friday that two men had been arrested at its Zeus substation near Secunda, in Mpumalanga, for attempting to steal cables. Eskom said the two were part of a group of five that had been spotted on Sunday near the substation, which had been a target for cable theft in recent weeks. The power utility said when the men realised that they had been seen by security guards on duty at the substation, they attempted to flee the scene. The guards gave chase and apprehended the two suspects. Eskom divisional executive for security, Tebogo Rakau, said the two had with them hacksaws and carry bags believed to be intended for cutting and stealing copper cable at the substation. We decided to beef up security at Zeus substation following an increase in cable theft in recent weeks, Rakau said. Cable theft at the substation and the resultant power outages negatively impact on our customers who are supplied by Zeus substation. Rakau urged communities to report suspected cable theft anonymously by sending a detailed SMS tip-off to Crime Line.
