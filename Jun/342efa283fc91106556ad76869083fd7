While Springboks coach Allister Coetzee&#8217;s had to make two injury-enforced changes to his match squad for Saturday&#8217;s third Test against France at Ellis Park, there was one interesting switch. Earlier in the week, Coetzee mentioned how he wanted to keep changes to a minimum. Why then is Jesse Kriel back in the No 13 jersey when Lionel Mapoe played well last week in Durban?

He gives us strong defence, width and communication,&#8221; said Coetzee. &#8220;There s not a lot in it in terms of selection at outside centre, but he and Jan Serfontein are partners on and off the field, they get along well.&#8221; While there&#8217;s clearly not a lack of conviction, Coetzee admits it wasn&#8217;t an easy decision. &#8220;I m excited for the people who are catching an opportunity, but you always feel terrible when you have to leave people out. We are under no illusions that we have been perfect and we have to go and execute our simple plan even better and show progression,&#8221; he said. That progression seems to entail seeing Serfontein and Kriel as his best combination in midfield come the Rugby Championship. The Springboks coach confirmed that the in-form Serfontein, who has turned down a new Springbok contract and will head overseas, will be available during the tournament. It means he can complete the required 30 or more Tests to continue playing for the Springboks when he starts playing on foreign shores. More importantly, the Bulls duo can then grow into a potentially formidable partnership. Yet it&#8217;s also Kriel&#8217;s superior communication skills that trumps Mapoe&#8217;s energy and steadiness. &#8220;Jesse s ability to communicate is an important skill though, because he can help the wingers to make sure the defence is solid, the French backs are always putting us under pressure there,&#8221; said Coetzee.
