Taken from BBC network, the show aims to entertain viewers with witty and daring single hopefuls who seek to find love through the match-making game show. Host Phat Joe, who is better known for his tongue-in-cheek humour, sometimes controversial, will be hosting the show, formerly an SABC 1 production. The show is said to return to TV on July 10 on DSTV youth channel Vuzu Amp. Speaking on the new concept for the show, Sphumelele Sibeko, M-Net s head of reality for local entertainment channels, said: Viewers are in for a treat this July Take Me Out Mzansi has all the ingredients for a weekly dose of great viewing: humour, surprises, romance and unadulterated fun. Phat Joe tops off an already perfect mix, to make for brilliant television. During its session, viewers can hope to see eligible bachelors being introduced to a panel of 30 girls or boys, who we will then try to persuade them to keep their lights on so he or she can choose one for a potential date. The show provides an entertaining mix of comedy, jeopardy, surprises and possible romance. In this show, first impressions do count. Will the panel like what they see, or will the player prove one big turn-off? If the panel are not impressed, they can switch off their podium lights immediately, and if it is a total blackout , the player instantly goes home dateless. Even if the player scores well at first glance, they will need to further impress the panel with skill, charm or hidden talents, while an interview with an overbearing mom or jealous ex may creep in, just to up the drama. Once a match has been made, couples will be taken out on the ultimate date, which will be captured on camera for all to be revealed on the next show.
