The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) said on Wednesday that it will embark on a protected strike at Msobo Coal mine in Mpumalanga after the company withdrew from the centralised bargaining forum by the Chamber of Mines. Coal companies including Anglo American Coal, Msobo Coal, Delmas Coal, Exxaro Coal Mpumalanga, Kangra Coal, Koornfontein Mines and Glencore indicated in 2016 that they intended to negotiate wages, and terms and conditions of employment on a decentralised basis with effect from this year. NUM chief negotiator in the coal sector, Peter Bailey, said the strike was expected to begin next week Tuesday. Bailey said the purpose of the strike was to compel Msobo Coal and its management to comply with the recommendations of the advisory award, and to align itself with the process of wage negotiations that is currently ongoing at the Chamber. After the withdrawal from the centralised wage forum by the chamber and the subsequent return of 2017 wage negotiations, Msobo Coal chose to resign with immediate effect from the Chamber without consulting the NUM, Bailey said. The NUM met on Tuesday this week with its members who have decided to serve the company with a notice to embark on a strike action as from the morning of Tuesday the 20th of June 2017. The strike will include every shift that follows thereafter and will continue indefinitely until our demands are complied with. In December, the NUM went on a protected strike at Msobo Coal mine after the company issued workers with section 189 retrenchment notices a year before and consultation broke down at the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA)
