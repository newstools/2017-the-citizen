One of the public protector&#8217;s areas of inquiry regarding the Bapo ba Mogale matter was to ascertain the facts around &#8220;alleged failure on the part of the HoD of local government and traditional affairs and the Bapo administration in the management of the Bapo ba Mogale D-account [sic] and if so, whether such failure constitutes maladministration&#8221;. Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane subsequently found that &#8220;the allegation the HoD of the department and Bapo administration failed in the management of Bapo ba Mogale D-account is substained&#8221;. In her report, she further wrote: &#8220;In respect of Trunk Roads, the matter requires further investigation to ascertain the maladministration that was committed in the circumstances.&#8221; In her remedial action section of the report, Mkhwebane&#8217;s provincial representative for her office in North West, Sechele Keebine, and senior investigator Ike Motshegare released adverse findings against Nkambule &amp; Associates regarding trunk roads. North West Premier Supra Mahumapelo was directed to &#8220;initiate&#8221; a process, with the assistance of the SIU, to recoup &#8220;the payment of an amount of R20 243 146.85 paid to Nkambule and Associates on the construction of trunk roads in Wonderkop and Greater Bapong areas&#8221;.

The &#8216;Correspondence Sent and Received&#8217; section also corroborates accusations that the service provider was never communicated or consulted. Where the report deals with &#8220;construction of trunk roads in greater Bapong&#8221;, it states that &#8220;a total of R35 968.78 was incurred towards the construction of the trunk roads in Wonderkop and Greater Bapong area under tender BMC TC 02/12 and BBMTC RD0/11&#8221;. The construction companies were &#8220;King Civils/Masiana JV and Nkambule &amp; Associates using labour intensive methods&#8221;. &#8220;However, it is the view of the public protector that the role of Nkambule &amp; Associates in projects within Bapo needs further scrutiny by a forensic auditor after being paid an amount of R20 243.85 million.&#8221; Dismayed by Mkhwebane&#8217;s findings, Ishmail Musiyiwa of Nkambule &amp; Associates contends that, had the public protector&#8217;s office taken the time to interrogate the matter through contact with the company, she would have been given information that they &#8220;acknowledge being paid for the work we carried out&#8221;. Nkambule &amp; Associates is not a construction company &#8220;Nkambule &amp; Associates is not a construction company, but a civil engineering consultancy firm,&#8221; Musiyiwa clarified, then elaborated that they &#8220;were appointed in May 2010 for upgrading of trunk roads &#8230; from earth to tar standard&#8221;. He further informed The Citizen there were seven roads needing upgrades: Wonderkop (3.8 km); Seqwaelane 93.7 km); Tribal access road (0.5 km); Oustad (2 km); Nommer One (6.4 km); Netown (5.3 km) and Leokeng (1.9 km). &#8220;The approximate costs to construct these roads was around R200-million then. Engineering designs for these roads are complete, and the projects are at pre-tender stage. Also, the first three roads were taken out to tender in November 2011 and only one road, &#8216;Wonderkop trunk roads project&#8217;, was awarded to King Civils as the main contractor,&#8221; the company said in an email to The Citizen. &#8220;Our firm was responsible for construction supervision and contract administration. This project is 100% complete, and there are no outstanding issues. Due to budgetary constraints, all other roads are still to be constructed. &#8220;Nkambule &amp; Associates were paid professional fees and disbursements for the engineering designs and tender documentation. The client is in possession of all the project documents,&#8221; Musiyiwa said. Nkambule &amp; Associates&#8217; response is consistent with the Absa communications division&#8217;s argument earlier this week that, in the Absa/Bankcorp report, the public protector s report appears to have either effectively ignored or misunderstood Absa s detailed submissions which were made to it on two occasions . Absa says it won&#8217;t pay back the money For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter
