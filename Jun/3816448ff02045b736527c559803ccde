Nissan has unveiled the Navara (Frontier, as it is known in South America) Attack concept at the Buenos Aires Auto Show. . Created by the Nissan Design Center in Rio de Janeiro, the concept draws inspiration from the unfriendly terrain of Latin America, and previews a potential production model. Nissan did not have much to say about the bakkie, but it features a rugged appearance thanks to a bright skid plate, a roll bar, and massive Yokohama off-road tyres. The concept has also been equipped with tinted headlights, side steps and a luggage rack. The unique styling continues in the cabin as designers installed cloth and leather seats with red contrast stitching and &#8216;Attack&#8217; embroidery. Drivers will also find gloss black accents, red trim and a 6.2-inch touchscreen infotainment system with GPS navigation. . Motivation is provided by a 2.3-litre diesel engine that produces 139kW and 450 Nm of torque. It is connected to a six-speed manual transmission that sends power to a four-wheel drive system. Since the bakkie was designed to go off-road, it features Hill Start Assist and Hill Descent Control. . The concept also has a Vehicle Dynamic Control System, which electronically controls the vehicle&#8217;s traction, and prevents it from skidding, overturning or losing control.
