The ringside doctor at a fight where an Australian boxer died should have intervened when he showed signs of concussion, a Sydney coroner found on Thursday. He also criticising the referee for not stopping the bout. Davey Browne Jr died in hospital from a brain injury four days after he was knocked out 30 seconds from the end of the super featherweight 12-round contest against Carlo Magali of the Philippines in Sydney in September 2015. Deputy New South Wales state coroner, magistrate Teresa O&#8217;Sullivan, said the 28-year-old father-of-two&#8217;s death was &#8220;preventable&#8221;. &#8220;The seriousness of his condition at the end of round 11 was recognised by a number of witnesses present at the time, albeit with the benefit of hindsight,&#8221; she said in her findings. &#8220;Action could have been taken to examine Davey and stop the fight prior to the point when it ended in the 12th round.&#8221; O&#8217;Sullivan criticised attending physician Lawrence Noonan, who said he did not act because the referee had not stopped the fight, and recommended that a ringside doctor&#8217;s obligations to intervene should be strengthened. She described Noonan&#8217;s approach as a &#8220;manifestly inadequate method to assess whether Davey had sustained or recovered from concussion and whether he was fit to continue&#8221;, and also censured referee Charlie Lucas. &#8220;Mr Lucas&#8217;s failure to recognise the seriousness of Davey&#8217;s condition serves to emphasise the need for an examination by a ringside doctor who is trained to detect concussion, to properly assess a fighter&#8217;s fitness to continue,&#8221; she said. She called for more comprehensive state regulations, noting it was a &#8220;striking feature of the evidence that many witnesses did not know which rules applied to this contest, and had a flawed understanding of the rules&#8221;. Regulations around boxing differ across state lines in Australia. Browne&#8217;s widow Amy Lavelle said outside the court she was hopeful the findings would prevent future incidents. &#8220;I guess it just provides a bit of satisfaction and pleasure to gain acknowledgement about what happened,&#8221; the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported her as saying. &#8220;He was a very gentle person. He was just a fighter in the ring, it was a sport for him. He was very skilled at it and he had many titles.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
