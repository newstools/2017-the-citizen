Two men were arrested with a rented vehicle filled with suspected stolen items and housebreaking implements following a high speed chase on Borcherds Quarry road near the Cape Town International Airport on Thursday, Western Cape police said. Police spokeswoman Noloyiso Rwexana said the vigilance of members of the public order policing unit who noticed a BMW loaded with what looked like flat screen television sets covered with sheets led to the find. Police signalled for the vehicle to stop but the driver sped off and a car chase ensued. One of the suspects who was sitting on the back seat pointed a firearm at police twice but that did not stop the members from continuing the pursuit, said Rwexana. Upon searching the vehicle six flat screens, three laptops, various items of jewellery, cell phones, a variety of perfumes, bags, a safe and several other items, including housebreaking implements were found. Preliminary investigations revealed that the BMW used was a rented vehicle, but had false registration plates. Two suspects, aged 40 and 34, were expected to appear in court on charges of possession of stolen property, pointing a firearm and housebreaking. African News Agency (ANA)
