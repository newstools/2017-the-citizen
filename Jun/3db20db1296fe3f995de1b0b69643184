18:59 And that&#8217;s that! The Springboks have achieved the 3-0 whitewash! Also, a first win over France at Ellis Park! It ends 35-12 and there&#8217;s a lot to be excited about! 18:57 One thing is clear is that the bond in the team is strong.Look at celebration after Rudy Paige&#39;s try. Game was already won. That says heaps. &mdash; Brenden Nel (@BrendenNel) June 24, 2017 Must say the Bok camp gees is a joy to behold. Not world-beaters yet, but &#8230; &mdash; Rob Houwing (@RobHouwing) June 24, 2017 &nbsp; 18:52 SPRINGBOKS 35 &#8211; FRANCE 12 (Try Rudy Paige) It&#8217;s been a good night for the struggling Bulls players! Now, Rudy Paige has a first Test try after Bongi Mbonambi broke from line-out and delivered a superb off-load. 18:51 Boks have had more of an arm wrestle tonight, and French have been feisty. But this should go down as a solid win nevertheless. &mdash; Brenden Nel (@BrendenNel) June 24, 2017 18:44 Given his chastening season to date, it really does feel that way&#8230; Is that the first really kwaai thing Lood de Jager has done this season? #AskingForNollis &mdash; stuart hess (@shockerhess) June 24, 2017 18:38 Exceptional skill by Steven Kitshoff after bullocking Pieter-Steph du Toit run &#8230;but again Springboks just can&#39;t round off. Still on attack &mdash; Ken Borland (@KenBorland) June 24, 2017 18:35 SPRINGBOKS 28 &#8211; FRANCE 12 (Try Malcolm Marx) It&#8217;s messy for the Boks from a line-out before Pieter-Steph du Toit bursts through a gap. Steven Kitshoff is held up before Marx scores a first Test try on his home ground. 18:29 SPRINGBOKS 21 &#8211; FRANCE 12 (Penalty Jules Plisson) Eben Etzebeth interferes in a line-out and immediately apologises for his error. But it&#8217;s still a penalty and Plisson converts. 18:23 Yeah, well, people like us who pay through our noses for data might have mixed feelings over this&#8230; No, this is not an argument about free data. This is happiness about scoring a test try! @EbenEtzebeth @MTNza pic.twitter.com/BlOqYE7MpB &mdash; South African Rugby (@Springboks) June 24, 2017 18:20 It&#8217;s been confirmed that 55 820 are at Ellis Park tonight. That certainly is a vote of confidence for the direction the Boks are going. 18:13 SPRINGBOKS 21 &#8211; FRANCE 9 (Try Eben Etzebeth) Classic Springboks rugby. An early penalty is sent to the corner. Centre Jan Serfontein is the unexpected line-out receiver, giving South Africa more beef for the maul. Skipper for the day Eben Etzebeth bursts over. 18:03 This Test certainly has a dead rubber look and feel. &mdash; Rob Houwing (@RobHouwing) June 24, 2017 17:57 SPRINGBOKS 16 &#8211; FRANCE 9 (Penalty Jules Plisson) It&#8217;s half-time. The Springboks&#8217; front row collapses at a scrum. And France have some momentum going into the second half. 17:52 SPRINGBOKS 16 &#8211; FRANCE 6 (Penalty Elton Jantjies) Jan Serfontein&#8217;s beautiful midfield break gives the Springboks some momentum. But the follow-up play is rather stilted. Nonetheless, the French are penalised again. Jantjies slots a superb goal kick. 17:48 Yeah, the game has lost a bit of its fizz. Not the most fluent game&#8230;. &mdash; stuart hess (@shockerhess) June 24, 2017 17:40 Bok defence has been the hallmark of their test series thus far. Brendan Venter has done exceptionally well. Would be bad if that changes. &mdash; Brenden Nel (@BrendenNel) June 24, 2017 17:37 Cynical from the &#8220;former&#8221; Springboks coach! The great thing about giving Etsebeth the captaincy is that Kolisi will also be captain for at least 10min in the match #YellowCard &mdash; Peter de Villiers (@Coachdivvy) June 24, 2017 17:35 SPRINGBOKS 13 &#8211; FRANCE 6 (Penalty Elton Jantjies) It&#8217;s all actually been quite sloppy from the Springboks the past few minutes. But they again keep the French in their own half, who make life difficult for themselves by coming in from the side. Jantjies is back on target. 17:30 Is that why he missed? I hope Elton didn&#39;t pay that barber who cut his hair,Damn &mdash; Breyton Paulse (@BreytonPaulse) June 24, 2017 17:27 SPRINGBOKS 10 &#8211; FRANCE 6 (Penalty Plisson) Just after Elton Jantjies misses a fairly easy penalty, Francois Hougaard&#8217;s wayward pass puts the Boks under pressure. Beast Mtawarira holds on. 17:25 Support from a Protea in Cardiff! Lets go @Springboks. #SAvsFRA &mdash; David Miller (@DavidMillerSA12) June 24, 2017 17:23 SPRINGBOKS 10 &#8211; FRANCE 3 (Penalty Jules Pilsson) Beast Mtawarira goes high with a tackle. Good strike by Pilsson. 17:22 The French are indeed haphazard. Its going to be a long afternoon for France if thats how they want to play #Ssrugby #savfra &mdash; Brenden Nel (@BrendenNel) June 24, 2017 17:20 SPRINGBOKS 10 &#8211; FRANCE 0 (Try Jesse Kriel) A magnificent tackle by Jan Serfontein pins the French, who are held up in a maul. Franco Mostert rips the ball free, feeds debutant Ruan Dreyer, who passes to Kriel. Brilliant counterattacking play. 17:19 Jaco Kriel may not be biggest flank at just 99kg but he blasts through tackles. Great run, France forced to concede penalty &#8211; Jantjies 3-0 &mdash; Ken Borland (@KenBorland) June 24, 2017 17:17 SPRINGBOKS 3 &#8211; FRANCE 0 (Penalty Elton Jantjies) Good cover defence by Jesse Kriel gives the Springboks field position on halfway. Jaco Kriel shows impressive upper body strength with a fine run and forces the French to go off their feet. Elton Jantjies continues his fine kicking form. 17:14 Kick-off and it&#8217;s the French that have most of the possession. But the Springboks&#8217; defence is solid and forces the French to kick into touch. 17:05 Well, he is after all the new Springboks captain&#8230; Eben Etzebeth, @ebenetzebeth is now trending in #Johannesburghttps://t.co/Plq56hxyEG pic.twitter.com/ykSOXo20Y1 &mdash; Trendsmap Jo&#39;burg (@TrendsJoBurg) June 24, 2017 17:02 This puts the horrors of 2016 into a fairly positive perspective. The Springboks have scored 74 points in the last 2 tests. That s the most points they ve scored over 2 tests since the 2015 World Cup. pic.twitter.com/Qvqmf4IqjA &mdash; SuperSport (@SuperSportTV) June 24, 2017 16:53 Indeed, 22 years ago on the same ground the Springboks won the 1995 World Cup title. Brendan Venter running the players through warmup. 22 years ago to the day, he was a player running warm-ups before RWC final. #RSAvFRA &mdash; Craig Ray (@craigray11) June 24, 2017 16:52 Fair to say that everyone came out to play at Emirates Airline Park today! Lots of fun, with the serious stuff coming a bit later. @MTNza pic.twitter.com/7rFIV2Hi0Z &mdash; South African Rugby (@Springboks) June 24, 2017 16:40 Interestingly, the French have a perfect record at Ellis Park. They&#8217;ve won all of their Tests here since 1958. Hopefully the Springboks break their hoodoo. 16:35 That Frans Steyn is at it again! Frans Steyn just smashed a few 55m drop goals during warm-up. Still gives it a hoof. #RSAvFRA #rugby &mdash; Craig Ray (@craigray11) June 24, 2017 15:50 The revised Springboks team: 15 Andries Coetzee, 14 Raymond Rhule, 13 Jesse Kriel, 12 Jan Serfontein, 11 Courtnall Skosan, 10 Elton Jantjies, 9 Francois Hougaard, 8 Jean-Luc du Preez, 7 Jaco Kriel, 6 Siya Kolisi, 5 Franco Mostert, 4 Eben Etzebeth (c), 3 Ruan Dreyer, 2 Malcolm Marx, 1 Beast Mtawarira Bench: 16 Bongi Mbonambi, 17 Steven Kitshoff, 18 Coenie Oosthuizen, 19 Pieter-Steph du Toit, 20 Lood de Jager, 21 Rudy Paige, 22 Frans Steyn, 23 Dillyn Leyds 15:46 Interesting call by Coetzee to make Etzebeth capt ahead of Kolisi (in the absence of Whiteley). Kolisi leads Stormers in SR (Eben is vice) &mdash; Jon Cardinelli (@jon_cardinelli) June 24, 2017 Warren Whiteley is out of the test. JACO kriel replaces him. Eben Etzebeth to lead the team #springboks &mdash; Brenden Nel (@BrendenNel) June 24, 2017 15:45 We start with some big news regarding the game. Captain Warren Whiteley has been withdrawn with a groin injury. He&#8217;ll be replaced as skipper by Eben Etzebeth. Jaco Kriel will take his place in the starting line-up, with Jean-Luc du Preez playing at No 8. 15:45 Welcome to our coverage of the third Test between the Springboks and France.
