He said his father was bedridden for a long time, and was being taken care of by his mother, the late actor&#8217;s wife. The actor&#8217;s condition started deteriorating from last month, then on Saturday, it worsened, and he was taken to Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital. At 11am on Sunday, he passed away. &#8220;To the world, he was known as ntate Jwara, Jackson Senzekile, but at home, all I can say is that he was the best husband to my mom, and the best father to myself and my siblings. &#8220;One thing we will always remember him for is his sense of humour. Even when he was sick, he still had that sense of humour. People would come home to pay him a visit, and because he could not walk anymore, he would say: &#8216;Look, why do you come here because I should be paying you a visit?&#8217; &#8220;Those are the memories we&#8217;ll have of him,&#8221; said Zolani. Veteran actor David Phetoe said Sixolo was like a brother-in-law to him, as his wife came from the same clan as him. &#8220;I remember him telling me his history, saying he started at Bethel College singing, and continued with it until he became matured.&#8221; He did a lot of travelling, during which he met his wife, said Phetoe. Sixolo was a language adviser to some of the productions Phetoe worked with, including Generations. &#8220;It was a marvellous feeling working with it because he took everything personally, and turned it into quality,&#8221; said Phetoe.
