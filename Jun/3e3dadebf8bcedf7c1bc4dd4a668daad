An alleged racist incident was recorded in writing as a complaint about a security guard to G4S Security by an employee of Sahara and is one of hundreds of leaked Gupta emails which City Press has reportedly obtained. News24 reports that it is alleged Tony &#8220;Rajesh&#8221; Gupta in 2012 called security guards &#8220;monkeys&#8221; after they did not respond to his call for them at his Saxonwold house to inform them that a guest would be arriving. It is alleged that he was aggravated that the guards did not hear him and called them &#8220;monkeys&#8221;. The emails further alleged that on Atul Gupta&#8217;s orders, a guard was made to face the guard room camera at all times and when the guard at 4.30am said he would not sleep now, G4S is believed to have responded that the guard would be sent for customer service training and that disciplinary action would be taken if there was no improvement. News24 pointed to previous accusations of &#8220;bad treatment&#8221; towards staff by the Gupta family, for example the Mail &amp; Guardian had reportedly previously reported that the guards would work 18-hour shifts at times and that they could be dismissed immediately. According to News24, the lawyer for the Guptas, Gert van der Merwe, has criticised the accusations that had been contained in the leaked emails. Further it was reported that the family had received advice to lay criminal charges against those who report on them.
