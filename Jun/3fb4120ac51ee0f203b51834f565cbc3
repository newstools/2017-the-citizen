The past few days on Twitter haven&#8217;t been good for top motivational speaker and businessman Vusi Thembekwayo. After being involved in a war of words with Radio 702 radio presenter Dhlomo, in which the DJ accused him of plagiarising his tweets on the taxi industry, Thembekwayo was roasted by EFF spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi for having a &#8216;small mind.&#8217; It all started when the EFF held their annual youth rally at Boipatong, south of Johannesburg, on Friday. During his speech, EFF commander in chief Julius Malema told the crowd it was time they pushed to build factories and not malls in the townships. He said mass industrialisation was the key to eliminating poverty and economic freedom. Malema was reintroducing the EFF&#8217;s manifesto, drafted at its founding almost three years ago. #Malema: if you want a Mall, don&#39;t vote the EFF because we won&#39;t build malls but we will build factories, firms and industries! #EFFJune16 &mdash; EFF Official Account (@EFFSouthAfrica) June 16, 2017 #Malema: every township built by the township has a mall. How do you buy from malls when you&#39;re not employed? #EFFJune16 &mdash; EFF Official Account (@EFFSouthAfrica) June 16, 2017 Thembekwayo then tweeted: &#8220;I see my idea of building factories &amp; not malls is finally being championed by a political org. Kuhle (that&#8217;s good) (next build factories in townships!).&#8221; His tweet was then quoted by Ndlozi, who added that Thembekwayo had no intellectual integrity and had developed a false sense of self-identity. Here is a sign of small mind; no intellectual integrity. Also, due to their small reading lists, they develop a false sense of self identity https://t.co/NK4hIiyi55 &mdash; IG: @MbuyiseniNdlozi (@MbuyiseniNdlozi) June 17, 2017 One Twitter follower pointed out that Thembekwayo had probably not read the EFF manifesto and directed him to it. MALIKA @VusiThembekwayo is grand standing here &amp; a bit disrespectful .EFF manifesto was drafted long time ago. He must go read it all! pic.twitter.com/llVES01jn3 &mdash; Siphiwe Likhuleni (@siplikhuleni) June 17, 2017 READ MORE: Insults fly as Sizwe accuses Vusi of plagiarism in Twitter war For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
