Bongekile &#8216;Babes Wodumo&#8217; Simelane has landed herself on to the Twitter trends list after reportedly failing to secure her travel documents on time. The queen of Gqom, Nasty C and AKA have been nominated for the 2017 BET Awards, and will be representing the country for the Best International Act: Africa. But it seems Babes Wodumo and her manager, Mandla &#8216;Mampintsha&#8217; Maphumulo, also her rumoured bae, will not be able to attend the awards set to take place at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles, on Sunday, as IOL has reported the two failed to apply for their travel visa on time. The two reportedly only went to the American Embassy offices in Durban on Tuesday. They were too late, as applicants have to schedule for interviews for the visas at least 60 days before the travel date. This despite her informing followers in May that she was ready for the trip, though she used the wrong flag in her tweet. https://twitter.com/BABESWODUMO/status/865087467371859968 However, all of this is Mampintsha&#8217;s fault, according to Twitter. In fact, the Wololo hit maker should consider getting a new team, as the current one is apparently not doing a good job. &#8220;Babes is talented but Mampintsha is &#8216;pitshizing&#8217; her career. He is failing babes. Visa is the first step nje mawuya ngaphandle,&#8221; said one of her followers, while another said: &#8220;Babes should&#8217;ve known, after being nominated, it means you should start with your VISAs and shid.&#8221; Check out the reactions on Twitter: Babes could not get a US visa: ninomona pic.twitter.com/XNJQenYuoy &mdash; lukhanyo kwelilanga (@kwelilanga16) June 22, 2017 So babes wodumo forget the most important thing for the #BETAwards A visa pic.twitter.com/fgJWD8thSR &mdash; Noma.
