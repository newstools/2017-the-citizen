Store bought granola can be very unhealthy, and good quality granola can be very expensive. That is why making your own is a much better idea. It allows you to control exactly what ingredients go into it. Enjoy with fruit and yoghurt, milk or plain as a snack. Chocolate granola Ingredients 1/3 cup coconut oil 1/3 cup cacao powder cup maple syrup 3 cups Pouyoukas whole rolled oats cup dried cranberries cup shredded coconut cup Pouyoukas pumpkin seeds 1/3 cup raw cacao nibs 3 tablespoons chia seeds 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon &nbsp; Instructions Preheat oven to 180 C. Melt the coconut oil in a small pot on the stove. Add the cacao powder and maple syrup and stir on low heat until combined. Remove from heat and set aside. In a large bowl combine the oats, cranberries, coconut, pumpkin seeds, raw cacao nibs, chia seeds and cinnamon. Pour the chocolate mixture over oat mixture and mix until fully combined. Give it a taste test. If you want it sweeter, you can add a touch more maple syrup. Spread flat on a pan and bake for 15-20 minutes, stirring halfway so that it bakes evenly.
