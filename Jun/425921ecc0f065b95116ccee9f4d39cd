The circumstances leading to Gunman&#8217;s death were revealed at his funeral after his uncle, Musawenkosi Khanyile, told mourners that his nephew was in an abusive relationship with his wife. Daily Sun reports that, at the funeral service, which took place at the Umthombo Wolazi Multi-Purpose Hall in Dobsonville, family and friends were shocked to hear of the alleged abuse. Gunman&#8217;s body was found hanging in his room at his Soshanguve home by his wife last week. &#8220;He was miserable in his relationship, we&#8217;ve been told. But no one wants to talk about it. The truth needs to be told. Gunman was not happy at all &#8230; When a man is in an abusive relationship, he doesn&#8217;t say anything.&#8221; A relative told mourners that he introduced Gunman to his wife and he regretted that. Sunday World reports, however, that Gunman was so depressed after his side chick passed away last year that he couldn&#8217;t bear to live without her. A source said he had been madly in love with her and he wasn&#8217;t the same after her death. He believed this was the reason Gunman took his own life. Gunman&#8217;s wife told the tabloid he suffered from depression and, because he could not afford to fix his two broken-down cars, he could not attend auditions, further exasperating his mental disorder. On the day of his death, he woke up as usual, opened the gate for her to go to work and, when she returned in the evening, she found a suicide note saying &#8216;sorry&#8217; and Gunman hanging from the burglar bars in their room.
