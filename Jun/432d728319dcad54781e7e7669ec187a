Police Minister Fikile Mbalula and his team on Friday visited old buildings that have been turned into crime havens in the Johannesburg CBD, and urged government to deal with the issue. He spoke to occupants of the buildings, and most of them said they wanted jobs. One of them said people who came from other provinces just brought a blanket and slept in the buildings at night, but were never seen during the day. The Citizen interviewed one of the occupants, Abdul Jamal, in one of the flats, and said it was mostly people who used drugs who were occupants of the buildings. He said the people had been damaged so much it was impossible to advise them on anything. Even if they wanted to follow the advice, they would not be able to follow it, said Jamal. If government made any plans to renovate the buildings, occupants would have to be evicted, but Jamal said it would be impossible to do it without involving religious organisations. &#8220;At least if they can use leaders from the Islamic side and from the Christian side, and they can start slowly by slowly to convince people. &#8220;Because you can see as well if the police and security can try these things, they fight. Because how can you advise a person to calm down if you can&#8217;t use a Bible or Koran. Koran by Islam side, Bible by Christian side.&#8221; If religious leaders could visit the buildings at least twice a week, occupants would understand their role and take their advice. Any other way would just result in violence, he added. &#8220;[When police forcefully evict people], there will be a fight because look, if you&#8217;re someone who has been here for two years, and today someone tells you not to sleep here, just imagine.&#8221; Jamal said he believed the minister when he said the buildings would be fixed for the occupants. &#8220;I do believe the minister because he&#8217;s a man of the government, and as well if you see, the people are suffering. If you can talk about the government, government is the citizen. They choose a member of parliament, and they choose a president for them to be raised well. If the minister can take care of the citizens, everything will be fine. The problem is the issues of sleeping,&#8221; he said. Listen to the full interview below: http://citizen.co.za/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2017/06/AUD-20170623-WA0000.m4a He said: &#8220;Most of the people who use drugs run away from home. It means they are already getting mentalic, physical by mind [sic]. You can&#8217;t advise anything they can do and be able to do it. So for this moment, which situation they can take them, at least if they can use leaders from the Islamic side and from the Christian side, and they can start slowly by slowly to convince people. &#8220;Because you can see as well if the police and security can try this things, they fight. Because how can you advise a person to calm down if you can&#8217;t use a Bible or Koran. Koran by Islam side, Bible by Christian side. &#8220;If you can get leaders from religion to enter twice a week, it will be better. They can understand their role, because the Bible talks the truth and the Koran talks the truth. It talks about Jesus when he came, he came for the people because they were doing wrong. &#8220;[When police forcefully evict people], there will be a fight because look, if you&#8217;re someone who has been here for two years and today someone tells you not to sleep here, just imagine. &#8220;For example, me I come to rent here at your flat, and today you come and tell me: &#8216;Jamal, I need my flat,&#8217; without confirming or to give me any notice for one week or two months, whatever, what do you think is gonna happen? &#8220;Because none of those people are staying at home, they stay here for more than six years now. &#8220;I heard him when he said he will fix it, put electricity and toilets also. I do believe the minister because he&#8217;s a man of the government, and as well if you see the people are suffering. If you can talk about the government, government is the citizen. &#8220;They choose a member of parliament, and they choose a president for them to be raised well. If the minister can take care of the citizens, everything will be fine. The problem is the issues of sleeping.&#8221; Also check out: GALLERY: Mbalula leads police in Joburg CBD raids &nbsp;
