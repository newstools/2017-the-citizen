Antonio Alkana made a career breakthrough on Monday night, shattering the national 110m hurdles record at a European Permit meeting in Prague. The 27-year-old Western Cape athlete won the race in 13.11 seconds, ripping 0.13 off the SA mark of 13.24 held by Lehann Fourie, which had stood for nearly five years. Alkana, who also bettered the African record, took 0.17 off his personal best set in Rabat last season to lead a solid all-round effort by a seven-member SA contingent, with four athletes achieving podium places. Fellow hurdler Wenda Nel also secured victory, setting a season&#8217;s best of 54.66 in the women&#8217;s 400m race over the barriers. Thando Roto finished third in the men&#8217;s 100m sprint, covering the distance in 10.15, and Cornel Fredericks was third in the men&#8217;s 400m hurdles race in 49.42.
