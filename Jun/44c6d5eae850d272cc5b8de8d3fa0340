Luvo Manyonga seems to have sidestepped a major injury scare after the long jump sensation picked up an ankle niggle at the Diamond League meeting in Stockholm on Sunday, less than two months ahead of the World Championships. &#8220;Although he is in slight pain I am confident that it is nothing serious,&#8221; his agent, Lee-Roy Newton, said on Monday.

Though he was well short of his 8.65m world lead, the Olympic silver medallist produced a wind-aided jump of 8.36m, landing seven centimetres clear of second-placed compatriot Ruswahl Samaai to remain unbeaten this season. Following his final attempt, which brought the long jump contest to a close, Manyonga lay in the pit and clutched his left leg in obvious discomfort. As a precaution, his management team confirmed he would go for a scan at the Tuks/HPC later this week, after returning home from a successful European tour.
