Kwaito star and music producer Arthur Mafokate was arrested on charges of assault after allegedly beating up his musician girlfriend, Busisiwe Twala, also known as Cici. Sunday World reported that Mafokate dragged Cici into the street with his car during an argument. According to the police statement, Mafokate received a phone call from another woman while they were in the bedroom on Thursday night. The argument started when Mafokate chose to answer the call outside. Cici said Mafokate refused to disclose who was on the other side of the phone. She said she tried to grab the phone from him, and that is when Mafokate started arguing with her. There have been rumours that the Cici and Mafokate are an time for a long time, but these have not been confirmed until now. Mafokate has a reputation for dating his employees. He has previously dated Chomee, and the mother of his daughter, Queen Sesoko, was a member of Abashante, a kwaito music group founded and managed by Mafokate s recording label, 999.
