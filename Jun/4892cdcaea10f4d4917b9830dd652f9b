Mr. Met&#8217;s big smiling baseball face was back in view on Thursday, but there was a new person behind the mask a day after the New York Mets mascot lost his cool. The Major League Baseball team said the individual performing as Mr. Met on Wednesday &#8211; who was caught raising his white-gloved middle finger to a fan in a video posted on Twitter &#8211; would no longer have the role. Mr. Met has seen enough (via @adelucia35) pic.twitter.com/IVdWKuhctF &mdash; Sports Illustrated (@SInow) June 1, 2017 &#8220;We apologize for the inappropriate action of this employee,&#8221; the team said in a statement. &#8220;We do not condone this type of behavior.&#8221; The Mets said several people share the role of Mr. Met, whose usual duties include dancing to the popular tune &#8220;Take Me Out to the Ballgame&#8221; and firing T-shirts from a cannon to fans in the stands. It wasn&#8217;t clear what led to Wednesday&#8217;s incident, although the man who posted the brief video on Twitter insisted that contrary to some reports he did nothing to provoke Mr. Met. The mini-scandal was at least a distraction from the Mets&#8217; onfield woes, which continued with a 2-1 home loss to the Milwaukee Brewers on Thursday and fell 10 games behind the Washington Nationals in the National League East division. The mascot &#8211; which Mets pitcher Noah Syndergaard has called &#8220;creepy&#8221; &#8211; debuted in April of 1964 as MLB&#8217;s first &#8220;modern live-action mascot,&#8221; according to the team&#8217;s website. It also notes that Mr. Met &#8220;can gesture in 12 different languages.&#8221; This is the second social media mishap the Mets have suffered in the last month.
