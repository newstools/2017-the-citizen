A week ago, Dillyn Leyds and Raymond Rhule were &#8220;special&#8221; teammates at the Springboks. On Saturday, the two wingers are foes again when the Stormers make the trek up to Bloemfontein to face the Cheetahs. Leyds, one of the Capetonians&#8217; more consistent performers in this year&#8217;s Super Rugby campaign, is chilled over the challenge. Also read: Super Rugby: Stormers have a Steven Kitshoff problem But you can&#8217;t help but wonder if he&#8217;s got a point to prove. After all, it was Rhule that restricted him to three appearances as substitute in the series against France. &#8220;I suppose that&#8217;s rugby,&#8221; said Leyds. &#8220;Obviously, when you get to the Springboks you all have a common goal. You back each other and help on and off the field.&#8221; Franchise interests though is a whole different matter. &#8220;We&#8217;re now at our different unions again. We know we&#8217;re going to have a full go at each other,&#8221; said the Stormers winger with a smile. &#8220;That&#8217;s why we play this game and why we love it. That said, it&#8217;s not a one-on-one battle between Raymond and I. There are 14 other opposition players to worry about too.&#8221; Leyds was the only Stormers backline player to feature in the Test series, meaning he worked intimately with the Springboks&#8217; backline coach Franco Smith over the past few weeks. Ironically, Smith is now back masterminding the Cheetahs&#8217; charge. Did Leyds pick up some intelligence on how the central franchise will play at the weekend? &#8220;You pick up the feel that Franco has for the game. I have a better understanding now of how he thinks about the game and how he wants to play,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But it&#8217;s not going to make a big difference. The Cheetahs have some quality players. It&#8217;s one thing knowing what they want to do. It&#8217;s another matter trying to stop them.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter. Would you like to place a rugby bet?
