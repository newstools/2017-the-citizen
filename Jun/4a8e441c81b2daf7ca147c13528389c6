ER24 paramedics arrived on the scene and found the three vehicles all over the scene , ER24 spokesman Russel Meiring said. Four men were found walking around on the scene while three other men were found lying inside their vehicles. Upon closer inspection, paramedics discovered that the three men lying in the vehicles had all sustained numerous, fatal injuries. Unfortunately, nothing could be done for them and they were declared dead on the scene. The four other men were assessed and found to have sustained injuries ranging from minor to critical. Paramedics treated the patients and provided the critically injured [man] with advanced life support interventions.
