In a statement, the Gauteng education department has advised parents to keep their children at home today due to the national taxi strike. &#8220;For the sake of the safety of the children the department believes that all precautionary measures should be taken to keep our children safe. &#8220;The department has urged all schools to give learners that could not make it today a second opportunity to write exams. We understand that many schools are writing exams but assure parents that children that did not go to school today will be given a second opportunity,&#8221; the statement read. Schools were also advised to make a concession for pupils who are writing exams, to allow them to write at a later stage due to the strike.
