The South African Police Service in Limpopo on Sunday again appealed to parents to properly supervise their children, following the arrest of a 14-year-old mother for attempted murder. The teenager was arrested in Bolobedu after a passerby allegedly saw her throw her six-month-old baby boy into a pit toilet and alerted police, Lt-Col Moatshe Ngoepe said. The police reacted swiftly and the child was safely removed from the toilet, still alive, and taken to the hospital for medical treatment immediately. The teenager would appear in the Bolobedu Magistrate s Court on Monday on a charge of attempted murder. The police investigation was continuing. Parents were once again urged to put more effort into child safety, including close supervision, as part of a positive upbringing. Parental education was always vitally important, especially to encourage young girls to refrain from sexual relationships to prevent teenage pregnancies, Ngoepe said. African News Agency (ANA)
