Police from Steenberg in Cape Town acted swiftly while carrying out crime prevention patrols in the area and arrested a man for being in possession of an unlicensed and prohibited firearm and ammunition, Western Cape police said on Saturday. The man was arrested shortly before 9pm on Friday night in St Christopher street, Lavender Hill, Captain FC van Wyk said. Vigilant police officers saw two men riding on a Moto Mia motorcycle. When they saw the police they tried to speed off. Officers gave chase and the suspects lost control of the bike and fell. The driver ran away. The one suspect was caught and upon searching him, members found a Luger M80 parabellum 9mm [pistol], with no serial number, and 13 live rounds of ammunition in his pants. The motorcycle was handed in as an exhibit and the 21-year-old suspect was arrested. Once charged the man would appear in the Wynberg Magistrate s Court for possession of an unlicensed and prohibited firearm and ammunition. The actions of the police members ensured that yet another illegal firearm and ammunition were removed from the community, Van Wyk said.
