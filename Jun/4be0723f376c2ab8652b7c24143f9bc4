An Alex man was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment by the Alex Magistrates Court for two separate house robbery incidents. Philip Sediela, 33, was sentenced after he admitted that, along with others who are at large, he committed a house robbery in Norwood on 22 November last year, Alex News reported. They took several items including TV sets, a safe containing undisclosed items and R1 000 in cash, and drove away in the victim s Toyota Yaris. He was arrested on 1 December last year in Bryanston, where he and two other who are also at large were involved in a shootout with security guards in another house robbery. The gang got into the home by jumping over a fence and forced the homeowner and domestic worker into the house and tied them up. They took a computer, TV set, jewellery, a ring from his finger and cellphones all valued at R100 000. A gardener who witnessed the incident called the guards who, on arrival, returned fire when the robbers shot at them. Two of the perpetrators fled while Sediela was arrested. Most of the stolen items were recovered at the scene, and the vehicle that had been reported as stolen in the Norwood robbery was found next to the home and returned to the owner. &#8211; Caxton News Service For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter
