Even more cracks have started to manifest in what was once the citadel of ANC solidarity, pointing directly to a factionalism within the ruling party that even secretary general Gwede Matashe s call for unity at the recent meeting of the national executive committee cannot paper over. It is no secret that the architect of these schisms is President Jacob Zuma. Zwelinzima Vavi, general secretary of the SA Federation of Trade Unions, a strident Zuma opponent, vented his spleen on Police Minister Fikile Mbalula, saying he should be exhibiting less talk, jive, rhetoric and shiny suits with bow ties, and more action to concentrate on the plight of the worker. Former ANC parliamentarian Vytjie Mentor postulated that the ruling party s national executive committee members cannot be trusted when it comes to removing Zuma, because they are as guilty as he is, and she charged the party s top leadership for allowing Zuma to bring the country to its knees. They were, therefore, complicit for the mess that the country was in. And an internal squabble within the ranks of Umkhonto weSizwe military veterans brewed this week, causing deep divisions in light of recent leadership difficulties. Somehow, we would suggest, that Zuma has simply stopped listening to the people. ALSO READ: Netherworld of scrap metal theft For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
