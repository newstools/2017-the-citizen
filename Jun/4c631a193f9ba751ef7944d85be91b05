A 16-year-old boy was airlifted to hospital after his motorbike and a car collided in Brits on Monday, paramedics said. Paramedics attended to the 16-year old biker who had sustained very serious burns to various parts of his body. Upon realisation of the extent of his injuries and the specific treatment that would be required, the paramedics quickly called for the Netcare 911 helicopter, Netcare 911 spokesperson Nick Dollman said. The specialised air ambulance was dispatched and landed at a nearby hospital. The patient was stabilised at the scene and analgesic medication was administered to control his pain prior to him being airlifted to a specialised Burns Centre in Johannesburg for the urgent attention that he required. He said the crash occurred on a dirt road outside Brits. It was alleged that the bike caught fire following the collision.
