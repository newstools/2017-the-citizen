Water-saving measures were being implemented at all state-owned facilities, Minister of Public Works, Nathi Nhleko said on Thursday. Nhleko said the department s Water Efficiency Strategies for No Drop compliance was being implemented as part of water conservation and water demand management interventions at all state-owned facilities. This followed the completion of water distribution infrastructure assessments. The expenditure of over R42,7 million on blue drop requirements and condition assessments at 64 water treatment works facilities ensured that water of a high quality standard is provided at military bases and to populations accommodated at correctional centres, Nhleko said in a statement on his department s water infrastructure turn-around programme. Nhleko said that 13 of the water treatment works facilities that were previously poorly maintained were located in the Eastern Cape, while others were spread across the Western Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, Free State, Gauteng, Mpumalanga and Limpopo. He said his department spent R55,4 million on projects aimed at meeting green drop requirements at 82 waste water treatment works across the country. A water quality management programme targeting employment for 1,404 young people at 340 facilities was also being rolled out by the department in the current financial year. Civil engineers, artisans (electrical, instrumentation, mechanical &amp; boiler makers) water resource practitioners, compliance managers, senior process controllers, process controllers, maintenance managers, general workers, support staff, laboratory staff and security were being recruited for participation in the programme.
