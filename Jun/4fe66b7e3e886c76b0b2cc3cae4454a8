The Proteas&#8217; deep batting pockets will need to set Sri Lanka a challenging target after they were put in to bat by the Islanders in their opening ICC Champions Trophy match in London. South Africa in the past have preferred to know what their target will be given the bagful of all-rounders &#8211; and batting depth &#8211; they possess. However, they also learned in the series against England that scoreboard pressure batting first can also be a valuable psychological weapon. The Proteas also whitewashed Sri Lanka 5-0 in the ODI series played earlier this year. South Africa have decided to bolster their bowling by including veteran seamer Morne Morkel but certainly won&#8217;t lack batting depth with both Chris Morris and Wayne Parnell playing. Proteas: Quinton de Kock, Hashim Amla, Faf du Plessis, AB de Villiers, JP Duminy, David Miller, Chris Morris, Wayne Parnell, Kagiso Rabada, Morne Morkel, Imran Tahir.
