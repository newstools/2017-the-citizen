The Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leader Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi said he was warned about the violent scenes that have played out in parliament since the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) arrived in the house. Speaking to Power FM this evening, Buthelezi said: &#8220;Mbuyiseni Ndlozi told me that it was going to be rough in parliament. He warned me.&#8221; EFF MPs have, on many occasions been dragged out of the house by parliamentary protection services as they refused to be addressed by President Jacob Zuma. Buthelezi said the decorum of parliament has been destroyed by the EFF. &#8220;Maybe this is the style of the comrades,&#8221; said Buthelezi. EFF leader Julius Malema respond to Buthelezi via a tweet saying :&#8221;And when we respond (to) him. he will be complaining like cry babe.&#8221; On the radio show Buthelezi also talked about being in government under the leadership of former President Nelson Mandela. He served as the Minister of Home Affairs between 1994 and 2004. &#8220;Mandela wanted me to be in his government and he wanted me to be his deputy but I could not agree to giving ANC my votes from the IFP in order to be deputy president,&#8221; he said. He revealed that he acted as the president of the country more than 20 times but some people were &#8216;not happy&#8217; with the arrangement. Buthelezi founded the IFP in 1975 and has been its leader ever since. Asked when he will retire from politics, Buthelezi said he has offered to do so in the past. &#8220;I have offered to resign many times i offered to resign. It can happen any time, I can retire anytime,&#8221; he said. Things got heated Power Fm callers challenged him. Buthelezi told one caller that &#8216;nawe uyabheda&#8217; (you are talking nonsese).
