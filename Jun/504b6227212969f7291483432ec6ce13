It would be easy to dismiss the EFF as paranoid, or attention-seeking, when it claims its leader, Julius Malema, is under surveillance by government officials and the Gupta organisation and that he could be the target of an assassination attempt. Yet, as the country reels under daily revelations about state capture and as we stumble towards an end-of-year ANC conference which will undoubtedly be marked by division, intimidation and even violence, can we afford not to take the EFF and Malema seriously? The leaked Gupta e-mails indicated the family had a spreadsheet detailing the travel movements of a number of prominent bankers, including Absa head Maria Ramos and her husband, former finance minister Trevor Manuel. Malema s movements many of which were never made public were also in that document. All of those whose travels were recorded have one thing in common: they have annoyed the Guptas or Jacob Zuma. Is it really beyond the bounds of possibility that Zuma a Soviet-trained intelligence operative himself is using the country s intelligence machinery to keep track of or plot against his enemies? Remember the clumsy, amateurish attempt to justify the axing of then finance minister Pravin Gordhan on the basis of an intelligence report which claimed he was doing the bidding of foreign masters in trying to depose Zuma? There have also been efforts to follow and monitor journalists who have taken anti-Zuma and anti-Gupta stances in their writing. In at least one instance, this intelligence was used to try to smear an outspoken critic. There is a lot at stake in the ANC succession contest literally billions of rands in backhanders which will flow from government contracts so expect to see more of this as we head towards December. Even more reason why the ANC needs radical political transformation.
