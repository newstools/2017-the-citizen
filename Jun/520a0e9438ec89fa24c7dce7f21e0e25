If Faf du Plessis isn&#8217;t back next week to captain the Proteas in the first Test against England, there need not be panic because his deputy is more than ready. In fact, Dean Elgar can hardly contain himself at the prospect &#8230; and that&#8217;s always a good sign. Also read: Heino Kuhn s big Proteas break is filled with irony &#8220;I&#8217;m very excited,&#8221; he said on Wednesday. &#8220;It has been a dream of mine since I have been a young boy. Even if it doesn t happen at Lord s it s still a great opportunity for me to be a senior leader within the group. I m looking forward to it.&#8221; The Proteas will nonetheless get a taste of his captaincy when he leads them in a three-day warm-up match against the England Lions in Worcester starting Thursday. Known as a fesity player, the left-handed opener has always enjoyed leading from the front, especially when he was captain of a mediocre national U-19 side in 2006. And he&#8217;s not afraid to discuss his philosophy, which certainly suggests he won&#8217;t be a cautious leader. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got to put your pride away,&#8221; said Elgar. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got to think of yourself as someone who&#8217;ll influence a team environment and your teammates. You can&#8217;t focus on yourself. I think it&#8217;s also important not to downplay your leadership qualities, whatever they may be. &#8220;I freely admit that I&#8217;ve always enjoyed the extra responsibility. It&#8217;s a role I want to fulfill.&#8221; The match at the New Road ground is also an important opportunity for Elgar to gel with his new opening partner, Heino Kuhn. But they&#8217;re hardly unfamiliar with each other as they&#8217;re teammates at the Titans too. &#8220;We&#8217;re actually best mates,&#8221; said Elgar. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been that for many years and we&#8217;ve opened together before. I&#8217;m sure our chemistry will be evident immediately.&#8221; Both men have been in outstanding form in the build-up to the series. Elgar has been the top first-class scorer for England county side Somerset (517 runs at an average of 47) while Kuhn recently hit an unbeaten 200 in a South Africa A warm-up and shone with a brilliant 105 in the &#8216;Test&#8217; against the England Lions. &#8220;Heino&#8217;s a highly experienced cricketer. He&#8217;s comfortable with his game. I don&#8217;t need to tell him much,&#8221; said Elgar. For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
