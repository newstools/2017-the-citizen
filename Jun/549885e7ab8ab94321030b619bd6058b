Some decent horses are on display at Turffon tein on Sunday and there are a couple of runners worth looking at. The Johan Janse van Vuuren pair of She s A Giver and Doosra look likely to bounce back to win ning form. She s A Giver was well weighted against the colts last week but could only get involved in the bat tle of the placings when third be hind Daffiq. That clearly suggested her mer it-rating is suspect and the handi cappers were quick to notice that and dropped her a full five points. She is well weighted again in Race 6, a Pinnacle Stakes over 1400m and being fit could prove hard to oppose. This Philanthropist filly was very impressive when winning over the course and distance in November last year. But on Sunday her biggest threat could come from best weighted Wukkin Up or Pool Party. The Sean Tarry-trained Wuk kin Up was a decent third behind Crystal Glamour the last time she raced but is returning from a break. Jockey Gavin Lerena is carded to ride She s A Giver and Doosra and has done well on both mounts. Doosra has not won since beat ing Daffiq In January but could like the drop to 1160m in Race 5, a Pinnacle Stakes. A number of runners in the Grade 3 Jubilee Handicap over 1800m will be trying to qualify for the Vodacom Durban July and it looks a very open contest. The favourite is likely to be Liege from the Sean Tarry yard. However he seems held at the weights so the value may lie with Bankable Teddy. Others with a chance of win ning are Coral Fever, King s Arch er, Moofeed and Hidden Agenda.
