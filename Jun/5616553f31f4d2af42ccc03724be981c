Producer and Mthande hit maker Robbie Malinga is recovering after being admitted to a private hospital in Johannesburg last week. The artist raised a few eyebrows after his performance at the South African Music Awards (Samas) last week, with most commenting on his weight loss. The hit maker had also been touring with Idols SA winner Musa performing fan favourite Mthande. Speaking to Sunday Sun, Universal Music spokesperson Dharam Sewraj said Malinga had been diagnosed with anaemia, a deficiency of iron in his blood. Sewraj further told the publication Malinga was &#8220;recovering very well&#8221; since being admitted on Thursday. He would be released &#8220;soon&#8221;, as doctors were keeping a close eye on him, he added. His fans should not panic, but should pray for his speedy recovery. You must remember that Robbie is always on the road. And as a label, we re going to encourage him to rest from now on. &#8220;He has just completed working on his album, and we believe it s time for him to take some time off to rest, Sewraj was quoted as saying by the publication.
