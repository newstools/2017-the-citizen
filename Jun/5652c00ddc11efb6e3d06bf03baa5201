Joyous Celebration boss Lindelani Mkhize has claimed a well-known businessman had defrauded him of R2.9 million. Mkhize claimed he signed a lease agreement in 2012 with Vukile Property Fund Limited and Flavours of Life Franchising CC at the Grosvenor Shopping Centre in Bryanston to do business, only to discovered later one of the businessmen had given him fake documents. The businessman had claimed the documents were from the landlord, when, in fact, the place belonged to someone else. Mkhize only discovered this the following year after his R2.9 million was stolen and the place owned by other people, Sunday Sun reported. Mkhize told the publication he had opened a case, though he could not name the perpetrator, as the matter was still being investigated. He further said he was not the only one to have been defrauded in the deal. He said he had not recovered his millions, and would consider taking legal action after getting feedback from the cops. Police spokesperson Ramothakhi Maqabe confirmed to the publication that a case of fraud had been opened at Edenvale Police Station, but said no arrests had been made. Vukile Property Fund reportedly distanced itself from the claims, as they were &#8220;just the landlords&#8221;. Flavours of Life Franchising CC could not be reached for comment. &nbsp;
