The Democratic Alliance said on Thursday that they were horrified at the reported rape of an 18-year-old woman at the Lenasia South Clinic. In a statement, DA spokesperson for health Jack Bloom said according to the police, the 18-year-old went to the toilet while visiting the clinic on Wednesday, and was raped there by an unknown man, who then ran away. A full investigation is needed into this terrible incident which highlights criminality that has no boundaries whatsoever in perpetrating a heinous deed in a place of healing, he said. There have been other rapes in hospitals but usually at night or over a weekend. Bloom said they needed to know how a security lapse occurred at this clinic, which was guarded by a security company that is paid more than R6 million a year. The security cameras should assist in identifying the perpetrator. I hope that the police apprehend the rapist as soon as possible.
