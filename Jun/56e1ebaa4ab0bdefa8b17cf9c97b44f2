18:58 It&#8217;s a series win for the Springboks! They win 37-15, delivering a performance brimming with excellent defence, soaking up pressure and taking their attacking chances. 18:57 I could not be happier for anyone else getting their first test try than @jantjies_elton. Richly deserved. Owes @kolisi1 a beer or six. &mdash; Sibusiso Mjikeliso (@Sbu_Mjikeliso) June 17, 2017 18:56 SPRINGBOKS 37 &#8211; FRANCE 15 (Try Elton Jantjies) Siya Kolisi caps off a magnificent performance by intercepting at halfway and gifting a scoring pass to Elton Jantjies. 18:50 https://t.co/PHzKdzDmpn &mdash; Bryan Habana (@BryanHabana) June 17, 2017 18:47 SPRINGBOKS 30 &#8211; FRANCE 15 (Try Damien Penaud) The French strike back after they contest the kick-off. Some wonderful, delayed passing sees debutant Damien Penaud dot down. 18:45 SPRINGBOKS 30 &#8211; FRANCE 10 (Try Coenie Oosthuizen) The Springboks turn over possession and patiently build after Jantjies makes good ground. Pieter-Steph du Toit&#8217;s beautifully timed pass to Coenie Oosthuizen proves irresistible, especially given the replacement prop&#8217;s superb running line. 18:43 A SuperSport United stalwart is enjoying things. So many experts of the game when sitting slumped on a couch!! &mdash; Jeremy Brockie (@JRBrockie) June 17, 2017 18:40 SPRINGBOKS 23 &#8211; FRANCE 10 (Penalty Francois Trinh-Duc) Finally, France are rewarded for all their attacking endeavour after Franco Mostert goes off-side at a ruck. But it still feels like a win for the Springboks in that passage of play. 18:33 France finally go wide as Damien Penaud aims for the left-hand touchline but some brilliant cover defence by Ross Cronje undermines him. Still 23-7 after 58 minutes. 18:29 Outstanding tackling by the Springboks. The Springboks have made more tackles in the last 13 minutes than they did in the whole of 2016. #SAvFRA &mdash; Jean Smyth (@JeanSmyth) June 17, 2017 18:27 The fan club expands by the minute. Kolisi Kolisi Kolisi @kolisi1 &mdash; Akani Simbine (@AkaniSimbine) June 17, 2017 18:22 Superb defence by the Springboks. France manage to do do pretty much nothing after 25 phases. 18:18 Difficult not to see that connection. Boks need to put 50 on this French team. Since Picamole left field the french have no Vooma in their forward pack. They also tiring aswell &mdash; ThandoManana (@TandoManana) June 17, 2017 18:08 @kolisi1 great first 40.. Looking forward to the show in the second half &mdash; Vuyo Zangqa (@vuyozangqa) June 17, 2017 18:03 #SAvFRA &#8211; HT: South Africa 23-7 France SA scored two tries, including this excellent intercept by Kolisi, to enjoy a strong lead. pic.twitter.com/tkuAb1RfQJ &mdash; SuperSport (@SuperSportTV) June 17, 2017 18:02 A scrum lesson from a former Springbok captain. France have paid the price to date. Tight head loses his rights if he binds on loose heads arm, ref needs to fix otherwise scrums will continue to frustrate sadly &mdash; John Smit (@JohnSmit123) June 17, 2017 18:00 HALFTIME: SPRINGBOKS 23 &#8211; FRANCE 7 The hosts came back superbly in the second quarter. They&#8217;re on their way to a series win! But it&#8217;s not over yet. 17:57 SPRINGBOKS 23 &#8211; FRANCE 7 (Penalty Elton Jantjies) Raman Slimani gets punished in the scrum. And the lead is extended. 17:52 @kolisi1 my Captain assist and try this first half&#8230; Siya Coutinho &mdash; Wayde van Niekerk (@WaydeDreamer) June 17, 2017 17:50 SPRINGBOKS 20 &#8211; FRANCE 7 (Penalty Elton Jantjies) France are under the cosh now. They defend a maul illegally and Jantjies pops the penalty over. 17:46 SPRINGBOKS 17 &#8211; FRANCE 7 (Try Siya Kolisi) Jan Serfontein rescues a stray pass by Skosan with a smart kick. He then follows up brilliantly with a superb tackle and the pass ends up in Kolisi&#8217;s hands. Deserved that score. 17:45 Check out the Serfontein try. Beautiful work by the @Springboks as Jan Serfontein finishes off for the hosts first try. Now LIVE on SS1. pic.twitter.com/QwLemqWl2T &mdash; SuperSport (@SuperSportTV) June 17, 2017 17:42 Siya Kolisi has been a hit in the No 6 jersey. Very impressive start by Kolisi. Two great linking assists, one leading to try. Say it again &#8230; like him at 6! &mdash; Rob Houwing (@RobHouwing) June 17, 2017 17:39 SPRINGBOKS 10 &#8211; FRANCE 7 (Try Jan Serfontein) Elton Jantjies changes the angle and finds Jan Serfontein, who gets support from centre partner Lionel Mapoe, but it&#8217;s the brilliant off-load by Courtnall Skosan and the perfectly timed pass by Siya Kolisi that opens it up for Serfontein. Superb try. 17:35 Slimani wins one as France get a penalty. What a contest between @Beast_TM vs @slimrab89 !! Gonna be an interesting day at scrum time ! Any thoughts ? &mdash; Gurthro Steenkamp (@gurthro) June 17, 2017 17:32 Poor man Oupa&#39;s gona feel that in the morning. &mdash; Kaptein Kortbroek (@tune_jou_once) June 17, 2017 17:29 Oupa Mohoje seems to have sustained concussion after a clash on defence. Jean-Luc du Preez comes on. 17:24 Excellent set move from the line-out as the inside pass goes to Raymond Rhule. He breaks and finds Oupa Mohoje, who straightens well. But Ross Cronje can&#8217;t find any of the three runners waiting for the ball. Cronje loses communication with the backline. Thank you MTN &mdash; Peter de Villiers (@Coachdivvy) June 17, 2017 &nbsp; 17:19 SPRINGBOKS 3 &#8211; FRANCE 7 (Penalty Elton Jantjies) Avoidable penalty by the French, who go off-side in midfield. Jantjies on the money. 17:18 Brilliant scoring pass by the Fiji-born wing. Welcome, France. Vakatawa&#8230;bang bang. #SAvFRA &mdash; Jean Smyth (@JeanSmyth) June 17, 2017 17:13 SPRINGBOKS 0 &#8211; FRANCE 7 (Try Scott Spedding) The Springboks slack off at a breakdown and cough up posession. The midfielders provide thrust before some brilliant handling down the left side sees former South African Scott Spedding dot down in the corner. Fine start by the tourists. 17:09 Couldn&#8217;t agree more. Dude&#8230;love that drumming in the background of the anthem. Killer version at Kings Park. Well done to all those folks. &mdash; stuart hess (@shockerhess) June 17, 2017 17:08 The Drakensberg Boys Choir are singing the national anthems today. Really nice and refreshing. 17:06 There are quite a few empty seats. Durban? Where are you? There is a @Springboks Test on today. &mdash; Kevin McCallum (@KevinMcCallum) June 17, 2017 16:59 He didn&#8217;t do all that badly with his dodgy cut too! Great news guys. Jantjies got his hair cut yesterday. It&#39;s gonna be a good game for him! #JantjiesHair &mdash; Peter de Villiers (@Coachdivvy) June 17, 2017 16:57 Have just boarded a plane to Jhb, don&#39;t know if it is a curse or blessing wrt the Springboks, game will be finished when I land, let me know &mdash; Schalk Burger (@skalabrak) June 17, 2017 16:49 We can confirm this. Once you&#8217;ve sat down, you&#8217;re not moving. Kings Park still one of my favourite rugby grounds. Press box a squeeze but you get a clear view of the live action #SAvFRA pic.twitter.com/lrlf0f1ixu &mdash; Jon Cardinelli (@jon_cardinelli) June 17, 2017 16:47 We are only a few minutes away from kickoff in Durban. Former @Springboks captain Jean de Villiers gave us his thoughts before todays&#39; test. pic.twitter.com/kpLoQX6BXx &mdash; SuperSport (@SuperSportTV) June 17, 2017 16:32 The Springboks team: Andries Coetzee, Raymond Rhule, Lionel Mapoe, Jan Serfontein, Courtnall Skosan, Elton Jantjies, Ross Cronje, Warren Whiteley, Oupa Mohoje, Siya Kolisi, Franco Mostert, Eben Etzebeth, Frans Malherbe, Malcolm Marx, Beats Mtawarira. Bench: Bongi Mbonambi, Steven Kitshoff, Coenie Oosthuizen, Pieter-Steph du Toit, Jean-Luc du Preez, Francois Hougaard, Frans Steyn, Dillyn Leyds. 16:31 The calm before the storm. #springboks #france #durban https://t.co/UdwCjKfDXs &mdash; Brenden Nel (@BrendenNel) June 17, 2017 16:28 Frans Steyn isn&#8217;t having much of a problem knocking over those long range penalties. Lengte is nie een van Frans Steyn se probleme nie. pic.twitter.com/K0vjJRPQm8 &mdash; Hendrik Cronj (@hendrikcronje71) June 17, 2017 16:26 Both teams out on the Kings Park pitch. Beautiful conditions here. Was 25 degrees Celsius earlier, will cool down before kickoff #SAvFRA pic.twitter.com/g68Y1C1Z2O &mdash; SA Rugby magazine (@SARugbymag) June 17, 2017 16:22 He also talks a bit about the way the Springboks should play: &#8220;I think the Springboks played the type of game that people were pleased to see. There was variety and balance. They still created a lot of opportunities and will hope to take them better.&#8221; 16:20 Former Springboks skipper Jean de Villiers believes the hosts will be even better this week: &#8220;They&#8217;ll be keen. They&#8217;ve set themselves a marker after last week and will want to improve further. The confidence is there.&#8221; 16:16 Warren Whiteley carries a lot of burdens at the moment. He&#8217;s the face of the &#8220;new&#8221; Springboks. He also doesn&#8217;t mind being skipper of the national side as well as the Lions. But just don&#8217;t try to compare his responsibilities with each other. Read more here. 16:11 A decade ago, Scott Spedding was playing for the Sharks. Now he&#8217;s a French international. Welcome back to Kings Park, @Scott_Spedding It has been a while!:) @FFRugby pic.twitter.com/BQv4JiqKDz &mdash; South African Rugby (@Springboks) June 17, 2017 16:00 The Springboks have been addressed by sports minister Thulas Nxesi.

Sport &amp; Rec (@SPORTandREC_RSA) June 17, 2017 15:45 Hooker Malcolm Marx was named Man-of-the-Match at Loftus last week. Read here what he&#8217;s been doing right. 15:33 Preferably, uhm, everyone? Last weekend we saw massive performances from @M_marxi2 and @EbenEtzebeth at Loftus Versfeld. Who do you want to see at his best today? pic.twitter.com/oZfzrMDhzk &mdash; South African Rugby (@Springboks) June 17, 2017 15:31 This tweet (&#8220;Tears or joy?&#8221;) is actually more significant than you think. The Springboks have lost their last two Tests at Kings Park &#8211; a traumatic 25-37 first loss to Argentina in 2015 and last year&#8217;s 15-57 nightmare at the hands of the All Blacks. Vreugde of trane? pic.twitter.com/gt52eiasvE &mdash; Hendrik Cronj (@hendrikcronje71) June 17, 2017 15:30 So, was last week&#8217;s good performance at Loftus a fluke or have the Springboks actually embarked on a new journey?
