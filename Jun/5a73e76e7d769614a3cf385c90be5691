AB de Villiers insists he has nothing to prove ahead of the Proteas&#8217; T20 series against England starting on Wednesday evening. The dynamic middle-order batter will be captaining the side in the absence of Faf du Plessis. And, to place even more of a burden on him, he&#8217;s also tasked with providing runs in an inexperienced batting order. Also read: Why the Proteas meaningless T20 series matters &#8220;I&#8217;m not concerned about my form,&#8221; said De Villiers ahead of the opening battle in Southampton. &#8220;Look, you want to score hundreds and win games for your country as much as you can. I haven&#8217;t done that in my last few games. I don&#8217;t need to prove anything to anyone but I need runs. There&#8217;s nothing more rewarding than scoring runs.&#8221; The 33-year-old only scored 20 runs in 3 Champions Trophy innings and predictably copped much of the flak for South Africa&#8217;s failed campaign. But it&#8217;s not something that&#8217;s going to weigh De Villiers down. &#8220;It&#8217;s much easier now, the first few days were really tough listening to some of the criticism, which I didn&#8217;t take too personally,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You sometimes listen to it and take the positives out of it and move forward.&#8221; Following criticism from two former Proteas &#8211; Ashwell Prince and Herschelle Gibbs &#8211; over what they perceive to be nit-picking on his part, De Villiers maintains he&#8217;s not dictating when he wants to play international cricket. Both pundits believe Cricket South Africa (CSA) is giving De Villiers free reign on the matter. &#8220;It&#8217;s important for me to be fresh physically and mentally moving forward,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll re-asses with CSA when I get back. I&#8217;ve mentioned this many times now, my focus is on the 2019 World Cup. Not all of it, there&#8217;s a lot of cricket to be played. I have a great responsibility on my shoulders leading the one-day side in other games. I want to give my best but I need to be strong and fit to do that.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
