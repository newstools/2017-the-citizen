It seems the Social Media Blackout campaigners&#8217; plea has not fallen on deaf ears, as Vodacom on Thursday took to social media to respond. The Social Media Blackout protest on Wednesday called on South Africans to switch off social media accounts for the day and to refrain from buying data to force network providers to lower their data rates. It will apparently be done every Wednesday. But it seems the protest might not last long, as Vodacom has, in a series of tweets, responded to the protesters&#8217; plea using the hashtag, #WatchThisSpace. &#8220;We know you out here fam, and we are listening,&#8221; said Vodacom, adding that &#8220;something big&#8221; was coming. Vodacom has encouraged social media users to keep an eye on their timelines, as &#8220;this is news you are going to want to share&#8221;. &#8220;#WatchThisSpace fam, we ve got some exciting news coming your way,&#8221; it said, news that will apparently &#8220;change the game&#8221;. When the news breaks, South Africans will apparently have &#8220;megs&#8221; of reasons to enjoy social media even more. &#8220;We are going to give you the chance to level up your social game. #WatchThisSpace.&#8221; For now, people can use Facebook for free on Vodacom, it said, responding to a user who asked which social networks were free. Hi fam, you can enjoy Facebook for free on our network. &mdash; Vodacom (@Vodacom) June 21, 2017 While some users were excited at the news, some said they would wait for the big announcement rather than celebrate now, only to be disappointed.
