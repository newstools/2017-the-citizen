Limpopo police commissioner Lt-Gen Nneke Ledwaba has condemned the apparent continuous acts of vigilantism by some community members in the province who are still attacking and killing suspected criminals. Ledwaba warned members of the community to stop this tendency immediately; otherwise they will meet the long arm of the law and no stone will be left unturned in this matter until all the people involved are arrested . We are also calling upon all our communities to assist the police by providing valuable information that can lead to the arrest of these criminals, Ledwaba said. This followed yet another incident, in Mahwelereng at Mokopane, in which a 24-year-old man was attacked, stoned, and burnt to death by a group of community members in Tshamahanzi village in the early hours of Saturday morning, Lt-Col Moatshe Ngoepe said. It was alleged that a 37-year-old man from Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga was at Tshamahanzi village to attend a night vigil before the funeral of one of his relatives. He later walked around the village and became involved in an argument with a 24-year-old man. The argument continued until the man from Bushbuckridge was stabbed to death with a sharp instrument by the 24-year-old man. Subsequently, members of the community mobilised at about 3am and started attacking the suspect with stones and set him alight in retaliation to the killing of the 37-year-old visitor . The mob-justice victim was a resident of Tshamahansi village and police preliminary investigations had revealed that he was previously arrested for burglary and robbery cases. The suspects in the mob-killing are still unknown and there is no arrest, Ngoepe said. Anyone with any information about the matter was asked to contact Colonel Moshapati Sekanka on 082-565-8505, or the nearest police station or the crime stop number 08600-10111 or the crime line sms 32211.
