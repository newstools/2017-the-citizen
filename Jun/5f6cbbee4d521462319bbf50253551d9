Here at The Citizen Sport, we&#8217;re trying to offer a unique and alternative product. We don&#8217;t want to focus on the regular stuff but rather give you interesting content that focuses on the personalities and issues of your favourite sport. Because of our positioning, we don&#8217;t concentrate on flooding our sport homepage with every sporting story that comes through on a given day. We rather want differentiate ourselves as your one-stop for interesting and compelling content. But we&#8217;re constantly trying to improve your experience and, as a result, we&#8217;ve come up with a simple way catering for breaking sporting news that doesn&#8217;t require a full story. Scroll down to our Twitter stream on the right-hand side of the screen, which is the tool we&#8217;ll use for up to the minute sporting news bits. We hope it adds to our overall product without detracting from what we want to stand for. Happy reading! For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
