For the last decade Ugandans have known two presidents: Yoweri Museveni, the country s long-time ruler, and musician Robert Kyagulanyi a.k.a. Bobi Wine, a.k.a. His Excellency the Ghetto President. But in a surprising turn the 35-year-old reggae star &#8212; who was just three when Museveni took power at the head of a rebel army &#8212; on Thursday won a landslide victory in a city by-election to become the country s newest lawmaker. Wine is a spectacularly popular Ugandan entertainer. For many, he embodies the struggles, frustrations and hopes of the young, poor and marginalised in a youthful nation whose often elderly rulers can seem dismissive of their plight. The by-election in the teeming capital Kampala was called due to voting irregularities during last year s general election. Standing as an independent, Wine defeated established candidates from both Museveni s ruling NRM and the main opposition FDC parties. His election marks a remarkable personal journey for the charismatic reggae star from brash, dreadlock-wearing, slum-dwelling youth to a sharp-suited and savvy political operator. Wine rose to prominence about a decade ago with catchy, upbeat tunes in African reggae style with lyrics that often touched on issues of poverty and social justice. Growing up in Kamwokya, one of Kampala s poorest slums, Wine worked as a backing singer before making it to university where he studied music and drama before launching his solo career. The party-loving popster grew dreads and dubbed the swampy slum of his youth Uganja&#8217;. He could be seen cruising the capital in his ostentatious Cadillac Escalade, a marijuana leaf symbol adorning the personalised numberplate. &#8211; He understands our situation &#8211; ================================== Wine quickly became a tabloid sensation, his love life a source of endless, lurid speculation, and his somewhat trumped-up beefs with fellow musicians Jose Chameleon and Bebe Cool a mainstay of the gossip columns. But Wine gradually removed himself from such frivolity, styling himself a champion of ordinary Ugandans and a crusader against the social status quo. When other Ugandan stars took money to sing for Museveni s 2016 election campaign, Wine refused the cash and withstood the pressure. Instead he released a song Dembe (meaning Freedom in the local Luganda language) calling for non-violence in a country where elections are a time of teargas, gunfire and heavy-handed police. On Friday morning, after his by-election win, Dembe blasted from the speakers of a bootleg DVD shack in Kamwokya market, about 10 kilometres (six miles) from Bobi s new constituency, Kyadondo East. People thronged the dank, narrow alleyways where corrugated iron sheets shut out most of the strong sunlight while, under-foot, rotting hessian sacks were laid over slime-covered pathways. Bobi grew up here, he s been on the ground and understands our situation, said Hamidu Mubiru, a market trader. I feel as if I know him somehow and I appreciate the things he has done for us. He s been singing about the dictatorship and their brutality, says the 27-year old, describing Museveni s rule in terms that, as a shrewd public figure, Wine would be unlikely to claim. But as the singer makes his move from Ghetto President to real-life MP he will have to work hard not to disappoint the impoverished, urban youth who look to him for hope and change.
