Three suspected burglars were arrested following a high-speed car chase in Cape Town s southern suburbs on Wednesday afternoon, Western Cape police said. Police spokesman Andre Traut said just after midday members of the Western Cape Flying Squad noticed a vehicle travelling at high speed jump a red traffic light, prompting officers to give chase. The registration number of the vehicle was tested which revealed that the vehicle had been stolen in Somerset West, said Traut. In an attempt to evade arrest, the driver drove at an excessive speed and collided with another vehicle in Klipper Road Rondebosch, and finally came to a stop in Main Road. Police arrested the occupants of the car, aged 25, 26, and 31. A search of the vehicle turned up several household items and jewellery stolen during a burglary in Fish Hoek earlier on Wednesday. A crowbar was also found in their possession. The suspects were expected in court once they had been charged
