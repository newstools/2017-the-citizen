President Jacob Zuma has denied that his son Duduzane Zuma has an unfair advantage because the president does his bidding. In a Q&amp;A session that, owing to the absence of EFF members, saw the DA firing most of the questions, DA leader Mmusi Maimane told Zuma &#8220;the only young person who has benefited from your government is your own son, Duduzane&#8221;. Maimane quoted from the alleged #GuptaEmails request from Zuma that Duduzane is my only son who deals with money, please help him , and told Zuma he was speaking on behalf of the other &#8216;Duduzanes&#8217; who are overlooked because they are not politically connected. Telling Maimane that &#8220;unemployment has been growing all over the world&#8221; and therefore not unique to South Africa, Zuma told the DA leader that if he had never met other successful young South Africans, then he was an &#8220;unfortunate leader&#8221;. Zuma told Maimane he was isolating Duduzane purely because he happened to be his child. &#8220;He is involved in business on his own accord. He started by working and later became a businessperson. Because he is a son of a president there is no law that says he can t go in business. &#8220;Unemployment was not created by Duduzane going into business. There are very many young people who are benefiting from this government. You are just being funny to a young man who has gone to school and he is now in business,&#8221; Zuma told the National Assembly.
