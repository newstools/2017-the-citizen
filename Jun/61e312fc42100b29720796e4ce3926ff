Singer Kelly Khumalo&#8217;s alleged new lover, Sjula Dlamini, was reportedly booted out of SABC1 music show Live Amp over bribery claims. Dlamini, Live Amp&#8217;s producer and voice-over artist for Date My Family, was suspended after several artists complained he had demanded money from them in order to play their songs on the show, Sunday Sun has reported. The producer, however, said though he was aware of the allegations against him, he had not been suspended but left the show for &#8220;greener pastures&#8221;. He told the publication he knew about someone who was using his name to ask people to pay him to play their music. The said person apparently even offered presenter positions on Live Amp. In fact, it should be some artists under fire and not him, as they had tried to offer him money to play their music, though he would not name them. Urban Brew communication specialist Marvin Cohen could neither confirm nor deny Dlamini&#8217;s suspension, but only said he had moved to another production.
