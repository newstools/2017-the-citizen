Nelson Mandela Bay Fire Chief, Andre de Ridder said that five out of the six fires across the Bay were not under control. De Ridder listed the following vegetation fires in the Nelson Mandela Bay area. -Victoria Drive near Schoenmakerskop -Welcome Avenue in Theescombe -Elands River near Rocklands -Sardinia Bay Road -Bushbucks Ridge -Van Stadens Gorge De Ridder said that out of all the fires, the blaze in Theescombe was the only fire under control by Thursday late afternoon. Metro spokesperson, Mthubanzi Mniki, said that the vegetation fires had increased since Wednesday night and informal dwellings had been destroyed near the Van Stadens Gorge. For now, only four informal dwellings have been destroyed at Van Stadens Gorge. No injuries have been reported so far. The increased wind speed is posing a challenge for the fire fighting teams, however they are doing their best to limit injury to people, animals and property, said Mniki. According to the SA Weather Service, wind speed is expected to decrease during the course of Thursday making it more conducive for fire fighting teams working across the Bay battling the blaze.
