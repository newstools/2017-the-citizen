Gospel musician and producer Ntumisang Makweya, known by his fans as Dr Tumi, has announced that he has signed a &#8220;huge&#8221; international distribution partnership with Universal Music South Africa. The two parties have been negotiating the deal for a few months, with Dr Tumi explaining they had to come to an agreement that suited both parties. The deal will take his music to nations across the world and see the musician collaborating with other international musicians. The multi-award winning artist, who has been in the music scene for some time, said it was time for his music to move beyond the country and continent, further describing the deal as a dream come true. &#8220;When I started off, the idea was to get into the South African market, and once I&#8217;ve done that, go beyond that. It was about time to start talking about international deals and going outside the country. I&#8217;m really honoured, this is my first international deal, and to take the music beyond South African borders has been a dream to me. I&#8217;m very excited about it, we&#8217;re working hard to get the music off the ground,&#8221; he said. Universal Music SA said it was &#8220;honoured&#8221; to be partnering with the soon-to-be &#8220;one of the top-selling African gospel artists in the world&#8221;. &#8220;We are honoured that we have sealed a deal with Dr Tumi, an amazing, blessed, anointed and talented man of God. As you know Dr Tumi is one of the top-selling artists in Africa, soon to be one of the top-selling African gospel artists in the world. For us as Universal, to be partnering with him and to be trusted by him to help carry his brand and his music to the rest of the continent and the world is an honour.&#8221; Dr Tumi has released his single, Everything, featuring Benjamin Dube, Ntokozo and Nqubeko Mbatha, Mahalia Buchanan, Khaya Mthethwa, Lebo Sekgobela and gospel duo Taki and Rofhiwa. He will also go on an international tour, starting with filling up the Ticket Pro-Dome with a live DVD recording on August 20. The tickets will be on sale starting from next week.
