Following allegations that Arthur Mafokate had physically abused his rumoured girlfriend, Busisiwe Twala, popularly known as Cici, his ex-girlfriend Chomee has come out in his defence. Chomee told Sunday Sun that the allegations painted a tainted picture of Mafokate, saying he was not that kind of a man. The artist said she had known Mafokate since she was 10 and that he was anything but a &#8220;woman basher&#8221;. &#8220;In fact, it&#8217;s news to me that he&#8217;s capable of lifting a hand to a woman,&#8221; she was quoted as saying. Chomee said though she was all for women&#8217;s rights, all she was asking was for people to wait for the courts to rule on the matter as everyone was &#8220;innocent until proven guilty&#8221;. She further criticised senior politicians such as EFF leader Julius Malema for &#8220;attacking&#8221; Mafokate based on allegations. Chomee said people should be aware of how &#8220;dirty&#8221; showbiz is, saying she was offered &#8220;goodies&#8221; to bad-mouth Mafokate when the two split. &#8220;But when all is said and done, Arthur is a very sweet man and a good father to his daughters,&#8221; she added. Mafokate said he would revela all the &#8220;explosive?&#8221; details in court and clear his name. &#8220;I&#8217;m not taking this lying down,&#8221; he reportedly told the publication. Last week, Cici opened a case of assault against Mafokate, who she called my boyfriend in a police statement. Mafokate allegedly dragged her on the street with his car during an argument after receiving a phone call from another woman while they were in the bedroom on Thursday evening, reported Sunday World. Mafokate reportedly answered the call outside, leaving Cici suspecting he was talking to a nyatsi. After hearing a giggle from Mafokate, Cici then asked him who he was speaking to, but he refused to reveal the identity of the woman who was making him giggle. An argument then started after she tried to grab the phone from him. Mafokate then went outside and got into his car while cursing and telling her not to argue with him in the presence of his children. She went after him and pleaded with him to open the door of the car, but Mafokate refused and allegedly drove off while she was still holding the handle. She was reportedly admitted to Waterfall Hospital in Midrand for the injuries she sustained during the incident. Mafokate was subsequently arrested, but reportedly opened a countercharge against Cici. Police told the publication Mafokate claimed Cici assaulted him with chairs and tables while they were wrestling for his phone. He further said he was not aware she was still holding on to the car when he drove off in an attempt to avoid the escalation of the fight. Mafokate appeared at the Midrand Magistrates Court on Friday for common assault and was released on R500 bail. The case was adjourned indefinitely for further investigation. Following the reports, EFF leader Julius Malema has questioned the ANC Women s League s silence on the matter. Also read: Cici shares disturbing picture of scar, with hashtag #BreakTheSilence
