The minister of public enterprises has told the media it took her relatively longer than she would ordinarily have to approve the appointment of an acting Eskom CEO because she was cautious. In confirming Johnny Dladla, a veteran of Eskom management who previously headed a subsidiary of the company called Eskom enterprises, Minister Brown told the media this was the beginning of restoring confidence and inculcating of a culture of impeccable corporate governance. Brown told the media at a press conference this afternoon that she &#8220;couldn t work with four members&#8221; and the additional four members would be taken to Cabinet for approval next month. Zethembe Khosa retains his position as the acting chairperson, with Manoj Singh, currently Eskom&#8217;s CFO, will be joined by Dladla as executive directors on the board. The minister delegated the nine-member board to fill vacancies within the board governance structures in line with Companies Act requirements.

Mr Gouden I actually brought in because he is a CA with financial management experience and was in the internal auditing team of SARS,&#8221; she said. Brown also said that she was hopeful the labour court would declare Brian Molefe&#8217;s re-appointment as CEO &#8220;null and void&#8221;. Opening the door for Dladla to apply for the position if he so wishes, Brown said he will have to go through a process like the rest of the candidates before a decision is made. She said Eskom would be re-advertising the position once the court challenge brought by Molefe was concluded and that if Koko [Matshela, suspended acting CE] comes back it will be to his executive position. Prior to his short-lived stint as acting CEO, Koko was group executive of power generation. Brown dismissed speculation that she had a row with former chairperson Dr Ben Ngubane. &#8220;Dr Ngubane just said the reason he is resigning is personal reasons. Did I have an argument with him? I come from the Cape, sometimes I sound like I am having an argument but I am just gentle and sweet.&#8221; Answering a question on the validity of claims made by Ngubane that Treasury unduly interfered in the running of Eskom, Brown said the PFMA regulation section 51(g) &#8220;gives Treasury the right to examine its application&#8221; and &#8220;it [PFMA] gives me the right in terms of section 54 to do the same.&#8221; Molefe set to make first public appearance as reinstated Eskom CEO For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter
