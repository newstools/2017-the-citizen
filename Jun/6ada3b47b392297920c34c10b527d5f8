The Bulls delivered a big blow to the Sharks&#8217; mental state in the run-up to the Super Rugby playoff with a surprise but excellent 30-17 win at Kings Park on Friday night. Working from a good platform up front and capitalising on the counterattack, the men from Pretoria suggested there might yet be a promise of better days under John Mitchell in the future. That said, they were also helped by a Sharks side that will be kicking themselves for this poor performance. Who was the star in this match? Warrick Gelant gained most of the plaudits for his brilliant attacking performance but the catalyst for this win was Jan Serfontein. The Springbok midfielder continued his outstanding form and delivered a positively dreamy, varied performance. He ran 65m, set up two of Gelant&#8217;s tries, completed 11 tackles and won three turnovers. World class. Key themes and moments Despite the Bulls showing the type of attacking intent they&#8217;ve been striving for, it wasn&#8217;t necessarily the foundation of their win. In fact, it was 2017&#8217;s chronic weakness &#8211; defence &#8211; that was decisive. In an open game, some gaps popped up but it shouldn&#8217;t detract from an improved tackling performance. The Bulls made 114 tackles and completed them at an excellent 90%. After an iffy start, the Bulls&#8217; forwards also showed their mettle. They won all five of their scrums and eventually also secured their line-outs well too. It was also noticeable how their bossed the breakdowns, illustrating again that attacking rugby can&#8217;t be played if there isn&#8217;t a platform up front. In contrast, the Sharks were wayward and hampered by poor decision-making. There were some neat touches on the attack but numerous times those movements broke down due to errors. However, what will irritate coach Robert du Preez even more is that the Durbanites played away from their strengths this season. There was little evidence of their excellent defensive system and no patient build-ups to their attacks. The Sharks&#8217; discipline was at times shocking, which also led to winger Sbu Nkosi&#8217;s sin binning for taking a man out in the air. Curwin Bosch&#8217;s try initially threatened to render that irrelevant as the home side narrowed the gap to 17-20. But Serfontein&#8217;s immediate response &#8211; a nifty break and a wonderful overhead pass for Gelant&#8217;s hat-trick &#8211; secured the Bulls&#8217; win.
