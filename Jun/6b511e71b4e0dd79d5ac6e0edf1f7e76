In an interview with Gareth Cliff on online station Cliff Central, Bob Mabena revealed some surprising details about his parents&#8217; relationship. Mabena told Cliff how he had found out that his dad was much younger than his mom. When his mom died, he calculated his parents&#8217; ages and discovered that his father was a Ben 10 . &#8220;I did the numbers and I found out that my father was a Ben 10 and it kind of made sense why the relationship was so volatile. It was really one of those Mr and Mrs Smith relationships,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They hated to love each other, and I think she (mom) was really miffed at the fact that she really liked this young guy and he had this bravado thing, this macho thing that he could bed an older woman than him, who had gone further in school than he had,&#8221; he said.
