If there was ever a transparent case of the art of entitlement by association, it is that of controversial businessman and president of the Progressive Professionals Forum (PPF) Mzwanele Jimmy Manyi setting himself up for a R1.6 million salary as director-general in the department of mineral resources. It is a mystery how Manyi, despite being an outspoken supporter of the embattled President Jacob Zuma and an ardent advocate of the Gupta family, could have imagined that his lack of background in the department concerned could possibly have passed muster. Yet Manyi, known as a leading proponent of the white monopoly capital theory and his public call for radical economic transformation , has been in the running for the job at the mineral resources department. He was the preferred applicant, reportedly since 2014, of Mosebenzi Zwane, who became the minister of mineral resources in September 2015 after succeeding the sacked Ngoako Ramatlhodi. Manyi had already held director-general posts in two departments, labour and the government communication and information system the ANC s top spin doctor but lacked the required appropriate tertiary qualification, a postgraduate degree, plus a thorough understanding of the complexities of mining regulations and the industry. Ramatlhodi blocked the appointment, effectively dropping Manyi down a proverbial mineshaft, despite the former government mouthpiece having had an initial interview, as this was clearly not a viable option. But that the whole rigmarole happened in the first place points to the type of elitist cronyism which Zuma, the Guptas and the concept of a captive state have been repeatedly accused of. It is also indicative of the ruling party s recycling of cadres referred to as redeployment which has repeatedly attempted to force square pegs into round holes, to the detriment of us all.
