A video of an athlete experiencing perhaps one of the most embarrassing moments in her sporting career has emerged, and it&#8217;s hilarious. In the video, an apparently long-haired long jump athlete can be seen in an amateur recording shot off a TV. All appears to go well in her run-up, and she launches herself into an almighty leap, though she appears to do better in the height stakes, and less in the direction. Veering inexorably to the left, she lands with a pained expression and her head whips backwards suddenly from the impact in the dirt. Her wig goes flying, and it takes her a while to realise it&#8217;s gone. The guy filming the performance can be heard giggling throughout. The best part of the video is how the woman, whose identity is not named, just gets on with it. She puts on and straightens out her head stocking, and the wig goes right back where it belongs, ready for the next jump. As if being targeted by nyaope addicts was not bad enough!
