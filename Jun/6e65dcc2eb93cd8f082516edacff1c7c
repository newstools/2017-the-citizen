Proteas skipper AB de Villiers has outlasted numerous coaches in his international career. Two of them Corrie van Zyl and Gary Kirsten left because of disappointments in ICC tournaments, the 2011 World Cup and 2013 s Champions Trophy respectively.

The governing body insists they&#8217;ve had to do so to comply with South African labour law but have encouraged Domingo to re-apply. Naturally, De Villiers&#8217; comment led to an obvious follow-up question: would that mean he&#8217;d like to see Domingo stay on? &#8220;Yes, definitely,&#8221; was his emphatic reply. Another prominent sub-plot for this match is the presence of Mickey Arthur, Pakistan&#8217;s head coach. Arthur was in charge of the Proteas for a relatively fruitful period from mid-2005 to early 2010. Ironically, early elimination from 2009&#8217;s Champions Trophy at home was one of the major factors that led to his demise. But De Villiers was reluctant to make any comparisons between Arthur and Domingo. &#8220;They&#8217;re completely different. Obviously different human beings. Both very nice guys, really good men and I get along with both of them,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Mickey, it&#8217;s such a long time ago. I can&#8217;t remember his coaching style really. We had a lot of success under him, and I have good memories of him as coach with us. But that&#8217;s long gone. It&#8217;s something in the past.&#8221; &nbsp; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
