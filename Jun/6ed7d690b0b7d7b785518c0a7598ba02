South Africa great Barry Richards believes the rise of Kagiso Rabada has &#8220;lessened the pain&#8221; of Dale Steyn&#8217;s absence ahead of a Test series in England. Steyn, perhaps the best fast bowler of his generation, has been ruled out of the four-Test campaign with a longstanding shoulder problem. Also read: AB de Villiers Proteas future clarified by August But Rabada has helped fill the gap, the 22-year-old quick taking 71 wickets in 17 Tests at an impressively low average of 23.69 since making his debut against India at Mohali in November 2015. &#8220;I think a lot of people were really wobbly about Steyn and the injuries he&#8217;s had, the age group, he&#8217;s in,&#8221; said Richards, the outstanding opening batsman of the early 1970s, in London on Thursday. &#8220;Then Rabada popped out of the woodwork and he&#8217;s been absolutely fantastic. He bowls at a good pace, nice, easy action. If conditions are right, he&#8217;ll swing it way which is a real asset for a fast bowler. &#8220;From a South African point of view, he&#8217;s been fantastic for us and really lessened the pain of Dale Steyn not being in the set-up. &#8220;But I think our fast-bowling stocks are pretty good. Chris Morris as an all-rounder, and then Morne Morkel &#8211; he always looks like he should do well but he always bowls that yard too short for me.&#8221; Meanwhile, Richards believes AB de Villiers should give up the one-day captaincy. &#8220;The De Villiers thing has escalated,&#8221; he said Richards. &#8220;It&#8217;s become a bigger issue than it should have been. It should have been managed a lot better a long time ago. Faf du Plessis has done a very good job and I think he can do a good job in all three formats. If AB wants to carry on playing he should give away the captaincy and concentrate on his batting. &#8220;He&#8217;s a wonderful player but in the last few months I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ve seen the best of him.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter. &nbsp;
