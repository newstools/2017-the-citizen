Former presenter of SABC&#8217;s 50/50 and Pretoria FM Johann Botha was reportedly shot and killed during a robbery at Zebra Inn, near Maboneng, Johannesburg, on Wednesday night. According to Pretoria FM reporter Anton Meijer on Twitter, the owner of the bar in which Botha died was also shot dead. The suspects, three men and one woman, reportedly demanded cash from the owner. They made off with two firearms and an undisclosed amount of cash. The four suspects are still at large. Botha is a former host of TV show 50/50 and also contributed to M-Net&#8217;s Carte Blanche. &#8220;Johann&#8217;s death was a giant loss for the country, media and the people of South Africa. His death once again underscores the violent crimes,&#8221; said Radio Sonder Grense (RSG). His friend Johan Marais has taken to social media to share his condolences. &#8220;The charismatic and talented Johann Botha has been killed in a robbery. My sincere condolences to those close to him. Many of you will remember Johann from 50/50 and Aardwolf as well as a variety of radio broadcasts on classical music,&#8221; he wrote.
