Fake news being spread on social media is posing a huge threat to efforts to relieve and successfully counter the situation caused by the devastating fires in the Garden Route, reports the Knysna-Plett Herald. &#8220;Rumours and fake news currently doing the rounds that two people with petrol cans had been arrested in connection with the fires in George and surroundings, are utterly false and unfounded,&#8221; said Captain Malcolm Pojie. &#8220;No arrests in this regard have been made yet. This same voice note alleges involvement of the two &#8216;suspects&#8217; in the devastating fires from Knysna to Port Elizabeth. This is also not true. &#8220;Further rumours indicating the hijacking of delivery trucks transporting relief packages to Knysna are also untrue.&#8221; The police appeals to social media operators to revert from this practice as it creates further havoc and chaos in a situation where resources are already stretched to its limits. &#8220;We have increased visibility on the main and exit routes to and from Knysna by redirecting Saps and traffic, both local and provincial officials en-route to ensure safety of all road users and the public in general,&#8221; added Pojie.
