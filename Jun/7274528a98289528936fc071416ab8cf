Two police officials, accused of being involved in two armed robberies at different business premises, appeared in a court in Cape Town on Thursday. Both officials were based at the Ravensmead police station in Cape Town. Craig Viljoen, 34, and Phikolomzi Mbawu, 36, their ranks not given on the charge sheet, appeared in the Goodwood District Court before magistrate Sean Lea, who remanded them to July 10. Both were refused bail at an earlier hearing, following their arrests on April 25, and their appearance on Thursday was their fourth. Senior State advocate Helene Booysen, currently attached to the Western Cape Directorate for Public Prosecutions, has been assigned to prosecute the case. According to the charge sheet, the first alleged robbery happened on July 17, 2015, at a tobacconist shop in Bothasig, and the second at a Chinese shop on the Cape Flats, when they allegedly stole R43 000 cash and cell phones, on April 5, last year. The charge sheet does not indicate what was stolen at the tobacconist shop. Viljoen s address was given on the charge sheet as Kleinvlei, while Mbawu has an address in Mfuleni.
