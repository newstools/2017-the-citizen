18:52 FULL TIME! Excellent performance from the Boks. They win 37-14. And we&#8217;ll leave the last word for a Springbok legend! So many positives and lots to get excited about!! Congrats @WarrenWhiteley @AllisterCoetzee @Springboks &mdash; Bryan Habana (@BryanHabana) June 10, 2017 18:43 Correct. Allister Coetzee has gotten everything right: selection, game plan, subs, timing of subs, trust in Lions players. &mdash; Sibusiso Mjikeliso (@Sbu_Mjikeliso) June 10, 2017 18:38 SPRINGBOKS 37 &#8211; FRANCE 14 (Try Jan Serfontein) It&#8217;s turning out into a magnificent evening for the Boks! Francois Hougaard hits a gap and his short pass is brilliantly timed to Andries Coetzee. The fullback doesn&#8217;t quite have the legs but Jan Serfontein does, diving smartly. 18:35 TRY TIME! The @Springboks show character as they hit back with two quick-fire tries against France. It&#39;s 30-14 after 63 mins.#SSRugby pic.twitter.com/isHUVJy5bW &mdash; SuperSport (@SuperSportTV) June 10, 2017 18:32 SPRINGBOKS 30 &#8211; FRANCE 14 (Try Ross Cronje) Superb from the Boks! Jean-Luc du Preez is a decoy line-out jumper and the ball is thrown over, where Warren Whiteley finds Cronje, who runs in untouched. That was a planned move! 18:29 SPRINGBOKS 23 &#8211; FRANCE 14 (Penalty try) Warren Whiteley breaks on the openside and a clever kick forward releases Courtnall Skosan. He&#8217;s tackled without the ball and Glen Jackson awards a penalty try. More controversially, Dulin is given a yellow card. Very tough call against France, Skosan reaching for ball above his head &amp; Dulin plays him split-second too early. Penalty try &amp; yellow card! &mdash; Ken Borland (@KenBorland) June 10, 2017 18:25 Costly tackle miss by Jesse Kriel, Chavancy runs straight over him &#8211; concussing him. Then scrumhalf Serin darts over from ruck. 14-16 55th &mdash; Ken Borland (@KenBorland) June 10, 2017 18:23 SPRINGBOKS 16 &#8211; FRANCE 14 (Try Baptiste Serin) Missed tackle by Kriel in midfield gives the French a hoothold and replacement scrumhalf Baptiste Serin dummies over. 18:17 Tell that to the SACP&#8230; Marx is a star. Malcolm, I mean, not Oom Karl. #SAvFRA &mdash; Max du Preez (@MaxduPreez) June 10, 2017 18:14 He&#8217;s been excellent. .@kolisi1 is the one #Stormers player showing he can keep up with the &#39;Bok Lions&#39; high tempo #SAvFRA &mdash; Ashfak Mohamed (@ashfakmohamed) June 10, 2017 18:04 Some stats from the first half: Boks made 413m, their tackle completion rate was 86% and they made 4 linebreaks. Impressively, they only knocked on twice. 17:54 Solid as you like from the Boks. Definitely a nice new positive edge. Look happy to be out there. &mdash; Front Row Grunt (@FrontRowGrunt) June 10, 2017 17:53 Elton Jantjies &mdash; Sibusiso Mjikeliso (@Sbu_Mjikeliso) June 10, 2017 17:51 SOUTH AFRICA 16 &#8211; FRANCE 7 (Penalty Elton Jantjies) French don&#8217;t release the ball-carrier and Jantjies kicks his third penalty. 17:48 But now Coetzee messes up at other end, totally missed bouncing ball from Huget&#39;s chip ahead, allowed centre Chavancy to gather &amp; dot down &mdash; Ken Borland (@KenBorland) June 10, 2017 17:46 SPRINGBOKS 13 &#8211; FRANCE 7 (Try Henry Chavancy) Clever kick over the top as Andries Coetzee misses in-touch and France pounce. Clumsy from the Boks. 17:44 Andries Coetsee is here to stay,loving what I&#39;m seeing so far,specially from the new boys,lekker manne! &mdash; Breyton Paulse (@BreytonPaulse) June 10, 2017 17:42 SPRINGBOKS 13 &#8211; FRANCE 0 (Try Jesse Kriel) Brilliant from Andries Coetzee! After getting tackled, he releases, picks up and finds Malcolm Marx. Marx finds the scoring pass to Kriel. Excellent play from the Lions fullback. 17:38 Siya Kolisi spots a massive gap at the breakdown and breaks the line. His pass to Cronje is a tad too early and some good scrambling from the French sees the Boks hold on. The home side is looking good but they need to be more accurate. 17:37 Rather bizarre decision by Plisson to go for the crosskick, 7 metres from the tryline. Turned it into a contestable &amp; Skosan did well enough &mdash; Ken Borland (@KenBorland) June 10, 2017 17:34 Early verdict: Better than last year. Not nearly as panicky with ball in hand. What do you guys and gals think? #SAvFRA #SSRugby &mdash; Xola Ntshinga (@XolaNtshinga) June 10, 2017 17:31 Malcolm Marx has been outstanding to date. Marx is an animal. Imagine he had played all year last year! &mdash; Front Row Grunt (@FrontRowGrunt) June 10, 2017 Malcolm Marx is playing like a really upset MTN customer. #SSRUGBY &mdash; Peter de Villiers (@Coachdivvy) June 10, 2017 17:28 Yeah, they&#8217;re not playing all that well&#8230; Did the French practice with the Bulls this week? &mdash; Peter de Villiers (@Coachdivvy) June 10, 2017 17:26 France looking about as good as the glue used for their jersey numbers &#8230; great kick Jantjies!! &mdash; Front Row Grunt (@FrontRowGrunt) June 10, 2017 17:23 SPRINGBOKS 6 &#8211; FRANCE 0 (Penalty Elton Jantjies) The French engaged in dangerous play at a Bok line-out. Jantjies punishes. 17:21 Liking the look of this @Springboks team. Great combinations &amp; look refreshing &amp; confident with that ball in hand. #Boks 3 &#8211; 0 #Fra #RSAvFRA &mdash; Thabiso Sithole (@ThabisoSithole) June 10, 2017 17:20 SPRINGBOKS 3 &#8211; FRANCE 0 (Penalty Elton Jantjies) The Boks keep ball well, with Ross Cronje impressing with his control. The French are caugh offside and Jantjies pops over an easy penalty. 17:17 Oupa Mohoje finds a gap and the Boks generally keep possession well but run out of space. 17:15 1st French lineout &amp; they get rolling maul going, collapsed, but Jules Plisson is wide with the penalty. Good defence from Rhule on restart &mdash; Ken Borland (@KenBorland) June 10, 2017 17:13 Springboks get an early let-off after Elton Jantjies overcooks a kick and the forwards concede a penalty from a line-out. The kick to posts is missed. o-0 after 5 min. 17:12 Hope it&#8217;s wrong. Jesse Kriel is built like a tank, but being in shape and being in form are two different things unfortunately. &mdash; Peter de Villiers (@Coachdivvy) June 10, 2017 17:09 It&#8217;s kick-off time! 17:03 Somebody sign Impi immediately!!! &mdash; John Smit (@JohnSmit123) June 10, 2017 17:01 The Springboks&#8217; Impi is on the field. What an impressively built man! 17:00 Perspective&#8230; Boks can&#39;t sellout Loftus&#8230;.combo of tough economic times and a struggling team. #RSAvFRA &mdash; Craig Ray (@craigray11) June 10, 2017 16:58 Almost time for the national anthems. The Loftus grandstand is quite full but there are still some open spots. 16:38 The Proteas play a make-or-break game against India in the ICC Champions Trophy on Sunday. They&#8217;re supporting their counterparts. Sending best wishes to the @Springboks @BafanaBafana all the way from London #proudlysa pic.twitter.com/2tbPhPOn74 &mdash; Cricket South Africa (@OfficialCSA) June 10, 2017 16:34 In case you missed it (but it would be sad), here&#8217;s the Springbok team for today: (15-1): Andries Coetzee, Raymond Rhule, Jesse Kriel, Jan Serfontein, Courtnall Skosan, Elton Jantjies, Ross Cronje, Warren Whiteley, Oupa Mohoje, Siya Kolisi, Franco Mostert, Eben Etzebeth, Frans Malherbe, Malcolm Marx, Beast Mtawarira. Bench: Bongi Mbonambi, Steven Kitshoff, Coenie Oosthuizen, Pieter-Steph du Toit, Jean-Luc du Preez, Francois Hougaard, Frans Steyn, Dillyn Leyds. 16:26 Given how poor the Bulls are playing, it&#8217;s not difficult to achieve this. Stadium filling up nicely with just over 30min left before kick-off #RSAvFRA &mdash; #RugbyFifteen.com (@RugbyFifteen) June 10, 2017 16:21 Here&#8217;s Frans Steyn&#8217;s big boot! We&#8217;ve missed that&#8230; Frans Steyn slotting them over from 50m out in the warmups. Still think Boks could use his kicking game from outset in #SAvFRA pic.twitter.com/mVjRYEOTbM &mdash; Jon Cardinelli (@jon_cardinelli) June 10, 2017 16:12 Andries Coetzee, Courtnall Skosan and Raymond Rhule better not have butterfingers at the back. France out practicing their kicking. Will they test new Bok back 3 with the high ball, or keep ball in hand? #SAvFRA pic.twitter.com/oZq26nul2F &mdash; SA Rugby magazine (@SARugbymag) June 10, 2017 16:10 Former Bok flyhalf Naas Botha makes a good point in the SuperSport studio regarding all the new guys. &#8220;We always ask why in-form players aren&#8217;t picked. This year that&#8217;s happened. So we can&#8217;t really complain can we?&#8221; One has to agree. 16:09 His first coin toss as Springboks captain, done @warrenwhiteley #LoveRugby pic.twitter.com/zbDSARWEjC &mdash; South African Rugby (@Springboks) June 10, 2017 16:00 How will the Boks play? It&#8217;s all about balance (apparently). Interestingly, Warren Whiteley also had to balance life and rugby this week.. READ HERE about that. 15:57 He still divides opinion but there&#8217;s a sense that Frans Steyn provides much needed &#8220;security&#8221; to a young side. Coach Allister Coetzee has spoken highly of the experienced utility back. He has walked this walk 53 times before before a test match. So welome back to Frans @fsteyn12 playing off the bench today. #LoveRugby pic.twitter.com/utN7aAOvnl &mdash; South African Rugby (@Springboks) June 10, 2017 15:53 Great excitement at Loftus Versfeld as Springboks bus arrives to test match against @FFRugby in just over hour. @MTNza @ASICS_ZA #LoveRugby pic.twitter.com/IbRxAYwW22 &mdash; South African Rugby (@Springboks) June 10, 2017 15:51 New Bok skipper Warren Whiteley is in real good company! Two former #Springboks captains, @VictorMatfield and Jean de Villiers wishing @WarrenWhiteley well in his first test as captain. #LoveRugby pic.twitter.com/5WjSDshvey &mdash; South African Rugby (@Springboks) June 10, 2017 15:46 Good start at Loftus apparently&#8230; The DJ at Loftus just played Shumaya&#8230;.. there&#39;s hope&#8230;. &mdash; Khanyiso Tshwaku (@kaymorizm) June 10, 2017 15:45 Welcome to the first Springbok Test of 2017! Allister Coetzee and his men have pressed the reset button following last year&#8217;s nightmares. But the doubts will remain until the Boks deliver some good performances.
