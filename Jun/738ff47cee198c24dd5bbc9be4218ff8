Police in Port Elizabeth are investigating a case of attempted murder after a mother and her daughter were found brutally beaten in their home in the city, Eastern Cape police said on Sunday. Provincial police spokeswoman Brigadier Marinda Mills said a 47-year-old woman and her three-year-old daughter were found battered in their home in Chatty over the weekend. It is alleged that on Saturday, about [6pm], concerned neighbours went to the victim s house and when she did not respond to their knock on the door they entered. They found the mother and daughter with multiple head injuries, Mills said. Both mother and child were taken to hospital. At this stage the motive for the brutal attack was unknown and no arrests had yet been made. Bethelsdorp police appealed to community members who may be able to assist with the investigation to come forward with information. Acting Mount Road policing cluster commander Brigadier Keith Meyer condemned the attack. As South Africans we have an obligation to report violence and abuse. As we observe child protection week we need to reinforce the duty of everyone in the protection of children from violence, exploitation, and abuse, Meyer said.
