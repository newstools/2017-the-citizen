Marawa and his producer Beverly Maphanga are in hot water at the SABC for playing audio from the broadcaster&#8217;s prime competitor, SuperSport. The audio clip was of Sizwe Mabena and played during Marawa&#8217;s Metro FM radio show. Marawa tweeted he would not be on his show because of Maphanga&#8217;s suspension. 1)My Producer Beverly Maphangwa has been suspended 4 &quot;non-compliance/contravention of contract.&quot;The crime?

SABC group executive for sports Sully Motsweni is said to have gained support from acting group CEO Theliso Ralitabo and acting general manager for radio Orapeleng Lebethe in firing Marawa. He has been summoned to a meeting where Motsweni apparently will hand him a termination letter based on misconduct on Monday. Marawa said he was unaware of the meeting and was not fazed by the possibility of being fired. He explained the tweets were factually correct and SABC and MultiChoice had a partnership agreement. Marawa blamed the fracas surrounding his producer on an unnamed manager he believes is set on disrupting the handling of his show.
