For the hate, the ugly names, the resistance, the jealousy, the negativity.. Made me work harder &amp; now, I&#39;m a millionaire &mdash; Bonang B* Matheba (@bonang_m) June 28, 2017 She further told her followers she needed another 17 years to become a billionaire. &#8220;Trust me, I wrote it down. I just need to work hard. &#8220;Basically&#8230;. I&#8217;m 30 and killing it. The thirties come with a whole lot of confidence, why you didn&#8217;t tell me boo? I love u forever,&#8221; she told one of her followers. Some, however, do not believe Bonang wrote the tweets herself, as &#8220;they have that arrogance of AKA&#8221;, while others have argued it was not her haters but supporters who made her a millionaire. &#8220;How is being a millionaire life&#8217;s utopia? Hard work should be celebrated and indeed encouraged&#8230;but hanging out your financial position? Nah,&#8221; added another. Also read: What Bonang hopes to achieve before she dies &nbsp;
