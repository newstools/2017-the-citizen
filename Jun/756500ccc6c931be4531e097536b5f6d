American artist R Kelly has recently shared a video of a man from KwaZulu-Natal performing one of his hit songs, Bad Man, and he seems to be impressed. The singer has been sharing videos of fans&#8217; renditions of his songs on Twitter every Monday, and this week, all roads led to a taxi rank in Durban. In the video, a man can be seen walking around as he sings the hit song. Some people in the background can be heard laughing as they encourage the cameraman to take every moment of the performance. &#8220;I was born in these streets, raised in these streets, walked in these streets, taught by these streets, lived in these streets,&#8221; the man can be heard singing, a chorus from the song. &#8220;This weeks #FANFEATUREMONDAY travels all the way to Durban, South Africa, and this fan&#8217;s rendition of #BadMan &#8211; I love how universal music is,&#8221; said R Kelly of the fan&#8217;s performance.

Kelly (@rkelly) June 19, 2017 The man has received positive comments on Twitter, with most hoping someone notices him and gives him the break he seems to be waiting for in life. &#8220;They thought it was funny, meanwhile dude was killing it. I just wish that he would get some help cause clearly he on the streets,&#8221; said one Twitter user, while another said the best thing that could out of the video would be a feature with R Kelly when he visits South Africa again. &#8220;Met this guy sometime last month. I even recorded him singing Kiss and say Goodbye by The Manhattans. Great talent, he need to be polished,&#8221; said another.
