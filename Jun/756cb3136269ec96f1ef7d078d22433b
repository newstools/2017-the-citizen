This Youth Day, 5FM is giving their youthful listeners an opportunity to live their radio dream and live loud with their favourite station. Kicking off with The Roger Goode Show at 06:00, followed by HammanTime at 09:00, The Forbes &amp; Fix Show at 12:00 and ending with The Thabooty Drive at 15:00, 5FM will have two people join the teams on each show. The station invites youth, who will be known as the 5 Squad, between the ages of 15-20 to send an entertaining voice demo or voice note of no more than 3 minutes (and no bigger than 6MB) to liveloud@5fm.co.za . The entry should include a short motivation as to why they should be a 5FM DJ for a day. Entrants will need to be based in Johannesburg or Cape Town or able to get to the respective studio after school or campus on Thursday, 15 June as well as on 16 June for the show they will be chosen to participate in. More details are available on their website. Brought to you by People Magazine For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
