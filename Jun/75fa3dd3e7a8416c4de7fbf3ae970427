Germany&#8217;s Eintracht Frankfurt have bought themselves a new weapon: Nelson Mandela. But don&#8217;t get spooked, it&#8217;s not our iconic president. Instead, it&#8217;s an 18-year-old forward from Cameroon named after South Africa&#8217;s first democratically-elected leader. Eintracht Frankfurt signed Nelson Mandela. All that I&#39;m saying is give him a chance pic.twitter.com/QUwRYv8t1n &mdash; Tancredi Palmeri (@tancredipalmeri) June 23, 2017 Nelson Mandela Mbouhom was a youth player at Barcelona before moving to Germany at age 13. He began at Hoffenheim before Frankfurt swooped in. Following a solid season in 2016/17 for the U-19 side, where he scored 8 goals in 14 games, the Bundesliga side decided to hand him his first professional contract.
