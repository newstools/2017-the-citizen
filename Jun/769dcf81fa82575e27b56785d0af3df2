The original apology which Zille was meant to read out at a press conference last week appears to have been changed to suit the former DA leader. According to Sunday Times, the draft apology included words such as &#8216;profound offence, apologise to black South Africans offended, my subsequent defence of it and I realise the hurt this has caused&#8217; and was instead altered by Zille and her legal team to &#8216;I recognise this offence, I therefore apologise to South Africans who may have been offended, my subsequent explanation of it and wounds of history may have been opened up.&#8217; Sources told the weekly that Zille had considered reaching a settlement when her disciplinary hearing was set to get underway. Her final apology appears to have been edited to avoid Zille taking full responsibility of the tweets she sent out about colonialism and how it was not all bad. About the &#8216;watered-down apology&#8217; Zille said this was untrue. &#8220;Absolutely not. Anyone who says so is lying. In fact, the final draft was toughened from the original. I don&#8217;t know who is leaking this fake news. I have zero interest in discussing the details. But you can accept the departure point as fact. It was toughened,&#8221; she said. DA leader Mmusi Maimane could not be reached for comment while DA chief of staff, Geordin Hill-Lewis and head of strategy Gavin Davis would not comment.
