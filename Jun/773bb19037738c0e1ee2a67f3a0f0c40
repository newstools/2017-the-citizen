Another ICC tournament, another massive disappointment. Whether he likes it or not, Proteas skipper AB de Villiers is the flagbearer of that failure as leader. Also read: Bumbling Proteas crash and burn out of the Champions Trophy And to just make it more awkward, the batting dynamo has been grabbing much of the attention &#8230; for the wrong reasons. Following Sunday&#8217;s comprehensive eight-wicket loss to India, this is what De Villiers had to say on various issues. On whether he still wants to play in 2019 World Cup&#8230; Absolutely. On whether he still believes he should be captaining the ODI side&#8230; I&#8217;m a good captain and I can take this team forward. I can take us to win a World Cup, I believe. And I believed the same thing in this tournament and the last one. I love the captaincy. On why the Proteas keep winning series but can&#8217;t be successful in ICC tournaments&#8230; Tournaments are a little bit different. You play different teams all the time at different venues. No one said it&#8217;s going to be easy. But we do come up short for some reason in tournaments like this, and it is pretty sad. I can&#8217;t explain to you exactly what happens. I think you saw it in this game. Just a very poor batting performance. Nothing to do with the energy or the intensity or the belief in the team. We felt we had a great chance today. We came here to win the game of cricket. On whether the Proteas need changes after this misadventure&#8230; That&#8217;s a question can only be answered by people who are in control of making radical decisions. That&#8217;s not my decision, that. We&#8217;ll have to wait and see what people out there want to decide or whoever is in control. I don&#8217;t think we are a bad cricket team. On how far the Proteas are actually away of winning a major tournament&#8230; Not a lot of people will believe me but I feel it&#8217;s pretty close. I don&#8217;t think it feels far away. It&#8217;s very difficult to say that after a performance like this, but that&#8217;s what I believe in my heart. I believe we&#8217;re very close as a unit. There&#8217;s more than enough talent, and we&#8217;ve just got to get it right when it matters most. For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
