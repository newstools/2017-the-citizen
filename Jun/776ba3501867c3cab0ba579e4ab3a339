Jockey Muzi Yeni, seventh on the national jockeys log, can bid bon voyage to Flamingo Park punters today by bringing home the banker, Roy s Dispren, in Race 5 over 1800m. This week Yeni will be jetting off to ride in Mauritius. He has partnered the Corrie Lensley-trained gelding in the four-year-old s last three starts and they have delivered the goods on each occasion, beating Double Bind over 1600m the last two times. Roy s Dispren tries further this time but tends to keep on strongly at the finish in his races, so the 200m longer distance should not be too much of a concern. He is drawn at No 7 and the only concern is that his merit rating went up five points for his last win. First Sea Lord finished four lengths behind Roy s Dispren a week ago and, although he might battle to turn the tables on 2.5kg better terms, he could be second best. Mpumelelo Mjoka s 2kg allowance could help Quid Rides into the money. This five-year-old needed his last run, when a well-beaten fifth behind Royal Master. He will be fitter now. Yeni and Lensley could also win Race 10 over 1200m. They team up with Justash, who seems to have lost form recently, with excuses readily available for his last two races, and he meets a weak field. Roy s Ambassador, who makes his Flamingo Park debut, could be the right one for the Exactas. There were excuses for his last race and he ran on to edge out Trendy Guy over 1400m at Scottsville in his second-last outing.
