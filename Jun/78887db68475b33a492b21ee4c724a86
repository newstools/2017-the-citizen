The price of both grades of petrol will drop by 25c/l with effect from midnight on Tuesday, the energy department said. The wholesale price of both grades of diesel would drop by 23c/l, the department said in a statement on Saturday. The wholesale price of illuminating paraffin would drop by 22c/l and the single maximum national retail price (SMNRP) by 30c/l. The maximum retail price of LPGas would drop by 77c/kg. The decrease in fuel prices was due to the average international product prices of petrol, diesel, and illuminating paraffin dropping during the period under review April 26 to June 1. The rand had also appreciated against the US dollar during this period, on average, when compared to the previous period, the department said.
