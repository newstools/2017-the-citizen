Flex Rabanyan has won season two of SA s biggest hip-hop reality show, The Hustle. Rabanyan was crowned champion of the rap game on Vuzu AMP, defeating fellow finalist Joshua The I-AM. TV viewers were given the opportunity to choose the winner via WeChat and they decided that the hottest MC in Mzansi right now is Rabanyan. The show was locally produced by AKA, who was also on the panel of judges, alongside SA hip-hop royalty Khuli Chana and Stogie T. Joining the panel was Siyabonga Scoop Ngwekazi, who presented the show. Rabanyan, 22, who hails from eSikhawini in KwaZulu-Natal, walked away with a R250 000 cash prize, an Opel Corsa Sport, a record deal with Vth Season and a PR contract with African Star Communications. I am overjoyed, said Rabanyan. I feel good, it s a proud moment. I m proud of what I have achieved and the people around me. Going into the show, he didn t have a strategy, but he had drive and determination and knew what he wanted to get out of it. He initially wanted to walk out of the show as a brand. I wanted to just show people who I am and give them my thoughts. Luckily, it worked out, so it turned out that everyone could relate to the story, he said. Joshua The I AM didn t go home empty-handed, pocketing R50 000. I didn t expect to make it this far, this whole journey has been crazy, said Joshua. Being one of the top two rappers in the country right now, without a deal, is crazy. Technically, I am the number one rapper in the country right now, without a deal. Flex got the deal, he added, laughing. An excited Rabanyan promised to give people a whole lot of fresh music . He is planning to get it right by distributing his music the proper way , as he doesn t want to flood the market. My upcoming single is going to be a surprise, he said. People must just be on the lookout. news@citizen.co.za
