Prophet Paseka &#8216;Mboro&#8217; Motsoeneng of Incredible Happenings Ministries has made headlines again after a &#8220;miracle&#8221; that &#8220;brought back&#8221; 97-year-old Wilhelmina Phiri to life. Phiri was at her mother&#8217;s funeral on Saturday in Hammanskraal on Saturday morning when she collapsed. Mboro reportedly attended to her, and told her it was not her time to die. &#8220;Open your eyes!&#8221; he was quoted as saying by The Daily Sun. He then picked her up, much to the mourners&#8217; astonishment. Mboro told the tabloid what happened on Saturday was a miracle from God. When I touched her, I realised she had succumbed to death. I spoke to God and asked him to extend her living years, he was quoted as saying. He further said the gogo wanted to die because she felt that after the death of her mother, who died at the age of 137, no one would help her family. &#8220;I will always be there for them,&#8221; he said.
