A domestic worker was attacked by two Rottweilers in the east of Pretoria on Tuesday. The domestic worker s employer Cyril Blom said the attack happened around 14:00pm, Rekord East reported. Our domestic worker left our home at 14:00pm. Not long after, I received a call from our neighbour, said Blom. The dogs also bit my neighbour as he was trying to get the dogs off our domestic worker and he had to be taken to the hospital. Blom said they finally got the dogs off the domestic worker by spraying them with a hose pipe. He said the domestic worker was taken to Steve Biko hospital in a serious condition. She sustained injuries to both her arms, one of her legs and her head, he said. A piece of her arm, almost as big as my fist, was ripped out by the dogs. Blom said this was not the first time the dogs had displayed an aggressive nature. He said about two months ago they got into a fight with two boerboels in the neighbourhood. One of the boerboels was seriously injured during the fight. &#8211; Caxton News Service For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
