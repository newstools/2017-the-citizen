Australian tennis great Margaret Court has caused controversy with her comments about lesbians in tennis and transgender children. On Wednesday, Court, who is a church pastor, told Vision Christian Radio that she wasn&#8217;t &#8220;against&#8221; gay people but wanted to &#8220;help them overcome&#8221;. She also claimed that transgender children had had their minds corrupted, comparing the phenomenon to brain-washing by Hitler and communist countries. Here are some of her quotes from down the years: Tennis &#8216;full of lesbians&#8217; &#8220;I mean, tennis is full of lesbians, because even when I was playing there was only a couple there, but those couple that led took young ones into parties and things.&#8221; (May 2017) &#8216;That&#8217;s what Hitler did&#8217; &#8220;That&#8217;s all the devil&#8230; but that&#8217;s what Hitler did and that&#8217;s what communism did &#8212; got the mind of the children. And there&#8217;s a whole plot in our nation, and in the nations of the world to get the minds of the children.&#8221; (On transgender children, in May 2017) &#8216;Marriage between man and woman&#8217; &#8220;You stand with values for family and different things, so you are a voice, and then you get persecuted for that. You are not hating the people. You love the people, but you get taken that way. And I say marriage is between a man and a woman.&#8221; (January 2017) Women&#8217;s tennis is &#8216;boring&#8217; &#8220;The men, I enjoy (watching play). The women, I don&#8217;t enjoy so much, because it&#8217;s up and down the centre the whole time. I think it&#8217;s boring.&#8221; (January 2016) &#8216;Nobody will hit my 62&#8217; &#8220;If she (Serena Williams) beats my (Grand Slam singles) record, she deserves it. I&#8217;m not going to lose any sleep over it&#8230; Nobody will ever hit my 62.&#8221; (On her record of 62 singles, doubles and mixed Grand Slam titles, January 2017) In praise of apartheid &#8220;South Africans have this thing better organised than any other country, particularly America. I love South Africa, I&#8217;ll go back there any time.&#8221; (During the apartheid era in January 1970) For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
