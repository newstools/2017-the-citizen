Internationally acclaimed DJ/producer and Soulistic Music record label owner Black Coffee recently bought the popular entertainment spot in Soweto called Zone 6. The venue in Diepkloof is known for hosting the biggest music shows in the country, it is also one of the most sought after in South Africa. The venue has hosted the likes of AKA, Kwesta and Cassper Nyovest, as well as events such as The Supa Mega Show, Black Coffee&#8217;s BET celebration, Authentic Sundays and MTV Base music concerts, to mention but a few. We are obviously very excited about the acquisition, but what is even more thrilling is the fact that we can further contribute to the culture. This is main reason we decided to invest in the venue,&#8221; said Black Coffee&#8217;s business manager, Amaru Da Costa. Other than a few operational improvements, it s business as usual. Chris Hajibey and his team will continue to manage the venue and people can look forward to the many more exciting upcoming events,&#8221; he added I have a good relationship with Black Coffee and Soulistic Music. I respect their business ethics, hard work and discipline, and they are people I trust to take this place to even greater heights. Partnering with this incredible team is an honour for me, said Black Coffee s new business partner and venue manager Chris Hajibey. The venue accommodates up to 4 000 people, and has two floors and an outside sitting area with a swimming pool. ALSO READ: Cassper Nyovest drops music video for Superman ft. Tsepo Tshola &nbsp;
