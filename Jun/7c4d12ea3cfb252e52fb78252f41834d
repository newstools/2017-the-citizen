Metrorail Gauteng has halted operations in east Johannesburg after two trains collided in Elandsfontein early on Thursday morning. The number of injuries, if any, could not immediately be confirmed. Metrorail confirms a rear-end train collision between two trains, T0601 and 1817, at Elandsfontein. Overhead power on all four lines is off from Germiston to Kempton Park, Metrorail acting spokesperson, Tony Games said. Trains running in the affected sections will remain stationery until the technical team on the ground declares an alternative line that is safe for train movement. It is still early to confirm any injuries as I am on my way there to meet the technical team on the ground. Games said Metrorail would like to thank all loyal customers for their understanding and apologised for the inconvenience the accident may cause. The cause of the accident was also being investigated.
