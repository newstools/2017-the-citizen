The South Africa Rugby Union&#8217;s (Saru) plan to make the Springboks a giant in the world game again took further shape on Friday. The governing body announced that Rassie Erasmus will be returning to become SA Rugby&#8217;s director of rugby. It represents a major coup for the previously embattled organisation, who managed to convince the 44-year-old to ditch his head coach role at Irish giants Munster. Erasmus made an immediate impact since being hired there last year and won the local Pro12 Coach-of-the-Year award. However, there had been a clause in his contract stating he can terminate his agreement within six months should an offer from a national side be forthcoming. Erasmus start his tenure at Saru will officially start on 1 January 2018. According to a statement, he&#8217;ll oversee &#8220;all eight national teams and participation and management of 20 competitions as well as the development of players, coaches and referees&#8221;. The former Springboks flanker previously headed Saru&#8217;s rugby department but was unhappy with the predominantly administrative role as well as last year&#8217;s boardroom upheaval within the organisation. It is understood is new role is far more hands-on. While Springboks coach Allister Coetzee will eventually report to Erasmus, his position remains unchanged. Allister has done a great job to turn the Springboks around this season and I can categorically put to rest any idea that he is being replaced as Springbok coach, said Saru chief executive Jurie Roux. We will do everything in our power to support him for the Rugby Championship and everything that lies beyond that. Erasmus&#8217; longtime confidante, Jacques Nienaber, will also return as a high performance coach. For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
