A couple escaped with minor injuries after they were hijacked and bundled into the boot of their car which subsequently overturned in Rustenburg on Sunday, North West police said. A neighbour saw two men shoving the couple into the boot of their car in Tlhabane near Rustenburg while they were parking the car in their yard in the early hours of Sunday morning and immediately phoned the police, Colonel Emelda Setlhako said. It is alleged that the suspects put the owners of the new [VW] Golf 7 inside the boot and drove off. The highway police were alerted and they closed all the major roads in Rustenburg. The said vehicle was spotted at the N4 highway and police chased behind. The suspect lost control and the vehicle overturned, and the victims were still inside the boot. They sustained minor injuries and were taken to a local hospital. The suspects, who are from Soshanguve, Pretoria, were arrested with no injuries, she said. The suspects, aged 29 and 43, were expected to appear in the Bafokeng Magistate s Court in Tlhabane on Monday on charges of hijacking, possession of illegal firearms, and abduction, Setlhako said.
