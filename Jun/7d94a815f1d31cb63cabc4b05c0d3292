Upon being asked in an interview with Thabo Molefe, AKA Tbo Touch, whether he would ever be exposed in the #GuptaLeaks, EFF leader Julius Malema said he had a clear conscience. He said the emails were authentic, which could be seen in the fact that President Jacob Zuma was not taking the media to court despite all his denials. #JuliusMalema says #ANC can never take him to court over his revelations @TheCitizen_News &mdash; Simnikiwe H (@onlynikki89) June 7, 2017 #JuliusMalema says he has never met #Guptas and has never been contacted @TheCitizen_News &mdash; Simnikiwe H (@onlynikki89) June 7, 2017 #JuliusMalema &quot;if they want to kill us they can go and do it but you can never kill our ideas&quot; says if he dies now he dies a hero &mdash; Simnikiwe H (@onlynikki89) June 7, 2017 He told Touch that former president Kgalema Motlanthe had taught them that whatever you do in darkness will come out, and you should be prepared to explain yourself. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know the Guptas, they&#8217;ve never called me, they&#8217;ve never WhatsApped me. I don&#8217;t know them. &#8220;That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m a free soul. Tomorrow I&#8217;ve got a press conference, you must watch.&#8221; #JuliusMalema says tomorrow he will reveal how state money was stolen for #Guptas. Says #GuptaEmails genuine @TheCitizen_News &mdash; Simnikiwe H (@onlynikki89) June 7, 2017 He said that he would be revealing even more damning information about the extent of state capture by the Guptas and how deeply compromised the president is through his son Duduzane and the Gupta family. When asked to reveal his source for all his insider info on the ANC, Malema said: &#8220;If I give you my source, I won&#8217;t have that source tomorrow. I&#8217;ve got tangible information. They can&#8217;t take me to court. Even Zuma can&#8217;t take me to court. He&#8217;s not taking me to court, because he knows it&#8217;s true. &#8220;Tomorrow we&#8217;re bringing tangible evidence of how money went from state institutions into their pockets.&#8221; He further threatened he would expose planned criminality leading up to the ANC&#8217;s December elective conference. Malema added that people on social media kept reminding people of how he had been warning South Africa about state capture for years. &#8220;They remind people: &#8216;Malema spoke about that a long time ago.&#8217; When we spoke about Dubai, no one spoke about it. Now it&#8217;s headlines.&#8221; #JuliusMalema insinuates some intelligence officials could be from #EFF and #DA so they would expose #ANC attempt to abuse state &mdash; Simnikiwe H (@onlynikki89) June 7, 2017 #JuliusMalema says last time spoke to #Zuma was when he congratulated him when after 2014 elections. @TheCitizen_News &mdash; Simnikiwe H (@onlynikki89) June 7, 2017 #JuliusMalema on #Zuma breaking oath of office: President benefited unduly from #nkandla and him paying was admission of guilt &mdash; Simnikiwe H (@onlynikki89) June 7, 2017
