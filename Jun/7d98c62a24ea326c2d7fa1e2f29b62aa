The South African National Civic Organisation (Sanco) on Thursday called for an urgent economic and jobs summit to address concerns of the South African Chamber of Mines regarding the controversial new Mining Charter. Any form of disinvestment in the mining industry and associated job losses have a potential to destabilise communities, as well deepen poverty, unemployment and inequality, said Sanco spokesperson Jabu Mahlangu. The civic movement said the summit must also explore interventions to avert the retrenchment of 8 500 miners announced by AngloGold Ashanti (AGA) on Wednesday, and work to save jobs in the mining sector. Mahlangu said that sustainable mining would only be realised if it included beneficiation, sustainable community development, local procurement and social investment initiatives. While transforming from an extraction economy, the mining industry must contribute towards inclusive growth and the country s economic recovery, he said. He added a win-win solution that would advance transformation was still possible.
