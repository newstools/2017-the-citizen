Australian tennis player Thanasi Kokkinakis has discovered you don&#8217;t mess with big business. Famous cereal company Kellogg&#8217;s has started legal action against the 21-year-old upcoming star after plans emerged that the player and his representatives want to use his nickname, &#8220;Special K&#8221;, commercially. According to local Australian paper the Adelaide Advertiser, Kokkinakis wants to use his &#8220;brand&#8221; on clothing and merchandise. However, Kellogg&#8217;s currently owns the &#8220;Special K&#8221; trademark in Australia for the last 59 years and launched the brand in the USA as early as 1955. A federal court in Adelaide deferred the case of mediation. &#8220;The Kokkinakis Company has applied to register Special K as a trademark and we are defending our trademark,&#8221; a Kellogg&#8217;s spokesperson told the BBC. Kokkinakis wants to follow in the footsteps of Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic and Rafa Nadal by starting his own merchandising business. It brings in millions for those players annually. Kokkinakis has been ravaged by injuries over the past two years and lost in the first round of the French Open last week. For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
