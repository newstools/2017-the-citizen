Queen B s birthday was on the 25th of June and, according to an analysis done by TshisaLIVE, it seems AKA spent about R79 000 for business class flights, accommodation at the Trump International Hotel &amp; Tower New York and fancy meals at Nello restaurant on Madison Avenue in Manhattan. This is the breakdown of how much they reckon AKA splurged on the love of his life: Business class return flights cost the couple R24k each, a total of R50k According to the Trump International Hotel &amp; Towers New York s official website a Rise and Dine package is R6k per night; the couple have been in the city for four nights, racking up an accommodation bill of about R24k On top of that, AKA gifted Bonang with a designer Crepe double-breasted Balmain blazer worth R22k. Everything cost a total of about R97 000 and counting, as the couple is still living it up in the Big Apple. This is not the first time AKA has splashed serious cash on his girlfriend. In January this year, the couple jetted off to Thailand for a holiday that cost over R100k in total. A month later, the couple announced they had broken up, but the day after the announcement, AKA tweeted: I m just a bit crazy and intense.. I m sorry baby we good. The following Monday, AKA surprised Bonang with a R45k Gucci bag at work. AKA documented the gesture on social media, from the in-store purchase to the delivery. Bonang s 30th birthday was nothing but a dream. Let&#8217;s hope we don&#8217;t get another mock breakup right after. ALSO READ: Of all the &#8216;frogs&#8217; to kiss, Mbali chose Black Coffee
