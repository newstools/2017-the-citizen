The body has been named World Taekwondo Federation since 1973, but it has been considering a change since the slang abbreviation &#8216;WTF&#8217; gained currency on social media. &#8220;In the digital age, the acronym of our federation has developed negative connotations unrelated to our organisation and so it was important that we rebranded to better engage with our fans,&#8221; World Taekwondo president Chungwon Choue said on the body&#8217;s website. The rebranding and launch of a new logo reflect a &#8220;commitment to evolving and adapting to remain relevant with today&#8217;s modern audiences&#8221;, World Taekwondo said. The new look for the Korean martial art was unveiled on the eve of the World Taekwondo Championships, which got underway in Muju, South Korea on Saturday.
