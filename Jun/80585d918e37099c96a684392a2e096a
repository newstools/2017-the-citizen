What&#39;s your response? &mdash; TB Joshua (@SCOANTBJoshua) June 4, 2017 For those who were not watching the channel, EFF leader Julius Malema shared his thoughts with his followers on Mnguni&#8217;s visit, saying he was there to seek deliverance. pic.twitter.com/eC0YcwDbDw &mdash; David M Seleka Jr (@MotopiSelekaJr) June 4, 2017 &#8220;The so-called Pastor Penuel Mnguni, known as the &#8216;snake pastor&#8217; from South Africa is in Nigeria to ask for deliverance from the man of God Prophet TB Joshua,&#8221; said Malema, who also went there in 2013 to &#8220;seek blessings&#8221; for his political journey. Malema&#8217;s tweet, however, raised a number of of questions from his followers who questioned whether the Nigerian man was a true prophet. These were some of the comments from his followers: &#8220;What the hell is happening now? Are you losing your mind?Are you bewitched or what? I guess you&#8217;re not so smart if you see Joshua as man of God.&#8221; &#8220;You&#8217;re embarrassing EFF supporters. Are u trying to compete with Zille and Zuma?&#8221; &#8220;He should be banned from entering this country again. TB Joshua should never see SA again!&#8221; &#8220;THIXO wase Enengu State Abuja! That boy will come back worse. All the Impepho available in this country must be lit on his arrival back.&#8221; &#8220;Iyooo&#8230;his congregants will eat bigger reptiles when he comes back.&#8221; &#8220;Y&#8217;all people saying Prophet TB Joshua is not a real man of God you have little faith and need to seek God&#8217;s intervention in your lives.&#8221; True prophet or not, the EFF leader said it was not his place to judge, despite that he too went there to seek blessings from him. The &#8216;snakes pastor&#8217; made news in 2015 after pictures of him feeding snakes to his congregants emerged. In the pictures, a woman and a man could be seen eating the live snakes said to have tasted like chocolate. In the same year, he again made his congregants strip during the service before &#8220;commanding&#8221; the temperature to decrease into snow atmosphere . The congregation apparently started to feel cold in their bodies and covered themselves with blankets. During the same service, he reportedly commanded the &#8220;Spirit of Snakes&#8221; to enter the congregation. They then began slithering on the ground with their tongues out.
