Former Eskom interim CEO Collin Matjila s CV was allegedly passed on to the controversial Gupta family shortly before he was appointed to the helm of the beleaguered state-owned power utility in 2014. According to the latest revelations from the #GuptaLeaks, amaBhungane and Daily Maverick s Scorpio investigative unit reported on Wednesday that the family s associate, Salim Essa, on March 22, 2014, circulated Matjila s CV via email to Rajesh Tony Gupta and his nephew, Srikant Singhala, Atul Gupta s son. The CV was also sent to President Jacob Zuma s son, Duduzane a business partner of the family as well as an employee of the Guptas, who works for their company, Sahara Computers. Matjila was previously a member of the Eskom board at the time as a member of the board s tender subcommittee. He was appointed the power utility s acting CEO at the end of March that year following Brian Dames resignation. After Matjila was appointed, according to the report, Gupta-owned TNA Media (The New Age newspaper and ANN7) benefited from lucrative deals with Eskom. In October 2014, amaBhungane reported that &#8220;Matjila allegedly disregarded internal legal advice and approved a budget-busting R43-million New Age business breakfasts sponsorship . The business breakfasts, now reportedly being cancelled by the SABC, were regularly broadcast live on the state broadcaster at its expense. They featured prominent political figures, including President Jacob Zuma, the report stated. ALSO READ: Eskom: So many red flags it&#8217;s hard to know where to start
