Minister of Justice and Correctional Services Michael Masutha has denied allegations made by former ANC MP Vytjie Mentor that he dated a married woman. On Friday, Mentor shared on Facebook about a Judy, short for Judith, from Johannesburg, who joined parliament mid-term during Mentor s parliament days and was made to sit next to her in the chamber. This lady very soon dated Malusi Gigaba, and much later dated [Michael] Masutha as well, this even though she was married, Mentor alleged. However, the minister has denied the allegations, saying the claims made by Mentor were &#8220;entirely untrue&#8221;. &#8220;It is the minister&#8217;s view that such slandering should not be entertained in the media,&#8221; he said in a statement.
