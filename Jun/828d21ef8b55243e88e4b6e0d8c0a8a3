A video posted to Facebook from LiveLeak by South Africa Live on Saturday shows a burglar wasting his time quite pathetically. In the clip, the skelm goes to a lot of effort to gain access to a house without realising that all he&#8217;s doing is accessing a completely open property. It&#8217;s unclear what&#8217;s wrong with this house and why it&#8217;s built this way. One user speculated that it may have been shot on CCTV in Brakpan, though it could be anywhere in the world. Watch the fiend&#8217;s dejected reaction below, clear from his body language, when he realises what a complete fool he is.
