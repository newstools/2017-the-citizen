With the high rate of population growth, the country faces both challenges and opportunities in its development initiatives. A growing population already burdens the scarce social services such as health, education, infrastructure and such.He added: On the other hand, a growing population could also mean more human resources in different sectors of production, better innovativeness and creativity; enhance competition in service delivery and production.According to him the film competition is an excellent opportunity for young Tanzanians to creatively express themselves about a topic of great importance in Tanzania s pursuit for development.The European Youth Film Competition will take place in phases over a period of several months from the calls for proposal to the final ceremony.
