Socialite Khanyi Mbau has shed some light on her views on money and how she somehow always finds herself with a lot of it in a recent interview with Anele Mdoda on Real Talk. Mbau&#8217;s relationship with money started with her father and not the rich men she dated, she told Mdoda. Though her parents never married, her father, who was in the taxi business, was always part of her life. She said he would come to her mother&#8217;s house with a lot of it and just give it to her. &#8220;My dad was a taxi owner so he always had lots of money with him. And my dad was a typical Zulu man who did not know how to raise a child. All he felt was &#8216;just give her money and she&#8217;ll be happy&#8217;. &#8220;He always came to see me like a boyfriend. He would always park his car outside, I would come out of the gate and sit in the car with him. He&#8217;d bring me ice cream and toys; he would sit with me for like two hours and then drive away,&#8221; she said. When she visited him over the school holidays, he would make her and her sister Thandeka count the money taxi drivers brought home so they could get used to it. &#8220;He felt that if you&#8217;re surrounded by money and you see it in heaps, you will understand it; it will get used to you, you will get used to it. And it&#8217;s success for you to always have money in the palm of your hands. So he said to me: &#8216;Even if you&#8217;re not counting right, just count it.&#8217; So he would just dump the money in front of me and my sister Thandeka and say count,&#8221; she told Mdoda. This was the beginning of Mbau&#8217;s attraction to money, though she at some point found it in the hands of married businessman Theunis Crous. She said that she did not chase after it, contrary to popular belief. Money always chased after her. I have a relationship with money. I just think money recognises me, money is comfortable around me, money likes me, money feels like when it needs someone to talk to, it will choose me in the crowd, and it will come and sit next to me, whether it comes in a form of whatever, but it will choose me, she said.
