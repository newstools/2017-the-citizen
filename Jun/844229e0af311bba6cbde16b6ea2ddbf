The Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa) on Wednesday revealed its dossier on state capture allegations to oust President Jacob Zuma from power. Addressing a media briefing in Cape Town, the organisation s chairman Wayne Duvenage said it had taken Outa several months with a team of experienced investigators researchers and legal counsel to build the case document titled, No room to Hide: A President Caught in the Act. Duvenage said Outa would hand over the dossier which includes information on reports by the public protector, the SA Council of Churches and the Public Affairs Research Institute, as well as some of the leaked Gupta emails to National Assembly speaker Baleka Mbete and political parties with the view to requesting that it be tabled for discussion in parliament. Copies of the document would also be provided to the governing party s national executive committee, Police Minister Fikile Mbalula the Hawks, including the National Prosecuting Authority. However, Outa said it would contemplate turning to the Constitutional Court when convinced that it would meaningful to do so . The civil society organisation also believes the document would help MPs to to vote with their conscience in the upcoming motion of no confidence in Zuma after the Constitutional Court ruled last week that Mbete had the power to determine whether voting can be done by way of a secret ballot. Removing President Zuma from power is the primary step that needs to be taken before South Africa can start the journey of redressing the devastating effect that his conduct and the situation of state capture has had in our country, Duvenage said.
