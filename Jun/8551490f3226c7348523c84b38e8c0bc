The University of Stellenbosch has postponed Wednesday s examinations due to the storm expected to hit the cape. The university management said the rescheduling for the exams would be communicated on Wednesday. In light of the severe weather warnings issued by the South African Weather Service, and the related safety concerns, our university management decided to postpone all exams scheduled for Wednesday 7 June, acting rector and vice-chancellor Nico Koopman said on Tuesday. We have taken this decision in the interest of the safety of our staff and students. We trust that the situation will be back to normal by Thursday 8 June. This comes after the Western Cape government earlier announced that all schools in the province would be closed tomorrow. The drought-stricken Western Cape is expecting inclement weather from Tuesday night, with the provincial government advising residents to expect heavy rain leading to flooding, gale force coastal and interior winds, snowfalls, storm surges and high sea conditions. Disaster risk management teams and emergency services have been placed on full alert. &nbsp; ALSO READ: Cape coast residents prepare for monster storm and waves as high as 12 metres
