A 19-year-old rapist was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment by the Botshabelo Regional Court for rape, kidnapping and robbery, police said in a statement. South African Police Services spokesperson Brigadier Khothatso Ramokotjo said Teboho Steven Lebusho was given a further 30 years for robbery and three years kidnapping. It was on 7 May 2016 at about 20:00 when a couple was walking from Section C2 in Botshabelo to Section J in an open space next to Fairways in Botshabelo, Ramokotjo said. They met four African males that started beating up the husband, took the couple s phones and took the 34-year-old wife to a house in Section U. Ramokotjo said upon arriving at the house in Section U, the three African males left, leaving Lebusho behind with the 34-year-old victim. Lebusho raped the victim at his residential home in Section U. Victim was released the following day and she managed to open a case of rape, robbery and kidnapping. During court proceedings the accused confessed that he indeed raped the victim and he did not mention the names of the other three suspects that robbed and kidnapped the victim. The couple also did not manage to see the three suspects faces but they managed to testify that Lebusho did indeed attack them and robbed them of their cellphones, Ramokotjo said.
