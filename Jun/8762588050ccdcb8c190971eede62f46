If there is one thing the EFF&#8217;s leaders enjoy doing, it&#8217;s breaking out in song and dance. While addressing crowds at Boipatong in the Vaal, south of Johannesburg, Julius Malema and Floyd Shivambu joined performers who were entertaining the audience. The EFF held a youth rally to commemorate Youth Day. In his speech, Malema slammed corruption and blacks not supporting each other. &#8220;We must fight corruption. We must defeat corruption. When we say to people that he&#8217;s stealing, they don&#8217;t understand. The money that was meant for Boipatong, for the people in townships, Zuma took it to Dubai. &#8220;They say about youth today what they used to say about the youth of 76. You don&#8217;t need permission to fight corruption! Boipatong is important in history. We did not choose this place because we are bored. We are reminding government about you!&#8221; &#8220;We must create our own things! There&#8217;s nothing special about China, America, Europe! There&#8217;s everything special here! we are here to support the ideas of Black children. Not malls! Malls must fall! We want industries! We want factories.&#8221; Watch the videos below Deputy President, Floyd Shivambu in dance with Benny Mayengani! #EFFJune16 pic.twitter.com/4YdOpA92FE EFF Official Account (@EFFSouthAfrica) June 17, 2017 &nbsp; #EFF leader Julius Malema dancing on stage ahead of the #YouthDAY celebrations in Boipatong. pic.twitter.com/NcCx6qpuHq Iavan Pijoos (@Iavan13) June 16, 2017 READ MORE: WATCH: Malema explains what it would take to fix his relationship with Zuma For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
