Three non-governmental associations said Thursday that they had filed a lawsuit against BNP Paribas accusing the bank of &#8220;complicity&#8221; in the 1994 genocide of the Tutsi minority in Rwanda. The groups accuse the French bank of financing the purchase of &#8220;80 tonnes of arms used to carry out genocide&#8221; by the Hutu regime, even though &#8220;the bank had to have known the genocidal intentions of the country&#8217;s authorities.&#8221; BNP authorised the fund transfer to the regime in June 1994, the groups said in a statement, accusing the bank of &#8220;complicity in genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity&#8221;. A spokesman for the bank told AFP it could not comment on the claims, saying it did not yet have &#8220;sufficient details&#8221;. The lawsuit was filed in France by Sherpa, which defends victims of economic crimes; Ibuka France, a Rwanda victims&#8217; association; and the France-based Collective of Civil Parties for Rwanda, which pursues claims against genocide suspects. Kigali has repeatedly accused Paris of having a hand in the genocide and of being slow to prosecute some of its kingpins living in France.
