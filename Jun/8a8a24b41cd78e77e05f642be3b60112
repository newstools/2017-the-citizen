So heated was a back and forth argument between Sizwe and Vusi that it has been trending on Twitter the whole day. It all started when Sizwe posted tweets about the taxi industry and his opinion on the strike which nearly crippled the province on Thursday. In his tweets, Sizwe opined that taxi owners should formalise their industry by offering insurance and creating their own dealerships, effectively cutting out the middleman and building more wealth for themselves and the country. Vusi liked the tweets and in a separate post on Facebook, used information similar to Sizwe&#8217;s about the taxi industry and their lack of economic formalisation. See the video below in which Vusi quotes the statistic about the taxi industry buying 1200 taxis every month Sizwe was alerted to the post and began tweeting about how his posts were used and not referenced. This guy posted my entire thread as his thoughts&#8230; &mdash; Sizwe Dhlomo (@SizweDhlomo) June 16, 2017 Sizwe added that &#8216;this guy&#8217; had also gone on to brand an interview he had done with his producer as his own, again without referencing him. It&#39;s all good though&#8230; knowledge doesn&#39;t get depleted by getting shared @SaneleZondii. Bless him &amp; his hustle. &mdash; Sizwe Dhlomo (@SizweDhlomo) June 16, 2017 Though he didn&#8217;t mention any names, Vusi uploaded a video onto his Twitter, slamming Sizwe for calling him out. He said he could have contacted him to hash the issue out like men but instead he had &#8216;acted like a little girl&#8217; and posted on Twitter. Let&#39;s set the record straight https://t.co/FdIZwdBD5l &mdash; Vusi Thembekwayo (@VusiThembekwayo) June 17, 2017 The insults didn&#8217;t end there as Sizwe also had a few jabs. I know you like to see black people progress but doing it in a way that discredits you @VusiThembekwayo, only sets us back. &mdash; Sizwe Dhlomo (@SizweDhlomo) June 17, 2017 There is so much that&#39;s not my place to say because it would ruin people &amp; their livelihoods. Just know, cats aren&#39;t what they say they are. &mdash; Sizwe Dhlomo (@SizweDhlomo) June 17, 2017 Sizwe then went on to pull out a receipt, showing that his tweets were posted at least an hour before Vusi&#8217;s Facebook video. Don&#39;t lie bro @VusiThembekwayo, this is the original time stamp.
