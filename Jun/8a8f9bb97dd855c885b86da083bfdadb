We are aware that today&#8217;s youth face a different battle for the class of 1976, drug abuse, joblessness and lack of access to quality education are among some of the key challenges for young people today. For many democracy has not brought the milk and honey our forefathers fought so hard for, indeed 23 years after our first democratic elections in 1994, the youth largely are still chained to the ugly legacy of the past. Like the youth of June 16, 1976 today&#8217;s crop needs to and can chart their own destiny. #AlutaContinua #TheStruggleContinues A post shared by Basetsana Kumalo (@basetsanakumalo) on Jun 15, 2017 at 10:22pm PDT Salute to the Youth of 76, who paid the sacrifice so that I may enjoy the education that I did. #June16 #YouthDay A post shared by ProVerbMusic (@proverbmusic) on Jun 16, 2017 at 12:55am PDT &#x1f3fe; &#x1f1ff;&#x1f1e6; May we always remember and embrace the Power of joining hands to fight for what we deserve.
