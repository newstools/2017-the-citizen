Choreographer, radio and TV personality Somizi Mhlongo will be launching much-anticipated tell-all book Dominoes: Unbreakable Spirit tonight at a private party in Hyde Park, Johannesburg. The book talks about a terminal disease he has been living with since 1999, his first sexual encounter with a man and a period in his life when he was broke, among other things. The 44-year-old posted a video on his Instagram account this morning, in which he shares that he is nervous about the book launch happening tonight. Every time I do something big, whether it s an award show, reality show or whatever that I do, I get so scared and nervous. But my fear is different in a sense that it is fear out of respect for my craft, he says in the video. It is not fear about failure. Never ever give fear about failure power. More than anything, it is the combination of fear and bravery. Bravery will take you higher, bravery will make you that multimillionaire and the healthiest person because you have guts. The radio star says people who are brave are also scared, but the only difference is that they overcame their fear with bravery, something he encourages his followers to always do. &nbsp; Don&#8217;t let fear cripple yo potential Add a ton of bravery on it and ur good to be great A post shared by Somizi (@somizi) on Jun 28, 2017 at 12:53am PDT ALSO READ: Somizi details how he once paid R12k for an orgy
