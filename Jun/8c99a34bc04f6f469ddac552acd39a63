The 2017 Marie Claire naked issue is in stores, and once again features Mzansi celebrities who have chosen to strip to raise funds for charities of their choice. This year&#8217;s 19 celebs include chefs, TV and radio personalities, designers, models, athletes and entrepreneurs, who have since been campaigning for people to go buy the magazine and support their causes. The shoot took place in Cape Town and Joburg in May and features Nomzamo Mbatha on the cover. Her boyfriend, Maps Maponyane, has been publicly vouching for her, urging followers on social media to go buy the copy and support her cause. &#8220;The Marie Claire naked issue for charity is out, and it has a whole entire snack on the cover,&#8221; he wrote on Twitter.
