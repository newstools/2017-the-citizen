During this afternoon&#8217;s exclusive interview with Touch Central host Thabo Molefe, Julius Malema revealed the last time he had a meaningful conversation with President Jacob Zuma was as far back as May 2014. &#8220;Last time I spoke to him is after he [and ANC] won elections in 2014, which the EFF contested,&#8221; he said. He said earlier when he told Zuma they would meet in parliament, the president had laughed at him. &#8220;When I told him we will meet in parliament, he laughed and said we did not take anything from the ANC. But now I think he realised that someone is taking ANC votes,&#8221; he told Molefe. When asked if, when the time comes for him to step down from the EFF CIC position, he would do so willingly, Malema was cagey with his answer. &#8220;EFF constitution has no limit on the president. It is subjected to the willingness of people to elect you. Once the EFF say they are no longer want me in power, I will go,&#8221; he said. Malema agreed with a caller who said many people who received land battled to sustain themselves on it. &#8220;They [recipients] end up selling it to white people. They don t have money, and equally they don t have the tools to work the land. You have to give them all types of tools to work the land. &#8220;People are given land when there are cameras, but they are abandoned. They need tools to utilise the land,&#8221; he explained.
