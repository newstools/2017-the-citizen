Just over a week ago, there were doubts over what Imran Tahir&#8217;s impact in this year&#8217;s ICC Champions Trophy would be. England&#8217;s rampant top-order picked him with ease in the one-day series before he tweaked a hamstring. By the time the Proteas walked away with a 96-run win over Sri Lanka in their opening match at The Oval on Saturday, those doubts disappeared. The world&#8217;s second most influential bowler in ODIs produced a magnificent spell of 4/27, swinging the game decisively in South Africa&#8217;s favour. Chasing 300, Sri Lanka galloped to 94/1 in the 12th over as the new-ball pair of Kagiso Rabada and Wayne Parnell paid for their indiscipline. Then Tahir intervened. After captain AB de Villiers brilliant ran out Dinesh Chandimal earlier in the 18th over, he castled Chamara Kapugedera with a googly. He then had the Islanders&#8217; skipper Upul Tharana (57) caught at deep cover as well as dislodging the dangerous Asela Gunaratne. The cherry on top was his fourth &#8211; the last of scalp of the innings but by that time the Proteas had rammed home their advantage. Chris Morris was also influential in taking 2/32. Earlier, Hashim Amla spearheaded the Proteas&#8217; drive to 299/6. On a sunny London day, the bearded star paced his innings of 103 off 115 balls interestingly. He struggled initially against the new ball after South Africa were sent in, before accelerating in the middle and then tailing off to an extent again. Amla was eventually run out, frustratingly, by not grounding his bat properly though it also seemed as if he was tired. Nonetheless, it was a significant innings as he become the fastest man in ODI history to reach 25 hundreds. His knock mirrored the Proteas&#8217; batting effort. They started cautiously with Quinton de Kock struggling and eventually succumbing to some disciplined new ball bowling. But Faf du Plessis (75 off 70) batted beautifully and positively influenced Amla as they added 145 for the second wicket. However, a brilliant catch at midwicket to dismiss Du Plessis removed valuable momentum out of South Africa&#8217;s innings. Only JP Duminy&#8217;s unbeaten 38 off 20 gave South Africa some late impetus. For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
