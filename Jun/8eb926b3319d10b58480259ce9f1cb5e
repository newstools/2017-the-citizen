The son of a top PSL club owner and ex-soccer player, who cannot be named for legal reasons, has reportedly sold his Range Rover Sport for R785 000 so he could afford to pay the R200 000 monthly papgeld he owed to his wife. The former soccer star had been ordered to pay the money to the wife but only managed to pay for five months, after which he approached the court asking to be relieved of the monthly spousal maintenance order as he could not afford it anymore, reported Sunday World. The wife had reportedly demanded he pay towards the spousal maintenance for five years or until she remarries. But five months later, the ex-husband has pleaded poverty. According to court documents filed in the High Court in Johannesburg last week, the husband said his wife&#8217;s demands were four times his monthly income of R60 000, and accused her of concealing information about her income and assets to the court. He alleged the wife owned a R3 million property in a foreign country and that she exaggerated his worth and income in an attempt to have him jailed for defaulting on his maintenance. Though the wife had reportedly claimed the man received money from two companies in which he was a director, the ex-player admitted to being part of the entities but denied receiving financial compensation from them. He further reportedly told the court his assets were valued at R1.6 million and that the SA Revenue Service was demanding an immediate payment of close to R40 000 he owed. The ex-player further claimed he was &#8220;homeless&#8221; and that his father&#8217;s club had temporarily provided him with accommodation at one of the club&#8217;s apartments reserved for the club&#8217;s assistant coach.
