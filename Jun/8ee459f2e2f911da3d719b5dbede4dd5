Wednesday&#8217;s ICC Champions Trophy meeting between the Proteas and Pakistan in Birmingham was billed as a mismatch. There was a simple reason for that: South Africa are ranking No 1 in ODIs, their opponents scraped into the tournament in 8th position. By the time rain brought an early end to proceedings, the Proteas were reminded that rankings mean nothing as Pakistan cruised to a comfortable win by 19 runs on the Duckworth-Lewis method. It means AB de Villiers and his troops need to win Sunday&#8217;s match against India &#8211; and hope other results go their way &#8211; to progress to the semifinals. Now, South Africa could rightly say they ran into a Pakistan side that had one of those days where they were simply switched on. They were, at times, appalling in their first game against India and certainly went into this battle low on confidence. The transformation was remarkable. Pakistan&#8217;s varied and disciplined attack prospered on an already used pitch after the new one earmarked for this match wasn&#8217;t ready due to the weather. Still, it wasn&#8217;t an excuse for South Africa&#8217;s sluggish batting effort of 219/8. Quinton de Kock (33) and Hashim Amla (16) started cautiously and seemed to have the right approach only to forget that and both be trapped LBW by the spin twins of Imad Wasim (2/20) and Mohammed Hafeez (1/51). De Villiers was out first ball to a rash slap before Faf du Plessis&#8217; (26) wicket brought with it a game-changing spell from seamer Hasan Ali. The 23-year-old is not known to the Proteas but he is now following a brilliant haul of 3/24. After bowling Du Plessis, he set up JP Duminy beautifully outside off before the left-hander edged to slip and then castled Wayne Parnell with a magnificent delivery that straightened. At 118/6 in the 29th over, South Africa needed attacking players in David Miller and Chris Morris to play within themselves. And Miller in particular did that superbly as he ended on an unbeaten 75 off 104. It was hardly an exciting knock but exactly the maturity his side needed. Kagiso Rabada (26 off 23) provided handy support. Parnell&#8217;s poor day continued as he conceded 16 runs off his first two overs, exactly when the Proteas needed to keep the runs down. At least the experienced Morne Morkel (3/18) reminded all of his worth with a superb spell. First he had debutant opener Fakhar Zaman (31 off 23) caught at slip with a shrewd off-cutter before Azhar Ali gifted him a wicket with flick to third man. He returned to bounce out Hafeez (26) but received virtually no support as Pakistan (119/3) got ahead of the rate when the rain came.
