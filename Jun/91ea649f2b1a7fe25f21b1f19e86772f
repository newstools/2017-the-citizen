He has no anger issues and the idea that he is a dirty player is only a perception and far-fetched, insists fiery Springbok lock Eben Etzebeth. The beast of a man, who stands at 2.04m and weighs 117kg, is considered an enforcer and the man to create the spark in the Bok engine-room. And those sparks could indeed fly in the first Test against France at Loftus Versfeld on Saturday. Also read: New Springboks still embrace a dirty phrase &#8220;I enjoy the physical part of the game but in all my games for the Stormers and Western Province (over six seasons), I have only received two yellow cards,&#8221; said Etzebeth, who at only 25 has already amassed 54 Bok Test caps since his 2012 debut against England. &#8220;I think I control my anger well enough and hopefully again on Saturday, but I will have seven other forwards around me who will also help me.&#8221; Etzebeth has often been caught in the middle of a scuffle, earning him the reputation of a fighter rather than a player. Yet despite his obvious short fuse, the Stormers vice-captain is adamant his priorities on the field are right. I think it s a (wrong) perception that I m a dirty player and not something I really take too much notice of, he said. Instead, Etzebeth is steadily trying to show his worth as a leader. Leadership and Eben Etzebeth is not two words often one would even imagine using in the same sentence. But he says he enjoys the added responsibility. &#8220;I enjoy a leadership role and I ve had the privilege to captain the Stormers on a few occasions this year,&#8221; said Etzebeth. &#8220;And now being at the Boks and part of the leadership group is a massive responsibility and I m glad to form part of that.&#8221; He&#8217;s also more than willing to assist new Bok captain Warren Whiteley in cultivating a strong team culture. &#8220;I think last year in Adriaan Strauss we had a tremendous captain and this year again in Warren. They both knew what they had to do and they are both incredible leaders and we as a team follow them. But there s also a leadership core around the captain which helps.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
