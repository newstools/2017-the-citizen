To date, deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa has been endorsed by Cosatu, NUM and the Northern Cape’s provincial ANC leadership.
Individuals who have also stepped forward to support Ramaphosa include education minister Angie Motshekga, Cosatu’s president Sdumo Dlamini, former finance minister Pravin Gordhan and former KZN premier Senzo Mchunu.
Secretary-general Gwede Mantashe and treasurer-general Zweli Mkhize are two high level officials who have openly expressed their support for Ramaphosa.
According to Sunday Times, Maneli said he saw no issue with Ramaphosa succeeding Zuma as tradition in the ANC had dictated.
“On the issue of the deputy president automatically ascending to the top‚ we have no problem with that. The comrade is a good leader. We have subjected him to the Eye of the Needle.”
Maneli was addressing the regional general council of the ANC West Rand and added that Sisulu should be elected to the top six leadership within the party. He said she and others could be led by Ramaphosa.
