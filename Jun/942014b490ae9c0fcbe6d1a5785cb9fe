The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) has announced that a protected strike at Msobo Coal mine in Mpumalanga that started on Tuesday, has come to end after the company withdrew its letter of resignation from the Chamber of Mines. The NUM embarked on a protected strike at Msobo Coal mine after the company withdrew from the centralised bargaining forum by the Chamber of Mines. Coal companies including Anglo American Coal, Msobo Coal, Delmas Coal, Exxaro Coal Mpumalanga, Kangra Coal, Koornfontein Mines and Glencore indicated in 2016 that they intended to negotiate wages, and terms and conditions of employment on a decentralised basis with effect from this year. NUM chief negotiator in the coal sector, Peter Bailey, said the company s withdrawal of its letter of resignation from the Chamber of Mines was a victory for workers. Workers have achieved what they wanted. I can confirm Msobo Coal has withdrawn its letter of resignation from the Chamber of Mines. Workers will report to work tomorrow at 6am, Bailey said. The purpose of the NUM strike was to compel Msobo Coal and its management to comply with the recommendations of the advisory award, and to align itself with the process of wage negotiations that is currently ongoing at the Chamber. In December last year, the NUM went on a protected strike at Msobo Coal mine after the company issued workers with section 189 retrenchment notices a year before and consultation broke down at the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA).
