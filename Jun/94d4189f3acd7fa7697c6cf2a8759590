Kiernan &#8216;AKA&#8217; Forbes received a backlash on Sunday after going to the Mzansi Hip Hop Festival festival he was booked for in Kempton Park, but when he arrived, he sat in his car for an hour, then left without performing. Event promoter Vuzokuhle Nala told The Sowetan they were in talks with AKA&#8217;s management to recover R200 000 in his performance fees and charges for hospitality requirements. All artists, including Kwesta and Cassper Nyovest, were reportedly paid their full performance fees and performed as arranged. But the All Eyes On Me hit maker refused to perform, saying it was written into his contract that he had the right to not render his services to a crowd of fewer than 500 people and still keep the money. Musician Ntukza took to Twitter to address the issue with AKA, insisting he was wrong for ditching a sold-out show even when he had been paid, a claim AKA disputed, saying he had pictures to prove there were no more than 500 people at the event. There wasn&#39;t enough people for me to perform. 500 minimum. It&#39;s in my contract. https://t.co/ss3pFQapqX &mdash; AKA (@akaworldwide) June 3, 2017 AKA said he made an arrangement with the organiser to go back and perform at the same event, after his other show at Nasrec, should they fill up the venue, but he never got the call. &#8220;Come on, man. We even said, we can come back later if the place gets full. I even said I would make a plan for the next show. No extra charge,&#8221; he told the musician. The problem with performing for a small crowd, according to the rapper, was that people had a tendency of calling it &#8220;AKA&#8217;s show&#8221; when it was just a booking. Though the clause was in his contract, some felt he was wrong for ditching the event, as his fans waited for him in the cold, only for him to walk away. Some, however, supported him, saying the Supa Mega respected his craft, and was right in refusing to settle for less.
