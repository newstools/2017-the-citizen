This week&#8217;s issue of Drum Magazine features king of Kwaito Arthur Mafokate and his daughters on its cover and Twitter is really not impressed. The magazine wrote: &#8220;Arthur: My life, my girls and that abuse incident,&#8221; further quoting him as saying he wouldn&#8217;t &#8220;want someone to hurt one of my daughters&#8221;, which paints him as a good family man. To dismiss the serious charges against him as &#8220;that abuse incident&#8221; also came across as quite weird for many. Check out the cover below: On shelves now!

Mafokate allegedly dragged her on the street with his car during an argument after receiving a phone call from another woman while they were in the bedroom. He was released on R500 bail. &#8220;What editorial choice motivated to feature someone facing claims of abuse? Just curious,&#8221; some on Twitter have asked. Mafokate may have not been found guilty of the crime but Drum magazine made a bad decision in using him and his daughters when his case was still pending. It showed that the magazine disregarded women&#8217;s safety, argued Twitter. Now they are calling for a magazine boycott due to it being &#8220;insensitive&#8221;. These were some of the reactions on Twitter: &#8220;At a time when not a day goes by without a female dying at the hands of abusive men, your article on Arthur sure must be some milestone, huh?&#8221; &#8220;Are you guys endorsing abuse against women? Why offer an abuser the platform to excuse his behaviour?&#8221; &#8220;Your punchline &#8216;The magazine that support Abusers&#8217; If you really wanted a story, you could&#8217;ve at least dedicated any page to him not front page.&#8221; &#8220;Ohhwww wooow @DrumMagazine really? Yhuuu women go through the most and nina nibusy &#8216;painting a diff picture&#8217; to the whole situation.&#8221; &#8220;I am so done buying Drum! You should talk to the victim and not the perpetrator. Doing damage control for Mafokate?&#8221; &#8220;What a Mess. Always giving the abuser a platform to show &#8216;how good of a person&#8217; they are. This is disgusting when women are dying.&#8221; The magazine has not responded to the criticism.
