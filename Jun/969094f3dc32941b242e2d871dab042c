New Proteas Test opener, Heino Kuhn, plans to keep the same mindset and approach that has brought him success in the upcoming four-match series against England starting next week. His call-up comes on the back of two successful seasons for the Titans and more recently for South Africa A against the England Lions, where he finished as the standout performer in a disappointing series.

He has waited a long time for the call-up and in the process has scored nearly 10 000 runs with a high-score of 244 not out. Rather late than never, the 33-year-old said of his selection. I have matured a lot over the years as a batter and as a cricketer. I believe everything happens for a reason and maybe five years ago wasn t my time. I m happy to be here and I m looking forward to this challenge. I m going to try and approach it like I do with every game, he explained. I know there is going to be a bit more pressure, especially if I make my debut, but it will be important to see it like it s any other game. Opening the batting everywhere is quite tough but it is a lot more challenging in South Africa and England. My job is to take the newness off the ball. I ll have to try and leave as well as I can, know where my off-stump is and take it from there. The Test squad began their preparation for the three-day warm-up match against England Lions with a light training session at New Road in Worcester on Tuesday. The match, which starts on Thursday, will carry first-class status. For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
