The major concern for the South African national cricket team is not so much that they lost the T20 International series to England, but where to from here with just more than a week before the start of the Test series? The timing of the T20 series nestled between the Champions Trophy and the Test series didn t make sense from the get-go. They should have scheduled it for the start or at the end of the tour, not before the Tests. As it stands, South Africa have only managed three wins in nine matches on tour six one-day internationals and three T20s. Their coach. Russell Domingo, is back home after his mother was involved in an accident and their captain, Faf du Plessis, could miss the first Test at Lord s from next Thursday due to the anticipated birth of his first-born. The Proteas were poor in the Champions Trophy, and other than some resistance in the second T20 on Friday, they were outplayed in the three-match series. So ahead of the four Tests, is there any hope the Proteas can turn their fortunes around? They ve added some new faces in the squad for the Test series after including Heino Kuhn, Aiden Markram and Andile Phehlukwayo yesterday. It s doubtful the trio will be rushed in for the first Test, but fresh ideas could just be what the doctor ordered.
