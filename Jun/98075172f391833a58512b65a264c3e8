Choreographer and radio personality Somizi Mhlongo will launch his tell-all book, titled Dominoes: Unbreakable Spirit, at a private event on Wednesday night. In his book, Somizi details his first sexual encounter with a man, an orgy he once went to and a sexual assault case brought against him in 2007, among other racy anecdotes. On the day of his father&#8217;s funeral, Somizi reveals in snippets published by The Sowetan that he ended up in bed with a well-known musician and his girlfriend. He says the encounter made him aware of &#8220;certain feelings&#8221; he had never experienced before. &#8220;My heart throbbing and loins on fire, the scent of a man and the prickly hairy legs fired me up. We fondled. I was actually the one touching him, and he touched me back, sending me into a tizz of ecstasy,&#8221; he is quoted as saying. The book further details how a kwaito star friend of his took him to a club in Hillbrow, where a Nigerian man took them to an apartment full of girls. &#8220;It was an orgy. People were having sex and taking drugs, and champagne was flowing.&#8221; Somizi did not really see much of what happened that night, as he says he took a glass of champagne and passed out from exhaustion after having just travelled back from Port Elizabeth. He says when he woke up, people demanded that he pay a R12 000 bill. After asking what it was for, as he only took one glass of champagne, he says they told him it was for the artist and the girls. He further details a 2007 sexual assault case brought against him by a &#8220;stranger&#8221; he had given a lift. The two went to Somizi&#8217;s house, had a few beers and &#8220;fondled&#8221; each other. &#8220;He climaxed, then he said, please take me home,&#8221; Somizi writes. He was found guilty by a Randburg court, and had to pay a fine. ALSO READ: Somizi says he has HIV, cancer or diabetes
