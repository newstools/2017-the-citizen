Police Minister Fikile Mbalula has, in a series of tweets on Saturday, lashed out at former finance minister Trevor Manuel for his statement that the notion of &#8220;white monopoly capital&#8221; was misguided. City Press reported on Sunday on a talk given by Manuel at the Nelson Mandela Foundation that the alternative for those who were fighting WMC was Indian monopoly capital out of Saxonwold . He was quoted as saying that the best alternative was how we build an inclusive economy . White monopoly capital doesn t exist other than what has been generated by [British PR agency] Bell Pottinger, he said. The longest-serving finance minister in South Africa s history also gave insight into how the relationship with ratings agencies had been maintained during the Mandela era. He said agencies needed to feel a sense of trust in leaders and policy must be predictable, and I think that is a discontinuity we have at the moment . However, the police minister said Manuel did not have the right to speak against &#8220;capture&#8221; when he was &#8220;drowning&#8221; in being &#8220;captured&#8221; himself. &#8220;No wonder her can&#8217;t see its existence,&#8221; he said. In fact, it was difficult for Manuel to understand white monopoly capital when his household earnings were over R100 million annually, Mbalula further alleged. &#8220;Trevor is also yet to explain how Absa, where his better half serves as CEO, admitted to rand/currency manipulation,&#8221; he added. Manuel needed political education, which was dismissed too soon for him. If not, he would have known the ANC had always been clear on who has control over the economy. &#8220;What I expected was for him to substantiate his claim that monopoly capital is a figment of our imagination and an invention of some people.&#8221; His comment on the Guptas was just a deflection from the real debate about who really owned the economy, he said. Manuel further needed to explain why 90% of the country&#8217;s wealth was in the hands of the minority. &#8220;Will Trevor also explain the recent reaction by corporate SA intervening on Knysna yet always ignore Khayelitsha when it goes up in flames? &#8220;Trevor is such a drama queen. Leaves the whole debate on monopoly capital and deflects with the usual Guptanoma,&#8221; he said. Also read: Trevor Manuel says &#8216;white monopoly capital&#8217; is nonsense
