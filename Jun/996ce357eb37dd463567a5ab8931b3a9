The Proteas&#8217; tour of England isn&#8217;t on the verge of unraveling &#8230; if you believe Farhaan Behardien. But the threat really does look real going into Friday evening&#8217;s second T20 in Taunton. Should South Africa lose, this quick series &#8211; it concludes on Sunday &#8211; will be down the drain and complete another sorry chapter on this trip. Also read: Thoughtless Proteas smashed by ruthless England They&#8217;ve already lost the ODI series too and were eliminated early in the ICC Champions Trophy. &#8220;Look, the tour has been a tour,&#8221; said Behardien. &#8220;We&#8217;ve played some good cricket in patches. The real disappointment has been being knocked out of the Champions Trophy. We haven&#8217;t played to our potential.&#8221; Various observers and fans believe the Proteas need a positive series result to give the Test side confidence going into next month&#8217;s four-match battle. In other words, this T20 series has to &#8220;save&#8221; the tour. Behardien though is reluctant to view it that way. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t say it&#8217;s a chance to resurrect the tour. We&#8217;re going to try our best to win the series, we&#8217;re going to come hard,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got to lick our wounds and get up and go. The guys are eager to perform.&#8221; However, one could be forgiven for wondering exactly how motivated the Proteas are. Despite being thoroughly outplayed by England in Wednesday&#8217;s nine-wicket loss, South Africa didn&#8217;t help their cause with an uninspired performance in the field. &#8220;The way we ended the game was a bit disappointing,&#8221; said Behardien. &#8220;Even I dropped a catch late on. It&#8217;s something I never want to do on a cricket field. We&#8217;re realistic about what happened. England won with over five overs to spare. That&#8217;s a hiding in the T20 format. As much as we wanted to keep our energy, the game had already drifted away. It&#8217;s difficult to motivate yourself then.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
