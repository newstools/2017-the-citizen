A 28-year-old man from Section F in the Botshabelo township in the Free State was sentenced to life imprisonment for the rape of a 12-year-old girl, police said on Monday. The suspect, Nkosinathi Zoyikwa, was sentenced in the Botshabelo Regional Court on Thursday last week for the incident that occurred on September 16 last year. Police spokesman, Sergeant Martin Xuma, said the little girl was walking past Zoyikwa s home at around 7pm when the suspect approached her and asked her to go to a nearby shop to buy a cool drink. As the victim got back she realised that the accused is no longer at the gate and went into his shack to give him his cool drink. As she was about to go out of the shack the accused grabbed her, pushed her to the bed and forcefully raped her, said Xuma. Zoyikwa paid the girl R200,00 and threatened to kill her if she told anyone. According to police, the little girl s mother learned of the incident from a community member a month later and reported the matter to police. Xuma said statements taken from the victim, her mother and the community member played a vital role in the investigation as there was no DNA evidence or witnesses.
