It&#8217;s highly unlikely that Allister Coetzee is still facing the axe as Springbok coach after the early series win over France. Yet even if he still did, the 54-year-old mentor insists he has nothing to prove anyway. &#8220;I don&#8217;t have critics,&#8221; Coetzee said on Monday with a small smirk on his face. Also read: Workaholic Siya Kolisi shows his Springbok pedigree &#8220;There&#8217;s only one party&#8217;s approval I strive for and that&#8217;s The Almighty. I&#8217;ve signed a four-year contract with the South African Rugby Union (Saru). Any head coach of an international side knows what he&#8217;s letting himself in for. You are judged on certain things.&#8221; Reports of Coetzee being fired should the current series have gone sour had already surfaced by the end of last year. However, the upward trajectory of the Springboks&#8217; results in 2017 makes that seem like nothing more than a vicious rumour. Instead, team management can now focus on building a proper head of steam over the next two years before the 2019 World Cup. &#8220;The thing I&#8217;m really pleased about is that the memory of 2o16 is now dead and buried,&#8221; said Coetzee. &#8220;We&#8217;ve moved on. It&#8217;s just great to see what&#8217;s happening now. We&#8217;re not here to prove anything to anyone. All we want is the comfort that our hard work is paying off. Yes, mistakes were made. But we now know there&#8217;s scope for those mistakes to be set right.&#8221; The Springboks&#8217; more balanced and composed play to date in the series against the French definitely suggests better coaching and clearer thought. But Coetzee is reluctant to take credit for the turnaround. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got a great team environment going here, a fantastic leadership group headed by a great captain,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Everyone&#8217;s bought into the plan and it&#8217;s looking good. Last year in Durban (after the Springboks lost 15-57 to the All Blacks) we were booed off the field. Less than a year later, they&#8217;ve cheered for us. The credit must go to the players for unselfishly buying into this vision.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter. Would you like to place a rugby bet?
