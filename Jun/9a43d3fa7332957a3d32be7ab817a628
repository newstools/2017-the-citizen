Durban residents are set to step into action by participating in The Association for the Aged s (Tafta) annual awareness walk in solidarity against abuse of the elderly. Tafta encourages the community to show its support for the elderly by donning purple and joining the Elder Abuse Awareness Walk on Tuesday, June 13, Berea Mail reported. The walk starts at the Durban City Hall at 9.30am, and serves to commemorate World Elder Abuse Awareness Day on June 15. It forms part of Tafta s Do the Right Thing campaign an initiative to highlight the plight of the elderly and advocate for their rights. According to the South African Human Rights Commission, three percent of the complaints received during the last financial year were alleged violations on the grounds of age. However, a large percentage of elder abuse and neglect goes unreported. The elderly are often the most forgotten and neglected members of society facing physical, psychological and even financial abuse. Therefore, it is essential to refocus people s attention to the needs of the elderly because the welfare and protection of every vulnerable person is a shared responsibility, said Tafta CEO Femada Shamam. She said each person has parents, grandparents and other elders, who are an important part of our lives, and Tafta invites the public to take a stand in honour of these loved ones, remembering that not every person is treated with care, respect and dignity in their old age. Committed to the wellbeing and security of the elderly, Tafta has remained at the forefront of the fight against elder abuse and neglect, and addresses issues related to population ageing and elder care through awareness programmes.
