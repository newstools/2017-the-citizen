President Jacob Zuma&#8217;s wife, Thobeka Madiba-Zuma, has shared a picture of herself serving her husband food at their home, and offered a few words of advice on marriage. The first lady has, in the past, said that her marriage has not been a smooth ride since meeting her husband when she was 21, though the troubles have only strengthened her love for her husband. We have been through many, many storms and lived in different cities, yet our love has stood the test of time. After all these years, I m still in love with you, she said at the time. Now she has again shared a few words of advice they have followed to keep their marriage strong for more than 24 years. In an Instagram post, she wrote: &#8220;Wives, submit to your own husbands, as to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church, his body, and is himself its Savior. Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit in everything to their husbands. &#8220;Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her, that he might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word.&#8221; A post shared by TMZF Founder &amp; Patron (@firstladytzuma) on Jun 24, 2017 at 8:19am PDT Those who commented on her post thanked her for &#8220;setting a good example&#8221;. &#8220;I just love the way you treat him. We have to continue to be wives and not knives to our husbands, especially when they are dealing with a lot out there,&#8221; said one of her followers. &#8220;They should know and feel safe and look forward to coming home, where they are treated like kings.&#8221; Also read: I&#8217;m still in love with you, says Zuma&#8217;s wife
