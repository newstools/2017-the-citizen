It may have not been a perfect performance, but it certainly was effective as the South African cricket team started the Champions Trophy in England on a high on Saturday. The Proteas beat Sri Lanka by 96 runs at The Oval in their opening Pool B match, giving them a much needed confidence boost as they seek to reverse a horrible record at major limited overs tournaments. AB de Villiers men were far from clinical, but the considerable margin of victory will stand South Africa in good stead in a tournament where net run rates could come into play with rain around. South Africa stuttered with the bat at the start and end of their innings, while their bowlers were put to the sword by the Sri Lankan openers before they ripped through the top and middle order to secure the game. Veteran batsman Hashim Amla once again underlined his class with a match-winning hundred his 25th while leg-spinner Imran Tahir highlighted why he is such a powerful weapon for his country as he finished with bowling figures of 4/27 as the islanders were rolled for 203. With tricky clashes against Pakistan and India lying in wait for South Africa this week, it was the perfect tonic to settle the nerves. Go, South Africa, the country is behind you.
