Following her slayage at the BET Awards over the weekend, presenter Nomzamo Mbatha has sent messages of gratitude to her fans who watched the awards and commended her on a job well done. She was the co-host of the pre-recorded international awards ceremony that was aired on Tuesday night in South Africa, and her performance, along with her outfits, have been the talk of the Twitter streets since.

Maps has really been cheering for his girl on social media, making sure everyone knew he was proud of her for her gig at the BET Awards. He also shared a picture of the Marie Claire naked issue cover, which features his girlfriend on the cover, and called her a &#8220;whole snack&#8221;. Nomzamo noticed the support, and showed her appreciation. &#8220;Shoutout to the number one hypeBeast @MapsMaponyane &#8230; how you allow my shine and protect my light is commendable.
