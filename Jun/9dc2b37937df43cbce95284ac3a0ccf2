Brian Molefe s stint as Eskom chief executive officer officially came to an end on Friday, just three weeks after he was reappointed to the post, the power utility s board confirmed. The decision comes after an interministerial committee resolved to ask the Eskom board to reverse its decision to reappoint him. Public Enterprises Minister, Lynne Brown, in her role as government shareholder of Eskom, then directed the board to rescind their decision. The Eskom Board has, this [Friday] morning, given effect to the Minister s directive to rescind its decision to re-instate Mr. Brian Molefe as Group Chief Executive (GCE) of Eskom, the board said in a statement. In consequence, Mr. Molefe is no longer the Group Chief Executive of Eskom and will no longer serve as a director on the Board of Eskom.
