Russell Domingo has 48 hours to re-apply for his Proteas position. In an advert placed on Cricket South Africa&#8217;s (CSA) website, it states that the closing date for applications are Friday, 16 June. But South Africa&#8217;s mentor still hasn&#8217;t decided whether he wants to. Also read: AB de Villiers: We love Russell Domingo as our coach &#8220;Not yet,&#8221; was his response on the question whether he&#8217;ll submit his CV. When pressed for an indication of whether he plans do to say, Domingo merely replied: &#8220;I can&#8217;t say&#8221;. The 42-year-old&#8217;s employment has been one of the biggest themes this year after CSA announced in January they would be advertising his post. In May, the governing body finalised the process by appointing a five-man panel &#8211; which includes former Proteas coaches Gary Kirsten and Eric Simons &#8211; to set up a shortlist. CSA are following due process in order to protect themselves administratively. Domingo&#8217;s contract which expires in August has already been extended three times in the past four years. As a result, CSA can t risk doing so a fourth time because that could create the impression Domingo s contract lasting indefinitely. CSA CEO Haroon Lorgat has continually insisted they&#8217;re merely complying with South African labour law. For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
