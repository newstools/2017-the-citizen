Cricket fans wondering what Proteas leg-spinner Imran Tahir s exuberant wicket celebrations are all about, will just have to carry on guessing. Because he s not quite sure himself. Tahir s excitement hit new highs during his Man-of-the Match performance in South Africa s 96-run win against Sri Lanka in their opening Champions Trophy match at The Oval on Saturday.

Asked afterwards what is going through his mind during those moments, he replied: &#8220;I m not really sure myself what I m thinking of at the time.&#8221; &#8220;All I can say, is that I enjoy myself out there. It was a dream come true for me obviously to be selected to play international cricket. I m still living the dream playing for this great team and representing South Africa is not easy,&#8221; the Pakistani-born Tahir said. &#8220;I m trying to give everything I got in me this country and the team. I like to enjoy my cricket and that probably explains where I end up at the end of celebrating a wicket. But when I start the celebration, it s safe to say I don t know what I m going to be doing.&#8221; The leggie had another reason to smile on Saturday. Not renowned for being the best fielder in the side, he ran Suranga Lakmal out with a direct hit from mid-on. &#8220;We do quite a lot of training in the field and it s nice to see that now I ve got a run out in my pocket too,&#8221; he said. The Proteas take on Pakistan in their second match at Edgbaston on Wednesday, after which they conclude the group stage against India at the Oval.
