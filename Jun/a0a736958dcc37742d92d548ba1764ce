Economically disadvantaged pupils at Laezonia Primary School in Erasmia, Pretoria, got a pleasant surprise on Thursday when teams of police officers arrived at their school with goodies and necessities including food parcels. Police officers from the Tshwane west policing cluster, led by their commander, Major-Gen Daniel Mthombeni dedicated the day to interacting and uplifting the needy learners. The school has admitted some poorest children and some are orphans. Most of the parents are unemployed. These leaners are from the informal settlement and some come from child headed families with no basic needs, said spokesperson for the South African Police Service s Tshwane west cluster, Captain Augustinah Selepe. More than 1200 toiletry packs, food parcels and much more were distributed to kids. Major General Anna Mateisi, a champion of the Gauteng provincial Women s Network applauded Tshwane west policing cluster for reaching out to the needy learners. It takes a village to raise a child. Who is that village? Teachers are the first to build the foundation, teachers lay foundation, develop a child, today we are who we are because of them. We occupied these professions because we went to school to get that foundation from teachers. But we as parents build the village, to guide, protect and the children, said Mateisi.
