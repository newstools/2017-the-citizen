Diversified metals and mining company South32 on Thursday awarded a three-year core mining contract worth R158 million to a Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment company, Modi Mining, at its Wolvekrans Middleburg coalmine in Mpumalanga. Modi Mining will work closely with the Wolvekrans mining and planning teams to plan and deliver various sub-processes, including top soiling and stripping overburden. Modi Mining renders differentiated contract mining services, including supplying specialised services for both underground and surface operations. It provides contract mining, sweepings and vamping, underground construction, rail installations, services pipes installations, power cable suspension and box front installations, among others. Modi Mining was founded 10 years ago and is co-owned by mining engineer and entrepreneur Samuel Molefi, and woman entrepreneur Kebareng Moagi. South32 president and COO for Africa Region Mike Fraser said transformation was central to their efforts to make a meaningful contribution to the social and economic development of South Africa. Fraser said the award was particularly significant, as it was the first core-mining contract awarded to a 100% black-owned company. It marks a significant step forward in our plans to deliver a more inclusive supplier landscape, Fraser said. We welcome Modi Mining as a strategic mining partner of South32. We are impressed with their focus on safety, their commitment to continuous improvement, and their support for the local communities in which they operate. We look forward to working together to successfully deliver our projects at Wolvekrans. Modi Mining has also committed to creating downstream opportunities for local labour and subcontracting, aiming to source 80% to 90% of their labour from the nearby local communities.
