Matshela Koko, suspended acting Eskom CEO and group executive of coal procurement, lied on camera when he said during a Carte Blanche interview that he had never signed a deal with a Gupta-linked company. The Sunday Times reports Koko&#8217;s apparent dishonesty prompted Eskom board spokesperson Khulani Qoma to write a scathing letter to the board, in which he said Koko must be fired because &#8220;lying on camera is a cardinal sin for an executive, and recent memory doesn&#8217;t rival this particular incident&#8221;. Qoma confirmed to the publication that he wrote the letter in which he further stated: &#8220;According to the emails, he started bidding for the Gupta family while he was employed at Transnet and has allegedly migrated with this mandate to Eskom. I haven&#8217;t personally seen any credible effort by him [Koko], to refute these grave allegations.&#8221; According to the publication, the Cliffe Dekker Hofmeyr investigation into Koko found prima facie evidence of wrongdoing. The report seems to concur with widespread media allegations that &#8220;the power utility awarded contracts worth more than R1 billion to a company associated with his stepdaughter, Koketso Choma&#8221;. It is understood the report, first handed to the inquorate board of four members and then handed to the bolstered board, &#8220;recommended &#8230; a hearing, and said all contracts Eskom awarded to Impulse International after [Koketso] Choma joined the company should be investigated&#8221;. ALSO READ: How acting Eskom CEO s stepdaughter s firm was awarded tenders worth R1 billion The report apparently agreed that Koko &#8220;tried to lie to them [investigators] about the extent to which Choma was involved with Impulse International&#8221;. It also found that on March 22, 2016, and merely two days after the company appointed Choma as an executive director, the power utility awarded Impulse International a R63-million contract. Astonishingly, the paper said investigators discovered that &#8220;most of the contracts Eskom awarded to Impulse International were on an emergency basis or without a bidding process or proper tender regulations&#8221;. Impulse International CEO Pragasen Pather is quoted as having said: &#8220;You ruined my business, carry on writing what you want,&#8221; while Koko referred all media queries to &#8220;Cliffe Dekker Hofmeyr and Eskom for the outcome of the investigation&#8221;. In a related matter, weekend media reports indicated Chwayita Madikane, an alleged Gupta ally, was left out of the Eskom board in what some believe to be public enterprises minister Lynne Brown&#8217;s last-ditch attempt to rid state-owned entities of Gupta-linked board members.
