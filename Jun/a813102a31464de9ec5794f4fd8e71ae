It seems parenting is taking its toll on EFF leader Julius Malema since the birth of his son, Munzhedzi. In October last year, Malema and his wife, Mantwa, welcomed baby Munzhedzi to the world. Taking to Instagram, Malema posted a picture of himself with his wife and called Mma Munzhedzi (Munzhedzi s mother). Seven months later Malema has complained about the sleepless nights he has been having because of the young fighter who just wants to play. He took to social media to complain about the experience. In Sepedi, he wrote: &#8220;Go ba motswet i ke mathata, o ka se robale. Batho ba ge o, a ke Bopate le ga nyane. Mmaweee yeses, not complaining (being a parent is a problem. You won&#8217;t sleep. My good people, I hardly get any sleep! yeses, not complaining).&#8221; Most of his followers laughed at Malema, with actor Rami Chuene telling him that compared to his wife, his situation was better because he did not breastfeed, hence it was easy for men to forget about the experience and go on to have another baby. Radio presenter Redi Tlhabi shared her own experience, saying she had not slept for more than four hours since her baby&#8217;s birth. &#8220;Your body will adjust &#8230;I think,&#8221; she told Malema. Responding to Tbo Touch in a recent interview, Malema said at home he was nothing like the EFF leader we&#8217;ve seen in parliament. He was a husband and ensured that his home was peaceful. Though we will never see him in action, Malema said when he gets home every day after a busy day, he plays with his son and rolls on the carpet, just like any normal father. In fact, his son loved him more than his mother, he said. Also read: Malema reveals a side of him you didn&#8217;t know &nbsp;
