Taking a blow in his comeback from injury, Kevin Anderson bowed out during his fourth-round match at the French Open on Monday. After losing the first set 6-3 against Croatian seventh seed Marin Cilic, the South African player was 3-0 down in the second set when he called it quits. While the tournament organisers confirmed he had picked up an injury, details of the niggle were unclear. Bouncing back from a rocky period which had seen him sidelined by multiple injuries and minor ankle surgery, Anderson had reached the last 16 of a Grand Slam event for the first time since the 2015 season. His withdrawal brought an end to SA&#8217;s run in the main draw at Roland Garros after Raven Klaasen was eliminated from the second round of the men&#8217;s and mixed doubles divisions, having paired up with American player Rajeev Ram and Slovenian Katarina Srebotnik.
