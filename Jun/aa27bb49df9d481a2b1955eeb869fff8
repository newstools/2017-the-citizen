The owner of a Sodwana Bay, northern KwaZulu-Natal, guesthouse, Andre Slade is reported to have shot his 26-year-old neighbour, who later succumbed to his injuries at a local clinic, in March. Slade&#8217;s comments concerning race and religion last year made headlines after he refused a customer permission to stay at his establishment because he did not allow blacks and government employees to stay there ALSO READ: We don t accommodate blacks, it s God s law The Sunday Times reports police are investigating the man, Siyabonga Nsele&#8217;s death. It was further reported that according to Slade, the man had been running away with a bag of groceries, which had allegedly been stolen from his home, and what was later found to be a pair of pliers, when he shot him behind the ear. Slade reportedly told the Sunday Times that the killing could be justified by the Bible and he quoted the words: &#8220;If he comes into your house at night, you may kill him, no matter if he is white or black.&#8221; He also reportedly said the man had been there illegally and that it was &#8220;necessary to get rid of the problem&#8221;. He is also reported to have said, he did not &#8220;feel sorry for that&#8221;. The man&#8217;s parents had told the Sunday Times they were &#8220;disheartened&#8221; at the &#8220;lack of justice&#8221; in the case. While police reportedly investigate the case, Slade will be put before the Equality Court in the next two weeks to face a hate speech charge.
