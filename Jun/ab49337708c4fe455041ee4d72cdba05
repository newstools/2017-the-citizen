Poet Ntsiki Mazwai has shared a video slamming celebrities who did not take part in the Social Media Blackout protest by South Africans who were calling for the prices of data to fall on Wednesday. The Social Media Blackout protest called on South Africans to switch off social media accounts for a day and to refrain from buying data to force network providers to lower their data rates. It will apparently be done every Wednesday. Mazwai called the celebrities who failed to take part in the protest &#8220;dom&#8221;, saying they did not realise lower data rates would help their careers. If everyone could afford data, they would be able to download and stream their music, but it seemed as if celebrities did not understand that fact. &#8220;I just want to reiterate, le dom, you&#8217;re so ignorant. This is going to work for your careers; if there&#8217;s data for the masses then they can support you and download your song. They can watch your videos on YouTube, they can support your careers, they can see your work, but because you&#8217;ve got small hearts. Le dom, shem, guys,&#8221; she said. She further criticised them for not supporting a cause that, if successful, would benefit the masses, but always asked the masses to support and vote for them for awards. &#8220;When you want support, you expect everyone to jump up and download and to be voting for you and stuff. But when there is a cause that&#8217;s gonna affect everybody else, your egos are so up your asses that &#8230; it&#8217;s problematic,&#8221; she said.
