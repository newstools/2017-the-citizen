In the greater scheme of things, the Proteas&#8217; three-match T20 series against England is pretty meaningless. Both sides have selected fringe players in their respective squads and most of the attention is focused on the upcoming Test series. Yet South Africa&#8217;s tour has already been characterised by disappointment and sinking morale. Also read: Proteas T20 reinforcements don t exactly inspire hope And a good series in the shortest form in the game &#8211; which starts on Wednesday &#8211; could be beneficial. Here&#8217;s why these three battles are important. It can restore faith in AB de Villiers People aren&#8217;t quite sure what to make of the Proteas one-day skipper at the moment. There&#8217;s unease over his continued absence in Test cricket and his form in England to date hasn&#8217;t been great. How committed is De Villiers to the national cause still? He says he still wants to win the 2019 World Cup, which means he&#8217;ll still be an international cricketer for the next two years. Runs in this series dispel any doubts. Morne Morkel&#8217;s international resurgence can continue If there was anything the ICC Champions Trophy taught the Proteas, it was that they still need Morkel. The lanky and experienced 33-year-old seamer was South Africa&#8217;s best bowler in a poor campaign and his presence showed how short the side is of bowling firepower. Vernon Philander should be back in the Test line-up to bolster the attack but the T20 series can help Morkel stay in form. The Proteas are going to need his wickets. Tabraiz Shamsi is a weapon that needs to keep being developed The best sides in world cricket over the years are not only built on stability but also on players that provide an X-factor. Shamsi, a left-arm wrist spinner, currently won&#8217;t play in all conditions like Imran Tahir does. He&#8217;s probably still a bit too raw for that. But the tweaker is a bowler whose control has improved markedly over the past few seasons. Shamsi needs to be given more opportunities as he can eventually provide what Tahir does too: wickets and reliability. After all, Tahir won&#8217;t be around forever. Bowling depth is desperately needed The South Africa A tour &#8211; which is running concurrently with the Proteas&#8217; trip &#8211; has revealed a problem. A big one in fact: a lack of quality strike bowlers. If the Proteas had to call one up in the Champions Trophy, they would&#8217;ve had a hard time picking. But in Dane Paterson they&#8217;ve probably made the best choice in the absence of Kagiso Rabada. The Cobras seamer is a hard worker and recently took 7/27 in a three-day match against Hampshire.&#8217; It will be good thing if he&#8217;s keen to put up his hand.
