Referring to recently axed Nelson Mandela Bay deputy mayor Mongameli Bobani as &#8220;tjatjarag&#8221;, Malema accused the DA of undermining its coalition partners by taking decisions without consultation. He was speaking at a press conference about state corruption at EFF headquarters in Braamfontein on Thursday. READ MORE: Helen Zille s black dog post causes a storm on Twitter &#8220;There was a political process set up by a coalition which set up a three-man team and, before it breaks, it reaches conclusions. The DA is already dealing with the guy of the UDM,&#8221; he told the media. He was referring to the conflict situation that had arisen between Nelson Mandela Bay mayor Athol Trollip and Bobani. He said: &#8220;Our problem in this country is the DA; it is too forward and does not take advice. We said this to them too many times and they refused to listen. &#8220;The arrogance of the DA &#8230; you will see it in Helen Zille. We are not saying Trollip or UDM is right, we are saying respect internal processes,&#8221; he said. Malema then warned the DA that if they did not remove Helen Zille as premier, the party would remove the DA from power in the three metros it currently controls. &#8220;It is going to fail in the 2019 project of removing Zuma if they continue like this; they are also allowing Helen Zille to become the Zuma of the DA,&#8221; he continued. He said the EFF did not owe anything to anyone, and if the matter escalated to a point where fresh council elections would need to be called in metros where the DA was in power, &#8220;we will fold our hands and watch&#8221;. To Malema, the solution is clear: &#8220;Zille must resign and take the DA to court to clear her name,&#8221; but she would not, because she wanted to live up to the name of her recently released autobiography, Not Without a Fight. Zille&#8217;s tweets on colonialism, if Malema&#8217;s undertones were anything to go by, had caused huge consternation for the EFF. &#8220;Those of us that vote with the DA in municipalities &#8230; when Zille says colonialism is okay, she is undermining the process of removing the corrupt ANC. Where is she getting the mandate if she continues to be a premier? Who is she representing? Our people elected the DA, not Zille,&#8221; he said. He made it clear that, should Zille hold on to her position, even by the skin of her teeth, there would be repercussions. &#8220;They want Zuma removed but don t want to remove Zille. The DA is being playful again; they must be warned, and we do so now. You will remain with Western Capem but with Joburg, Tshwane and PE gone. &#8220;We are not going to vote with a party that loves individuals more than the state. We are close to withdrawing our support if Zille is not removed. &#8220;If Helen Zille is prepared to cost the DA all these municipalities, let her remain. The same thing we demand from the ANC, we must demand of each other. We must demand the same qualities from each other,&#8221; he said.
