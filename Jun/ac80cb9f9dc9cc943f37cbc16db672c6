Eleven people were injured Monday morning after a taxi overturned in St Wendolins Road in the Marianhill area, near Durban, Rescue Care Paramedics said in a statement. Rescue Care Paramedics spokesperson, Ceron Lennox, said that on arrival on the scene, paramedics found the taxi had left the roadway and come to rest on its side next to a house. A total of six children were among the injured, Lennox said. Once all of the injured had been stabilised, they were transported to various Durban Hospitals for further care. In another incident, on Shepstone Road and Blas Road in New Germany, paramedics found two cars and a taxi had crashed in a rear-end collision. Two people had sustained moderate injuries and were stabilised on the scene before being transported to nearby hospitals for the further care that they required, Lennox said. Meanwhile, on the M13 Durban-bound near Stapleton Road, paramedics were called to a scene where two vehicles had collided just before joining the N3 freeway. One person had sustained minor injuries and was treated and stabilised on the scene before being transported to a nearby hospital for further care, said Lennox. SAPS were in attendance at all of the collisions, and were investigating the cause of the accidents.
