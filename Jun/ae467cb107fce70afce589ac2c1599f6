EFF leader Julius Malema has opened up about a number of issues, including land and rumours around him going back to the ANC, in an interview with Tbo Touch on Wednesday. There were rumours last year that Malema had made a deal with the ANC should both parties agree on specific policies. However, Malema told Tbo Touch that his return to his former political home was only a myth. &#8220;There&#8217;s nothing to go back to,&#8221; he said, adding that his party was the future. Malema added that the ruling party was a mess even when he was expelled in 2012 for allegedly sowing division and bringing the party into disrepute. This was why he did not leave the ANC for another party but started his own. The EFF leader further addressed an issue on land that has apparently been scaring people, according to Tbo Touch, who said there were people who had approached him, asking that he ask Malema for clarity on the EFF&#8217;s stand. Malema said his party&#8217;s stance on land was not just a crazy campaign but one that sought to return land to the &#8220;rightful owners&#8221;. He spoke of how his party had wanted to occupty Steyn City but were stopped by the shack dwellers, who said the owner was taking care of them. We had a plan to occupy Stein City. When I heard there is a white man who owns a huge piece of land and he has named it after himself, we went to Diepsloot and the people said the looks after them, he creates employment and treats them well. I had to make a retreat because the masses said &#8216;not this man&#8217;,&#8221; he told Tbo Touch. The issue of land was so important to South Africans now that even the DA was talking about it. &#8220;Even Khanyi Mbau and Somizi [Mhlongo] are talking about land,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Those who love me will call me a revolutionary. I draw my inspiration from Nelson Mandela because he was called all sorts of things. The ANC told Mandela he was too risky but he did not listen. If he had listened, we would not be where we are now.&#8221; He further said that even the ANC Youth League in 2011 told him it was too dangerous to talk about land, but now that he has his own party, the ANC talks about it too. &#8220;Even President Jacob Zuma with his dirty mouth talks about land,&#8221; he said. #JuliusMalema: Black South Africans should not feel threatened by people threatening to leave country because of economic transformation &mdash; Simnikiwe H (@onlynikki89) June 7, 2017 #JuliusMalema says he is happy #Zuma is finally speaking about land, even though he may not mean it @TheCitizen_News &mdash; Simnikiwe H (@onlynikki89) June 7, 2017
