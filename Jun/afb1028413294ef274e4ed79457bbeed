Mandla &#8216;Mampintsha&#8217; Maphumulo and Bongekile &#8216;Babes Wodumo&#8217; Simelane have left many on social media wondering if they had their traditional wedding on Saturday. Babes Wodumo shared a picture of herself with boyfriend Mampintsha in a Zulu traditional outfit and included an icon of a present and a bell. Babes Wodumo is also sporting a ring on her wedding finger. Mampintsha commented on the picture and said he was &#8221;singing wololo&#8221;. On his own Instagram page, Mampintsha shared the same picture and wrote in isiZulu: &#8220;I will be grateful when I receive it,&#8221; and also included an icon of a gift. Babes Wodumo commented on the picture with an icon of a crown. Some have speculated that the two had their traditional wedding today, saying Mampintsha owed Babes Wodumo that much after &#8220;failing&#8221; to get her to the BET Awards in the US. Nkosinathi &#8220;Black Coffee&#8221; Maphumulo further fuelled the wedding rumours after commenting on the picture with several high fives. Some are, however, not buying it as they said the two were shooting a music video and posted the pictures as a publicity stunt. Though the two have not publicly confirmed their relationship, they have left Mzansi with no option but to conclude they are a couple after always being seen together and sharing photos of each other on their social media accounts.
