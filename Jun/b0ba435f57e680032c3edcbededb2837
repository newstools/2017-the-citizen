Muzi Yeni is retaining his top spot as the leading jockey at Flamingo Park and could be the one to follow today when he teams up with Lady Duchess. They have raced together five times for a win and three places. The pair could make it victory number two when lining up in the main-event, a FM 80 Handicap over 1400m. This Corrie Lensley-trained runner should be in fine fettle following her second place finish behind Well Dressed, who is undefeated over the course and distance. Lady Duchess hasn t won since late February However, there s an old expression that You re only as good as your last performance. In that case, the good news for punters is that her last performance was very promising. She holds a number of runners on form, including Cash In Camilla, Dukes Idol and Pep Squad. Yeni s mount is well drawn in stall No 9 and will shoulder a modest 56kg which should increase her chances. This four-year-old filly s biggest danger could be Pep Squad whose form clearly indicates she s most effective over the 1400m trip. Following Muzi could result in a profit. He looks hard to beat in the first aboard Wings N Things and he s riding my best bet Pampierstad in Race 3. This Lensley-trained three-year-old ran well at the Vaal and looks ready to register his maiden win today.
