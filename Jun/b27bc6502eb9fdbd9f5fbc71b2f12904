The SABC has officially dismissed its suspended chief operating officer, Hlaudi Motsoeneng, after an internal disciplinary hearing found him guilty of misconduct, the SABC announced on Monday afternoon. The ruling by the chairperson of the disciplinary hearing, Advocate Nazeer Cassim, was announced by interim board chair Khanyisile Kweyama during a press briefing in Auckland Park, Johannesburg. She said the board had accepted the findings of misconduct against Motsoeneng. The chairperson of that disciplinary hearing has given us feedback this morning [Monday], and has recommended that Mr Motsoeneng be dismissed from the SABC. The SABC interim board has accepted those recommendations, and we have communicated with Mr Motsoeneng [about] his dismissal from the SABC, Kweyama said. It was discovered that Motsoeneng does not have a matric qualification. Hlaudi is also known as &#8220;Mr 90%&#8221; because he fought for the SABC to play and broadcast local content, so it wouldn&#8217;t be a surprise if he joined Isidingo. On the other hand, another Twitter user thinks Hlaudi will join ANN7 as an executive. They found him to not have THAT thing in his position #HlaudiMotsoeneng pic.twitter.com/YZb0cDzNtR &mdash; NomaRashiya_ (@RashiyaNoma) June 12, 2017 When you&#39;re unemployed and even MacDs and Chicken Licken require someone with Matric #HlaudiMotsoeneng #SABC pic.twitter.com/KF0UDBh0U7 &mdash; AbortedNews (@AbortedNews) June 12, 2017 #HlaudiMotsoeneng has been found guilty pic.twitter.com/4PvVHqvYfx &mdash; Makaveli (@MAKAVELI314) June 12, 2017 #HlaudiMotsoeneng about to dive into Gupta TV exec team &#8230;. pic.twitter.com/b7AOpPEkRB &mdash; Khan Sifile (@KhanSifile) June 12, 2017 #HlaudiMotsoeneng will surprise you all and join Isidingo. pic.twitter.com/AFIheTGgpx &mdash; Mfikie_Mdiyana (@mfikie) June 12, 2017 Fair to say #HlaudiMotsoeneng lost that thing&#8230; pic.twitter.com/1XRgrU716J &mdash; SMASH (@Truu_Black) June 12, 2017 ALSO READ: Hlaudi Motsoeneng fired from SABC after disciplinary hearing
