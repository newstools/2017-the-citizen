A 59-year-old man sustained fatal injuries when he apparently fell five storeys down a shaft at a building in Bloemfontein, ER24 said on Thursday. The private emergency services provider said the incident occurred at a building in St Andrews Street on Wednesday afternoon. ER24 spokesperson, Werner Vermaak, said: Shortly after 3pm, paramedics from ER24 arrived on the scene where they found the man and his co-worker at the bottom of the shaft. It is understood that they were working on a pipe on the fifth floor when the man fell forward into the shaft. His co-worker ran down and found him at the bottom. Sadly, by the time paramedics arrived on the scene, there was nothing that they could do for him and he was declared dead on scene. Police attended the scene and were investigating.
