In the world of over-coupling, Wildekrans M thode Cap Classique Chenin Blanc is the round head in a square hole unabashedly standing up for singles among its peers. When it comes to M thode Cap Classique, blends of Chardonnay, Chenin Blanc and Cabernet Franc reign supreme. All delicious,but their uniqueness is questionable. It s no wonder then that Wildekrans M thode Cap Classique Chenin Blanc s allure is it s celebration of the Chenin Blanc grape. Winning silver at this year s Old Mutual Trophy Wine Show, Wildekrans glorious MCC is proving that it not only stands up to other MCCs, it outshines them. A lot, most likely, has to do with the care taken to create every bottle of sparkling gold. The Chenin Blanc grapes are whole-bunch pressed, and the wine is fermented in tanks before their partial stay in French Oak Barrels before finding residence in bottles. Bottles are carefully riddled by hand and aged for 24 months on the lees. What is created is a fresh, sweetly lemoniness that really hits you when you re used to traditional MCCs. But its dry, fruity finish and smacks of berries remind you why you love a good MCC. The best part is that with winter fully upon us, now is the time to embrace the evening chill as you open a bottle of your favourite MCC. MCC ideally should be served at temperatures between 6 and 10 degrees meaning that after a short chill in the fridge, a cold night out is exactly what your hard-earned bottle needs. Also, don t be scared that those lively bubbles will escape. In a good bottle of MCC fizz can last well over a day (but who on earth can open a bottle of MCC and not finish it? even if you re single). &nbsp;
