An armed hijacker was shot and killed and his accomplice was injured in a foiled hijack attempt on the N4 highway near Alzu Petroport in KwaZulu-Natal. Within minutes of the incident, several police and CPF members from Eastdene arrived on the scene and combed the area, but the remaining suspects were nowhere to be found. One of the suspects, who is yet to be identified, was confirmed dead on the scene. Initial reports suggest he could be from Pretoria, Newcastle Advertiser reported. An ID book found on the scene puts the age of the suspect at 41. More to come. &#8211; Caxton News Service For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
