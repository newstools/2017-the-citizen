Trainer Justin Snaith s decision to run Bela-Bela in the R1-million Jons son Workwear Garden Province Stakes (Grade 1) over 1600m as opposed to the Vodacom Durban July should pay dividends if statistics are any thing to go by. The daughter of Dynasty and three-year-old Safe Harbour are the jointly the best handicapped runners in this weight-for-age race for fillies and mares. How ever, Bela-Bela did beat Safe Har bour by 0.40 lengths in the Grade 1 Paddock Stakes over 1600m at Kenilworth in January but is now 4.5kg better off. That difference is based on the weight-for-age adjustment but that does mean Safe Harbour would have to have made that lev el of improvement in order to re verse the results. Bela-Bela has an ideal No 5 draw, which could come in to No 3 if the reserve runners come out, and has a top jockey in Anthony Delpech. She has won six of her 12 starts, two of which have been Grade 1 events. Anton Marcus will be aboard Just Sensual and she will jump from barrier No 7 (which could improve to No 5). On merit ratings the pair have a 3kg advantage over Bella Sonata and Star Express with Fort Ember and Polyphonic next best. The two Grade 2 events for juve niles Durban Golden Horseshoe and the Gold Circle Golden Slip per over 1400m look extremely competitive and good draws could well decide the outcome.
