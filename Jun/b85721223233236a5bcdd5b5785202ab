After cutting ties with record label Vth Season to work with his company, Beam, Kiernan &#8216;AKA&#8217; Forbes has landed himself a radio slot. AKA will reportedly have his own show called the Supa Mega Show. Its first broadcast will be on June 19, Sunday Sun has reported. Touch HD manager Martin Vilakazi told the publication that the venture was not just a show but &#8220;an innovative programme that will blow people away&#8221;. Vilakazi further said the station had formed a &#8220;strategic alliance&#8221; with the Supa Mega that would definitely &#8220;work&#8221;. He said the online shows would, however, be evaluated every three months to establish how well the new concept was working. Though news that AKA was leaving Vth Season surfaced last year, it was only confirmed in a statement last week that he was officially leaving for his own company. It is with this growth and support structure that AKA and Raphael Benza of Vth Season have now mutually parted ways in all forms of their business relationship, as of June 1, 2017.&#8221; AKA seems to have left the station on good terms as he paid tribute to the partnership. I have the utmost respect for the Vth Season team. Together, we created magic. I have learnt a lot from the music industry, and it s time for me to start building my own legacy and become South Africa s first Music Mogul. The process of establishing BEAM from scratch has not been easy, but has been liberating, as I have a great business team to lean on. Thus BEAM s focus is not just music, as my ultimate aim is to be a multi-investor, with success in different industries, he said.
