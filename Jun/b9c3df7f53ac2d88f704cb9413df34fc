In the wake of the media storm that followed EFF allegations that former home affairs minister Malusi Gigaba irregularly awarded Gupta family members &#8216;early naturalisation&#8217; certificates, former ANC MP and serial social-media-explosive-files-dropper Vytjie Mentor has taken to her preferred hunting ground, Facebook, to question Gigaba&#8217;s birth and origin. The volley of Facebook posts were published over a 24-hour period. Gigaba&#8217;s ministerial spokesperson, Mayihlome Tshwete, told The Citizen that Mentor should not continue being quoted as a credible source, as she had previously said the minister signed the nuclear deal before he was even appointed as finance minister, and this turned out to be factually incorrect. &#8220;This is a clear example of absurdity and the ludicrous nature of allegations levelled at the minister in a clumsy and orchestrated campaign that does not care about facts and is aimed at discrediting the minister,&#8221; Tshwete said. Tshwete also told The Citizen it was &#8220;irresponsible of a former member of parliament to make comments that fuel xenophobia and expose her ignorance&#8221;. &#8220;Next week she will say the minister is an extraterrestrial being.&#8221; According to Mentor, the finance minister&#8217;s original surname is Gigamba, not Gigaba as known. In another post, she refers to Gigaba as &#8220;our Zimbabwean minister&#8221;. She also informed her social media followers the former ANC Youth League leader &#8220;is not a South African&#8221;. Mentor challenged her followers to provide proof of Gigaba being capable of speaking isiZulu for more than an hour. She alleged his &#8220;umbilical cord was not buried on the South African soil&#8221;.
