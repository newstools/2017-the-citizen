As expected, Springbok coach Allister Coetzee will rely heavily on Super Rugby combinations to stem the French tide at Loftus on Saturday. Three backs from the Lions will be handed their Test debuts. Andries Coetzee and Courtnall Skosan have been the most consistent backline performers in the tournament this year and their understanding will obviously be crucial at the weekend. In one of the more unlikely stories of the year, reliable Lions scrumhalf Ross Cronje will also earn a first cap and reunite with his provincial halfback partner Elton Jantjies. Cronje is known as one of the calmest No 9s on the domestic circuit and his defence is also solid. &#8220;We have gone for settled combinations and selected players for the starting fifteen who have trained well with us,&#8221; said Allister Coetzee. &#8220;They are in good form so far this season and they will be battle-ready. It is a great opportunity for our uncapped players to cement their places in the team.&#8221; A question mark hangs over the physicality of the loose trio as skipper Warren Whiteley, Siya Kolisi and Oupa Mohoje are more known for their running skills than dominating the collisions. At least young Sharks blindside flanker Jean-Luc du Preez provides grunt on the bench. &#8220;I am excited about our loose trio combination,&#8221; said Coetzee. The Bok mentor duly included the experience of Francois Hougaard and Frans Steyn on the bench. Springboks: Andries Coetzee, Raymond Rhule, Jesse Kriel, Jan Serfontein, Courtnall Skosan, Elton Jantjies, Ross Cronje, Warren Whiteley (c), Oupa Mohoje, Siya Kolisi, Franco Mostert, Eben Etzebeth, Frans Malherbe, Malcolm Marx, Beast Mtawarira. Bench: Bongi Mbonambi, Steven Kitshoff, Coenie Oosthuizen, Pieter-Steph du Toit, Jean-Luc du Preez, Francois Hougaard, Frans Steyn, Dillyn Leyds.
