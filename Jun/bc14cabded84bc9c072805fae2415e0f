Marikana activist Napoleon Webster and 13 other men charged with murder briefly appeared in the Rustenburg Magistrates Court on Friday. The case against them was postponed to June 19, because there was no water and electricity supply at the court building. Aubrey Seitsang, Sibonile Sobopha, Mdlondozi Fundiwo, Herbert Baqhesi, Napoleon Webster and William Nyenyane had already been denied bail. Aphindile Pungone, Samson Gqwetani, Gift Luveli, Nkululeko Msithwa, Nkosindiphile Nziyose, Luvo Soyizwaphi, Sivuyile Qasha and Mzolisi Mbulana were expected to apply for bail on June 19. The State alleged they hacked Sabata Petros Chale, 39, to death in Marikana West, on December 8, 2016, allegedly over the allocation of low-cost (RDP) houses at Marikana West Extension 2. Chale was allegedly chased by a group of about 30 people and was hacked to death with pangas, axes and spears. He died at the scene. His attackers allegedly drank his blood. The group held their clinched firsts up when they were led to the court cells after their case was postponed. Some waved and smiled to family members in the packed courtroom. The court was packed to capacity mostly with women from Marikana and members of the Economic Freedom Fighters. The group believed the charge against the accused were politically motivated, saying it was the African National Congress fighting against the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) for control of Marikana. The EFF is the dominant party in Marikana.
