While the Proteas ran into Pakistan at their unpredictable best, coach Russell Domingo insisted they hadn&#8217;t underestimated their inconsistent opponents. South Africa suffered an unexpected setback in the Champions Trophy on Wednesday night when they lost by 19 runs on the Duckworth-Lewis method to Mickey Arthur&#8217;s troops in Birmingham. Also read: Proteas reminded that rankings mean nothing &#8220;There was no complacency on our side,&#8221; said Domingo. &#8220;We played a game of cricket and Pakistan played better than us. That&#8217;s got nothing to do with complacency as far as I&#8217;m concerned.&#8221; The problem with the Proteas in ICC tournaments is that they are always under pressure from both sides of the spectrum. If they don&#8217;t lose due to complacency, people wonder whether the attention of being considered one of the favourites gets to them. But Domingo tried to downplay that too. &#8220;No, there&#8217;s nothing playing on our minds. Not at all. We know that there&#8217;s a lot of talk about us having not won a competition for a long time,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There&#8217;s nothing we can do about it. It&#8217;s outside of what we can control. We&#8217;ve just got to focus on playing good cricket and preparing well. We haven&#8217;t played good cricket in this match. We have to take that on the chin and acknowledge that our performance is not as good as what we can put together.&#8221; Another concern is captain AB de Villiers&#8217; state of mind and how his body is holding up. The dynamic middle-order batter scored his first first-ball duck in 212 ODI innings when he rashly slapped Pakistan left-arm tweaker Imad Wasim to point. Domingo also confirmed that he has picked up a hamstring niggle. &#8220;I&#8217;m not concerned about him,&#8221; he said. &#8220;He&#8217;s a quality player. Everybody gets a first-baller. It&#8217;s just taken him 200 games, I suppose, there&#8217;s always going to be question marks. &#8220;Obviously he did pick up a little bit of a niggle with his hamstring today, but the medical team will look at him. But I&#8217;m by no means concerned. I&#8217;m expecting him to put in a big performance on Sunday against India . He&#8217;s that type of player. I&#8217;m sure of that.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
