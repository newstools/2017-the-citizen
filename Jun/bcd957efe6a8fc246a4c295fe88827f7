A group of 29 former employees of the company Servest, in the Epping Industrial area in Cape Town, appeared in court on Monday, all charged with public violence. They appeared in the Parow Regional Court, before magistrate Constance Nziweni, who remanded them to July 21, when their trial is expected to commence. Their case is a sequel to unrest at Servest s premises nearly two years ago, when the group are alleged to have ignored a Western Cape Labour Court interdict, restraining them from causing any further damage to the premises. According to the charge sheet, the company obtained the interdict during a wage dispute. In the course of the unrest, the group was locked out , and prosecutor Daniel Cloete alleges that they first torched and then broke down the main gate to the premises. According to the charge sheet, the police were called, only to have stones hurled at them, compelling the police to use tear gas to disperse them. It is alleged that the group defied the Labour Court Interdict, and returned to the premises to protest. African News Agency (ANA)
