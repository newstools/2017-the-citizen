Sardine frenzy has continued this week, much to the delight of all, with the silver fish being netted at Winklespruit, Amanzimtoti and Isipingo beaches this morning in KwaZulu-Natal, South Coast Herald reports. Mike Anderson-Reade, head of operations at the KwaZulu-Natal Sharks Board, said that a total of eight nets had been landed, with net sizes varying from small to medium. The netters are selling the fish for R900 a crate, with each crate holding between 28 to 30 dozen sardines, depending on the size of the fish. Netting could possibly continue in these areas this afternoon, said Anderson-Reade. He added that observations from the flight this morning revealed scattered pockets of sardine between Isipingo and Umgababa. These pockets are accompanied by a small number of Cape gannets.

There is a strong southwesterly wind forecast for this evening, hopefully the rougher conditions will not move the fish offshore again, he said. Shark safety gear has been removed between and including Scottburgh and Anstey s Beach on the Bluff. All the other shark safety gear along the coast remains in place and beaches are open for bathing. This may change as the run develops and more gear may be removed over the coming days depending on the status of the sardine shoals.
