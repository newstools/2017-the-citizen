Robert Marawa remains off the air as his beef with Metro FM continues. His producer, Beverly Maphangwa, was suspended for playing audio from the broadcaster s prime competitor, SuperSport, of Sizwe Mabena during Marawa s Metro FM radio show. Marawa tweeted he would not be on his show because of Maphangwa s suspension. SABC spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago said in a statement that they were dealing with Marawa directly on the matter and would only comment once it was resolved. Marawa told The Sowetan he was unsure of what was happening, but he remained committed to supporting Maphangwa and would only take to the air again once the &#8220;grossly unfair&#8221; suspension was overturned. Marawa continues to face being fired after boycotting work without leave last week. He reportedly refused to work with another producer.
