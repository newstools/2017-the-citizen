Michael Oatley, the former chairperson of CIEX, has told the media former South African Reserve Bank governor Tito Mboweni is being economical with the truth. In Mboweni&#8217;s long-winded style, he wrote on Facebook that in &#8220;1998, a British bounty hunter [former British spy Michael Oatley]&#8221; informed the ANC &#8220;that there was a debt that the &#8216;Boers&#8217; had to repay the new South Africa&#8221;. Mboweni continued: &#8220;He [Oatley] produced to us documents that showed that Absa was liable to pay back about R1.5 billion with interest over the years. He, in return, would receive 10% as a fee for helping us retrieve these &#8216;stolen&#8217; monies, and Oatley&#8217;s offer for assistance was rejected.&#8221; The former governor said upon assuming the reins at the central bank, he instituted &#8220;an independent investigation headed by a judge&#8221;, which recommended that the matter be closed.

Oatley reportedly said that, in fact, the team never arrived at the conclusion that the transactions among Bankorp, Absa and Reserve Bank were &#8220;illegal&#8221;. Oatley further contended that Mboweni&#8217;s version of events was inaccurate, pointing out that at some point he wrote a letter to Mboweni regarding the findings of the special team that the bailout was irregular. &#8220;In his reply to me dated 15 April 2002, Mboweni did not dispute that the opportunity for recovery existed, as indeed it still does, along with other opportunities for restitution,&#8221; Oatley reportedly said. &#8220;The process has moved on to such an extent that we want this matter closed.&#8221; However, in his Facebook post, Mboweni emphasised it was the opinion of one panel, and their door had always been open for a different authority whose investigations gave a different outcome. &#8220;Yes, I must admit that a different panel might have come to a different conclusion, as these matters normally are the case.&#8221; Mboweni offers the &#8216;facts&#8217; on British &#8216;bounty hunter&#8217; in CIEX case &nbsp;
