Travis Scott and Bryson Tiller managed to pack the Dome in Johannesburg and the Polokwane cricket club over two days. Their Castle Lite Unlocks concert hit it off on Thursday with thousands of people in attendance. The shows were already sold out within a month of the announcement the pair would be performing. Travis and Bryson got more than a warm welcome from the Jozi crowd who sang along to every track and jumped in enthusiasm as Travis delivered from his hit album and performed singles like Entidope and Goosebumps. But, in Polokwane the concert was nothing like Jozi according to reviews on Twitter. Instead, the weather was a bummer for many concert goers who believed that city would be warmer than Joburg. It was insanely cold last night in Polokwane moer!!! &mdash; Shane King (@IamTAYDOS) June 17, 2017 Perhaps the cold got to the crowd who it appears weren&#8217;t as lit as Joburg and gave trap soul singer Bryson Tiller, the cold shoulder. The people of Polokwane didn&#39;t take to Bryson Tiller??? What were the promoters expecting? &mdash; Karabo Jarvis (@KaraboJavas) June 17, 2017 No one in Polokwane actually knew Bryson Tiller . The crowd was DEAAAD #CastleLiteUnlocksPolokwane pic.twitter.com/XfKtxV5zjx &mdash; Qu (@quency_mbonani) June 17, 2017 &nbsp; Wow Polokwane&#39;s energy for Bryson and Travis was soooooooooo weak What a waste &mdash; Mr Worst Behavior (@AbSoLut_OG) June 17, 2017 Judge for yourself which concert was more lit from the videos below Johannesburg: &nbsp; WE CAME IN NUMBERS TO SEE THE GREATEST OF ALL TIME !!! @trvisXX #butterflyeffect #CastleLiteUnlocks pic.twitter.com/qGg4A9AHEj #2DECADESOUTNOW (@KingTheDuke) June 16, 2017 last night be crazy in Johannesburg with Travis Scott performing in South Africa #travisscottsouthafrica pic.twitter.com/k1nb8OV1nT Azhar Azeez (@imazhar_) June 16, 2017 Travis Scott performing The Ends in South Africa @trvisXX pic.twitter.com/nxkSHa52fK TRAVIS SCOTT FANPAGE (@YamzInTheTrap) June 15, 2017 Polokwane: &nbsp; 90210 IN POLOKWANE #CastleLiteUnlocks @trvisXX pic.twitter.com/UXrVrqatZM #CastleLiteUnlocks Thabo Moagi (@DjParsonsSA) June 17, 2017 @trvisXX PERFORMING MAMACITA IN POLOKWANE #CastleLiteUnlocks @trvisXX pic.twitter.com/Ls3iOKPwDA Thabo Moagi (@DjParsonsSA) June 17, 2017 Abuti fill up @CassperNyovest unlocking greatness on the extra cold stage #CastleLiteUnlocks pic.twitter.com/3GNTZRjKE9 Thabo Moagi (@DjParsonsSA) June 17, 2017
