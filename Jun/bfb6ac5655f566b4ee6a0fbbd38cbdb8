DJ Euphonik was on Sunday night referred to verse 7 of his own commandments after a comment that left most on Twitter wondering why he even bothered. Vusimuzi Xaba shared a picture of a woman in bed, presumably his lover, with breakfast on the one side of the bread and wrote: &#8220;Fellas this is how you wake her up on a Sunday morning. Blessed day y&#8217;all!&#8221; Fellas this is how you wake her up on a Sunday morning. Blessed day y&#39;all! pic.twitter.com/YSG6dCJjgd &mdash; Vusimuzi Xaba (@mavava101) June 11, 2017 The picture received a lot of comments with some women sharing how they prefer to be woken up. DJ Euphonik shared his own thoughts on the picture and just ruined the moment for everyone. &#8220;Just buy a bigger house so she doesn&#8217;t have to sleep against the wall or fall on ur ornaments if she rolls over, otherwise well done chap,&#8221; he said.

Euphonik did not stop there; he went on to talk about the &#8220;reality&#8221; of how romantic guys constantly lost to blessers, saying it was worse for those who even &#8220;advertised&#8221; their &#8220;situation&#8221;. However, one user, who was not impressed with Euphonik, told him the picture had nothing to do with a bigger house. They said it was about a man spoiling his woman, bringing his ex-girlfriend Bonang Matheba into it. &#8220;You bought a big house and Bonang still left you, but that&#8217;s none of my business,&#8221; the user said. These were some of the reactions: &#8220;This comment was not necessary, Why look down on other people before commending them? Effort prevails in this case man.&#8221; &#8220;If you&#8217;re unhappy with yourself try fixing what&#8217;s broken instead of breaking others.&#8221; &#8220;You couldn&#8217;t just compliment without the shade? Pretty sure if someone said this to you you&#8217;d be suing.&#8221; &#8220;Thats petty &amp; childish to say the least.&#8221; &#8220;Bonang o areng! don&#8217;t you think you&#8217;re the last person to give people advices about women? Iyooh.&#8221; &#8220;The bigger house does not define Vusimuzi but what he has done for his lady it defines the way he is as a person that he&#8217;s full of love.&#8221; &#8220;How do u know that his not saving money to buy one ? That was so unnecessary and it&#8217;s not funny at all. Stop looking down on others bhuti.&#8221;
