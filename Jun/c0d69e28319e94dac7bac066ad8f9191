Proof that boxing looks after its own will be evident this weekend when Golden Gloves hosts an auction to help raise money for the family of slain boxer Herbert Nkabiti. Nkabiti died in April from injuries sustained in the ring, leaving behind a wife and a six-month-old child. &#8220;His family will be ringside and we will honour Herbert s memory,&#8221; said promoter Rodney Berman, who hosts a major tournament at Emperors Palace on Saturday. There is no reserve price on the auction item a framed and signed action photo of Muhammad Ali against Sonny Liston but Golden Gloves has underwritten a R20 000 guarantee. What s more, a LA Lakers jersey signed by basketball great Kobe Bryant will also be up for auction with proceeds going to the Botswanan s family. &#8220;I feel desperately sorry for his family and this will hopefully help alleviate some of their difficulties,&#8221; said Berman. &#8220;Boxing s fans are big-hearted, so I m hopeful we ll raise good cash.&#8221; Meanwhile, Thabiso Mchunu and Johnny Muller have a lot to fight for when they meet in an African Boxing Union and SA cruiserweight fight on Saturday. A return to title contention is the big prize that awaits the winner of the clash. The pair headline the all-action tournament that has been called &#8220;Hurtin for Certain&#8221;. Mchunu is rebuilding his career after defeat in a championship shot against former Olympic champion Oleksandr Usyk and Muller is looking to work his way into the top 15 after winning, and then losing, against top 10-ranked Kevin Lerena.
