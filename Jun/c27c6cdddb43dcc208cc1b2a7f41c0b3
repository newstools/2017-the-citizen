Five people were injured, three of them critically, when a light delivery vehicle and car collided head-on on the N1 near the Huguenot Tunnel between Worcester and Cape Town late on Friday night, paramedics said. ER24 paramedics, along with Metro Services, arrived on the scene and found the delivery vehicle on its side while the car was found on the side of the road, ER24 spokesman Russel Meiring said. Upon closer inspection, paramedics found two men trapped inside the delivery vehicle while a third man was found on the ground a short distance away. Two other people were found seated in the car. Metro Services had to use specialised equipment to free both men from the vehicle, an operation lasting 30 minutes. Once freed, paramedics found that the three men had sustained critical injuries while the two from the light motor vehicle had sustained moderate injuries. Paramedics treated the patients and provided the critically injured patients with advanced life support interventions. The critically injured patients were transported to Worcester Provincial Hospital while the two others were transported to Mediclinic Worcester for further treatment. The cause of the collision was not yet known, Meiring said. African News Agency (ANA)
