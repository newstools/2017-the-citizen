Parliamentary staff were in a celebratory mood on Friday after news the legislature s officers had agreed to place the Secretary of the institution on special leave pending the outcome of an investigation against him. Parliament announced earlier in the day that Gengezi Mgidlana had been placed on special leave after allegations were levelled against him by the National Health, Education and Allied Workers Union (Nehawu), who represents most of the legislature s workers. Chairman of Nehawu s parliament branch, Sthembiso Tembe, addressed workers shortly after the news broke, saying while they would have preferred Mgidlana was suspended, they welcomed the fact that they were one step closer to their final goal. It s a small step towards the ultimate prize that Mgidlana is kicked out of Parliament because he was never fit to run Parliament, said Tembe to loud cheers from staff. We want to say to Mgidlana, we don t want you . Thank you very much for the torture and the oppression. Tembe warned this was only the beginning , issuing a warning to other problematic managers in Parliament that their time is also coming . Nehawu said it would present all documentation related to their allegations of maladministration against Mgidlana to the external audit committee that was set up by Parliament s presiding officers to conduct the probe. The union was also set to send these documents to Public Protector (PP) Busisiwe Mkhwebana. In July last year, Nehawu laid a complaint at the PP s office. The union said it would now be adding more complaints. She [Mkhwebana] has to prove herself because she hasn t proven herself to us, or anyone in South Africa, said Tembe.
