JP Duminy decided not to bank his Indian Premier League (IPL) pay cheque because he wanted to focus on the Proteas. The left-hander spent six weeks at home working on various aspects of his game. Also read: The Proteas depressing history in the Champions Trophy &#8220;I certainly put in a lot of hard work,&#8221; the 33-year-old said on Thursday head of South Africa&#8217;s first match in the ICC Champions Trophy against Sri Lanka on Saturday. &#8220;The main thing for me was to try to be mentally fresh for this tournament and what actually lies ahead on the tour of England. I feel I&#8217;ve achieved that with my break. In terms of my skills, there were definitely one or two things I needed to work on. I&#8217;m hoping it pays off.&#8221; Indeed, Duminy&#8217;s decision to put national interest first is something to be lauded. But it&#8217;s not going to relieve any of the pressure on him. The experienced international is still criticised for not playing to his full potential and a promising home season tailed off with a poor tour of New Zealand. If Duminy took a break for six weeks, you can bet the South African cricket public is insisting on results. That&#8217;s the name of the game in this country. Despite showing good form in the Proteas&#8217; warm-up matches on their tour, he&#8217;s yet to translate that into a big score on the biggest stage. And that means the mental &#8220;freshness&#8221; Duminy tried to achieve with his break will now have to come in handy. &#8220;When you play for South Africa, every game is important,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The team and I don&#8217;t want to put extra pressure on ourselves thinking we need to win this tournament. We definitely want to but we&#8217;ll take it game by game. Personally, I don&#8217;t feel there&#8217;s added pressure. My expectations for myself are always high. &#8220;That never changes, so that&#8217;s my mindset.&#8221; Duminy embraces the responsibilities that comes with being a senior player but he also believes it&#8217;s time for younger if established players like Quinton de Kock, Kagiso Rabada and David Miller to pull their weight too. &#8220;I think our responsibility to contribute should be equally spread. We&#8217;ve learned on this tour already that we all need to stay in the moment and keep calm in the pressure moments,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Whether you&#8217;re young or experienced, that doesn&#8217;t change. It applies to everyone.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
