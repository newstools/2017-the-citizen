This week&#8217;s The New Age (TNA) Business Breakfast show will be the last of its kind as the SABC&#8217;s interim board has reportedly shut it down. The board has met with The New Age and informed them of the decision despite the current contract which says they must be given 11 months&#8217; notice, source told City Press. The source further revealed that the broadcasts, which used to be held five times a year before Hlaudi Motsoeneng took over he reins, cost the SABC around R20 million as Motsoeneng came in and increased the number to as many as 45 annually. The SABC had apparently not made a cent in return. Sources who spoke to City Press said the board has been most of its time clarifying where the SABC needs the help of the Special Investigating Unit to uncover illegal activities at the public broadcaster. They have reportedly sent a letter to Communications Minister Ayanda Dlodlo to make a request to President Jacob Zuma for a declaration announcing an investigation into the SABC. One of the issues that needed investigation was reportedly Motsoeneng&#8217;s suspension on a R350 000 monthly salary. When the board suspended COO James Aguma two week backs, they gave him a letter, locked his office, blocked his access and took his SABC devices but it seems the same was not done to Motsoeneng, who apparently still had access to the SABC computer system while he was suspended. Motsoneneng &#8216;s 90% content quota on radio was another issue the board had reportedly dealt with. The board had to prevent SABC&#8217;s big commercial stations from bleeding advertising revenue. It has reportedly decided to &#8220;allow stations to choose how much local content they want to play, as long as it&#8217;s not less than what Icasa stipulates,&#8221; a source was quoted as saying.
