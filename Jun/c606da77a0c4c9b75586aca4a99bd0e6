Rescue Care paramedics were called to the scene soon after 7pm, Rescue Care spokesman Garrith Jamieson said on Saturday. On their arrival they found that a bakkie had crashed into the back of a truck which was believed to have been stationary after breaking down. On assessment paramedics found that the driver of the [bakkie] had suffered extensive injuries and unfortunately there was nothing more paramedics could do for him; he was declared deceased on the scene. The passenger sustained moderate injuries and was stabilised on the scene before being transported to a nearby hospital for further care. The truck driver was not injured, Jamieson said.
