A truck driver was airlifted to hospital after two trucks collided on Allandale road between Midrand and Kempton on Wednesday, paramedics said. Netcare 911 spokesperson Nick Dollman said the driver of one of the trucks had sustained severe injuries and was trapped inside the truck. The 61-year-old male was attended to by Advanced Life Support paramedics from Netcare 911 and other services and was placed on a ventilator. His injuries were of such a serious nature that an emergency helicopter was dispatched to the scene. He said specialised hydraulic equipment were used to free the man from the wreckage of the truck. He was extricated, stabilised on the scene and then airlifted to a specialised trauma hospital for the urgent medical care that he required.
