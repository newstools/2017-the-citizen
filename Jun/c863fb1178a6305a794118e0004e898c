Nothing less than victory tonight in the Nedbank Cup final at the Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban will do for Orlando Pirates. The Buccaneers have endured a horrible season, finishing the league outside the top eight for the first time in the PSL era. They eventually had to settle for 11th spot in the Premiership standings after only managing six victories from 30 matches and twice conceded six goals in league defeats. One of those defeats came against SuperSport United, their opponents for tonight. Pirates coach Kjell Jonevret and company will know only too well that a triumph tonight will ease the pain their loyal supporters have suffered this season. A win will also give them hope ahead of next season. In the other corner, SuperSport United would love nothing more than to give coach Stuart Baxter the perfect send-off in his last game in charge, after the Briton accepted the reins of Bafana Bafana for a second time in his career. SuperSport have had a solid season, losing finalists in the Telkom Knockout, and staying in contention for league honours up until the final weeks of the competition, before eventually settling for fifth place after an indifferent finish. It s a late finish to the local soccer season. Let s hope the wait was well worth it and the final lives up to its billing.
