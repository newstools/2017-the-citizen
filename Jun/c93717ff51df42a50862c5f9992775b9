The Eskom board on Thursday announced the appointment of Johnny Dladla as acting group chief executive officer with immediate effect. The announcement follows &#8220;intense consultations&#8221; between Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown and the Eskom board to arrive at a &#8220;prudent choice&#8221;. &#8220;Both parties are of the firm belief that Dladla s experience and expertise will stabilise Eskom in the short term,&#8221; said Eskom in a statement. Dladla has sufficient skills to excel in this role. He has 22 years of experience within the Eskom, 17 years invested in various nonregulated businesses and five years as chief executive officer for Eskom enterprises and its subsidiaries, said acting board chairperson Zethembe Khoza. Echoing Khoza s sentiments, Brown said: I welcome the appointment of Mr Dladla, as it will bring further stability to Eskom and its executive team. Dladla has worked for international brands such as BHP Billiton and South African Breweries (SAB). A chartered marketer, he has studied across a range of critical fields, including finance and accounting, at institutions such as the Harvard Business School, Fort Hare University, Cranfield University (UK), AAA School of Advertising and IMM. Dladla is a seasoned business leader with impeccable credentials. His business acumen, which includes his commendable knowledge of Eskom intricacies, will come in handy in his new role. As the board, we are looking forward to working with him and his executive team to address the current challenges, said Khoza. The minister has urged the board to finalise the appointment of a permanent group CEO to ensure long-term stability for the utility.
