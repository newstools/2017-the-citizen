Orlando Pirates lost 4-1 to Supersport United in the Nedbank Cup final at Moses Mabhida stadium on Saturday night and left fans and politicians alike disappointed. SSU beat the Soweto giant, which has been making a habit of losing by a big margin lately, and will represent the country in the CAF Confederations in 2017/18. Pirates have been trending on Twitter since. EFF leader Julius Malema is one of the politicians who did not hold back from expressing his frustrations on social media. Consulting top legal minds regarding performance of @Orlando_Pirates, we feel very strong that the matter should go 2 the Con Court, hai man &mdash; Julius Sello Malema (@Julius_S_Malema) June 25, 2017 Taking to Twitter on Sunday, Malema said he was &#8220;consulting top legal minds&#8221; regarding Orlando Pirates&#8217; embarrassing performance last night. &#8220;We feel very strong that the matter should go to the Constitutional Court, hai man,&#8221; complained Malema on Twitter. It was SuperSport United coach Stuart Baxter&#8217;s last day at the office yesterday and he will be coaching Bafana Bafana, but Malema said his presence at the match was &#8220;corruption&#8221;. Why was Bafana Bafana couch involved in the first place, its corruption. We need judicial review of that game or even commission of enquiry &mdash; Julius Sello Malema (@Julius_S_Malema) June 25, 2017 &#8220;Why was Bafana Bafana coach involved in the first place, its corruption. We need judicial review of that game or even commission of enquiry,&#8221; he said. Malema said the same thing earlier this year after Pirates lost 6-1 to Mamelodi Sundowns, but this time, he said he hoped the controversial Gupta family was not involved. &#8220;Yeses! Can&#8217;t take this humiliation, something must be done,&#8221; he said. Obviously he did not mean all this, he was just a disappointed fan. Even EFF national spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi shared his thoughts on the loss. He said the EFF would do to the ruling party what SuperSport United did last night. These were some of the other reactions on Twitter: Ayikho lento ye nedbank iyathengwa I Pirates kudala I khona futhi ithandwa nga belungu ngumbedo lento..#NedbankCupFinal &mdash; RSA Police Minister (@MbalulaFikile) June 24, 2017 @Orlando_Pirates i think it&#39;s time some of players leave the Parktown station, it&#39;s been a year of heartbreak instead of celebration year. &mdash; Lawrence Duze (@lawrence_duze) June 25, 2017 Orlando Pirates and Babes Wodumo are on the same WhatsApp group &mdash; Toffoluxe (@ndhile_dlamini) June 25, 2017 Orlando Pirates need to restart everything, Chairman, Players even supporters!
