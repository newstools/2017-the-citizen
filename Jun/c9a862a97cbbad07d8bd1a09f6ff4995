Shortly after a suspect fled the Brackenfell area in Cape Town with a stolen Nissan Cabstar truck he was stopped in his tracks during a joint effort between police and private security personnel, Western Cape police said. During the early hours of Friday morning, the 27-year-old suspect from Harare in Khayelitsha stole the truck in Basset Street, Brackenfell, waking the owner who then alerted police, Lt-Col Andr Traut said. The exit routes from the area were immediately covered and he was spotted by a security patrol in Kuilsrivier. During the pursuit that followed, he abandoned the truck and was later arrested by members of the K9 unit while hiding in bushes in Saxton Road. The man was expected to appear in the Blue Downs Magistrate s Court on Monday. The security sector is an important partner of SAPS [South African Police Service] to strengthen us in curbing crime and it is their contribution which assisted us to reunite the owner with his truck within 15 minutes of the incident, Traut said.
