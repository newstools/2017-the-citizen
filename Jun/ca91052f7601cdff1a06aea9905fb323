The police have arrested six suspects for the murders of the three people whose bodies were found on Monday morning in an open veld in Centurion, Pretoria. The victims were bound, gagged and burnt. Provincial commissioner of the police Lieutenant-General Deliwe de Lange applauded the team of the Provincial Trio unit for arresting the suspects in the Northcliff case. Police spokesperson Captain Kay Makhubela said the police had gone all out since Monday after the kidnappings of three family members were reported. &#8220;Police have been following information of the whereabouts of the suspects until they tracked them down in various places in Gauteng. &#8220;The suspects were arrested last night at Zone 5 in Pimville, Soweto,&#8221; Makhubela said. The police also recovered a Mercedes-Benz stolen from the house robbery, electrical appliances and the Quantum used as a getaway vehicle. &#8220;The three bodies found in Centurion appeared to be the members of the Northcliff case, however, police are still waiting for the DNA results. &#8220;The suspects will appear at the Johannesburg Magistrates&#8217; Court soon facing charges of kidnapping, house robbery and murder,&#8221; Makhubela said.
