Last year December, AKA announced he was leaving his record label, Vth Season, and would be starting his own company, Beam Group. Although his music was still being released under the Vth Season reason, as of June 1, they mutually parted ways. It is with this growth and support structure that AKA and Raphael Benza of Vth Season have now mutually parted ways in all forms of their business relationship, as of June 1, 2017, the statement reads. The move was inspired by AKA&#8217;s dream to start building his own legacy. &#8220;I have the utmost respect for the Vth Season team. Together, we created magic. I have learnt a lot from the music industry, and it&#8217;s time for me to start building my own legacy and become South Africa&#8217;s first Music Mogul,&#8221; AKA said in a statement. &#8220;The process of establishing BEAM from scratch has not been easy, but has been liberating, as I have a great business team to lean on. Thus BEAM&#8217;s focus is not just music, as my ultimate aim is to be a multi-investor, with success in different industries,&#8221; he added.
