Amber Rose on Friday posted a picture of herself without trousers or underwear showing her unshaven regions, urging followers to &#8220;bring back the bush&#8221;. She has been trending since. Instagram, however, could not handle the heat as it removed the picture just a few hours after being posted, but she hit back with a video of herself rolling her eyes and said: When IG deletes ur fire ass feminist post but you really don t give a fuck because everyone picked it up already.&#8221; She posted the picture to promote the Amber Rose SlutWalk, which is a peaceful protest held yearly to raise awareness about sexual injustice and gender equality. A description on the website reads: [Our mission is] to deliver a flawlessly executed event geared toward raising awareness about sexual injustice and gender inequality. The Amber Rose SlutWalk aims to impact and uplift, while shifting the paradigm of rape culture. The event provides a safe, all-inclusive space to entertain, educate, and empower. However, the picture has divided the internet, with some saying her picture was wrong and had nothing to do with gender equality, while some said she had every right to post the picture. Amber Rose has left even former womaniser Kenny Kunene speechless, taking to Twitter to share his what he thought. He shared the picture on his timeline and wrote: &#8220;Oh my word!&#8221; Social media users have also started The Amber Rose Challenge, posting pictures of themselves mimicking the model&#8217;s pose. Check out some of the pictures below: Amber Rose challenge anyone?
