A Bonaero Park woman, on the East Rand was rushed to hospital after suffering burns when a gas bottle exploded and set her house alight on Friday afternoon. A neighbour told the Kempton Express the woman, who was living alone on Malpensa Road, suffered burns trying to salvage some valuables and save her dog. She said neighbours heard two loud explosions. This woman is really having bad luck. Last year she was renovating her house and a wall fell on her, said Vonita Viljoen of the CPF Sector Six. An elderly woman sustained burns as she went back inside the house to try and salvage some stuff and try to save her dog. Photograph supplied Craig, the woman s neighbour, saved her life when he dragged her away from the house as she was trying to go inside. He took it upon himself to save the woman s dog. The dog is safe and in the care of Craig, Viljoen said. This woman lost everything in this massive fire. The only part of the house left is the garage. What is also sad about this whole thing is that the house was for sale. As neighbours we tried to salvage some of her valuables but there was really not much to save except a photo album that did not burn, said Kerry Field, another neighbour. Not much is left of the bedroom. Photograph supplied &nbsp; The woman is said to have lost almost everything in the fire.
