The first video recorded by Babes and her manager, Mampintsha right after the South African Music Awards, saw her complain about losing out on all the categories she was nominated in. When she didn&#8217;t win at the Metro FM awards earlier this year, Babes was furious and said she would boycott award ceremonies for not rewarding her hardwork. Reports suggested she was in a state and had even been spotted crying after the radio station&#8217;s ceremony in Durban. Babes has said that she couldn&#8217;t understand why artists who weren&#8217;t fully booked like she was were winning awards. Though she posted another video apologising for the first, she told Drum magazine that the apology was for the fans and not the Samas and that the ceremony was rigged. &#8220;Apart from the Song of the Year and Newcomer accolades, I was hoping for Best Kwaito award too. My album makes people dance. &#8220;The so-called judges and the panel don&#8217;t get the gqom sound. Awards are no longer the same. They are no longer about celebrating good songs,&#8221; said Babes. About her apology, Babes said it wasn&#8217;t right for their fans to see them using swear words because they were considered role models. Babes is nominated for a BET award together with Nasty C.
