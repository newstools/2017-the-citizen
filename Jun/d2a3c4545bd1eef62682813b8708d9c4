The 20-year-old was a guest on Sway in the Morning, a popular hip-hop radio show in the US. Nasty C is currently overseas, where he was invited to attend the BET Awards in Los Angeles, California. He was nominated for an international award for his debut album, Bad Hair. &#8220;If you went to a multiracial school right now in the States, racism would be rearing its ugly face at an all-time high. It never left. It was kind of just cloaked behind the curtain, but now it&#8217;s not fooling anybody,&#8221; Sway said. &#8220;We know it&#8217;s there. It&#8217;s in our system, [all walks] of life, advertising and in our messaging. What is it like over there?&#8221; he asked. Nasty C replied that he did not want to speak for everyone else, but he had never experienced any kind of racism in his life. &#8220;I&#8217;ve never been deprived of an opportunity because of the colour of my skin,&#8221; said the rapper, shaking his head. &#8220;You could date white and no one would frown at you?&#8221; Sway asked. &#8220;People would congratulate me for dating white,&#8221; Nasty C replied.
