AgriSA said on Thursday that agriculture was a shining light in South Africa s declining economy following its 12.8 percent positive contribution to the Gross domestic product (GDP) for the first quarter of 2017. This follows news released by Statistics South Africa that the economy contracted by 0.7 percent for the first quarter of 2017, following a decrease of 0.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016, indicating that the country has fallen into a technical recession. The biggest negative driver for the first quarter was the trade, catering and accommodation industry, which shrank by 5.9 percent. Manufacturing declined by 3.7 percent and household consumption by 2.3 percent. In a statement, AgriSA said the situation could have been far worse had it not been for the agricultural sector s contribution to GDP and a year-on-year growth rate of 22 percent upwards. The federation of agricultural organisations said it was committed to the development of agriculture in South Africa, and was quite pleased with the positive performance of the sector. This speaks volumes of the importance of the sector in the economy, and therefore as Agri SA we continue in our endeavours to reach out to government to make agriculture development a national priority, AgriSA said. Most importantly we appeal for clear policy certainty with regards to land ownership, as we are concerned that without security of tenure the South African economy and food security will be compromised further. Agri SA said it was concerned that if South Africa s economic growth slips further into the negative territory in the second quarter, it would mean the country is in full recession. The organisation said it was concerned that the recession would lead to lower investment, and therefore to the undesirable damage in the long-term productive capacity of the economy.
