Tens of thousands of men from around South Africa are expected to descend on the KwaZulu-Natal South Coast town of Amanzimtoti to hear Christian evangelist Angus Buchan, at his annual Mighty Men Conference. Previous events across the country have attracted hundreds of thousands of participants. Early this year, Buchan s It s Time conference, held on a farm outside Bloemfontein, drew large crowds. The 2017 Mighty Men Conference will be held from July 7 to 9 at Amanzimtoti s Kuswag High School. Event organiser Freddie van Vuuren said: We are delighted to be returning to this welcoming community for a fourth year and are excited to continue the positive energy flowing from the It s Time congregation that will accompany Buchan to this year s Mighty Men Conference. He will be joined by community leaders Dr Anthony Jacobs and Pastor Andrew Anderson, who will continue the message of restitution with a focus on nurturing the father-son relationship and improving relations within our households, community and country. Jacobs, who is presiding pastor at Kingsway Ministries in Amanzimtoti, has managed a Bible school and has been on stage at Mighty Men events since 2015. His passion for theological teaching and helping people was evident during his Mighty Men appearances, which have been well received. Empangeni-based Anderson is a livestock farmer who was schooled under Buchan. Sapphire Coast Tourism chairperson Monique Botha said they were excited to again be a part of this popular annual event. We look forward to welcoming the Mighty Men Conference back to Amanzimtoti this year as it always receives such a positive response from the community and further afield, said Botha. Access to the event venue, the talks and use of all camping facilities are free of charge.
