The Bulls&#8217; final three Super Rugby matches will be Adriaan Strauss&#8217; last for the rest of the 2017 season. The former Springboks captain has declined to play in this year&#8217;s Currie Cup but, interestingly, he&#8217;s not going to cash in with a stint in Japan like numerous other local players.

Ever since becoming a star for the Cheetahs before his move back to Pretoria, the 31-year-old has established burgeoning business interests for himself. And Strauss believes some good, old-fashioned office work is the tonic he needs to rejuvenate himself for 2018. &#8220;I&#8217;m definitely not going to play any rugby after the current Super Rugby campaign. I can assure everyone of that,&#8221; he said on Wednesday. &#8220;I know it sounds weird coming from a professional rugby player but I&#8217;m actually going to go into an office and work from eight to four. I&#8217;m looking forward to it.&#8221; That plan need not spook Bulls fans who were hoping Strauss could be one of a few wise veterans to help usher in the new John Mitchell-era. &#8220;I&#8217;m not playing Currie Cup but I&#8217;ve still got some time left at the union,&#8221; said Strauss, whose contract with the Bulls actually only expires in 2019. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to work in the gym and keep my conditioning up to standard and obviously do some office work.&#8221; Strauss deserves the rest as he&#8217;s actually come off a rough three years. His return to Loftus coincided with a crumbling marriage before he skippered the Springboks in their depressing 2016 campaign and then coming under fire for his poor form this year. &#8220;I want to recover a bit from this year. I&#8217;ve been involved in rugby quite a lot the last few years,&#8221; said Strauss. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t get a lot of rest and certainly didn&#8217;t miss a lot of games. I think it will be good for the body and mind just to take a breather.&#8221; Having handed the Springboks&#8217; captaincy reigns to Warren Whiteley, Strauss is excited by the new vibe in the national team. &#8220;It&#8217;s exciting, there&#8217;s a lot of energy in that camp,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s great to see them get results. We as a country needed that.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter. Would you like to place a rugby bet? Click here to get started in 3 easy steps.
