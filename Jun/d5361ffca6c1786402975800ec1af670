A group of men were caught with a bag full of house-breaking equipment and remote jammers when they were trying to steal a truck in Centurion on Tuesday morning. Police spokesperson Captain Augustinah Selepe said police on patrol spotted the four men when they were trying to steal a truck in Wierdapark. Immediately after noticing the police, they fled the scene in a white Polo. Through well-established partnership with security companies and a chase, the suspects were nabbed by a Copwatch tactical official. Upon searching the men, police found over 15 screwdrivers, five remotes, lock cutters, three cellphones, a toolbox and four remotes. The suspects will appear before the Pretoria Magistrates&#8217; Court on charges of possession of stolen property, possession of house- and car-breaking implements and reckless and negligence driving. More charges were expected to be added, Selepe said. rorisangk@citizen.co.za
