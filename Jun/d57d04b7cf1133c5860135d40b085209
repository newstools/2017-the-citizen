Western Cape Premier Helen Zille, MECs, as well as mayors from across the province, on Wednesday signed a municipal water declaration as part of efforts to secure the region s water security. The declaration, which was signed in Worcester, was a result of the outcomes of the Western Cape Water Indaba held recently to address the ongoing drought in the province and the issue around water scarcity. According to a statement by Local Government, Environmental Affairs and Development Planning MEC Anton Bredell an in-depth review of the Sustainable Water Management Plan (SWMP) was currently under way for the province. This plan provides the strategic framework for water management in the Western Cape, and it will guide and inform us as to the decisions we need to make going forward, said Bredell. The declaration listed seven key points, including enhancing water conservation efforts by adopting water sensitive urban design planning principles to permanently reduce the individual demand on water resources, reducing water leakages, diversifying water supply, recognising the need to manage groundwater wisely, protecting the quality and integrity of water resources, legislative overhaul in areas where needed and driving water innovation. Zille said that the declaration would commit provincial and local government leaders towards greater water security in the medium to long term. The main aim of this declaration is to accelerate action towards responsible and sustainable water use in the Western Cape, said Zille.
