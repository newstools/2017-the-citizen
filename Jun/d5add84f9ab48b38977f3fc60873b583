The Gupta family is uniting the country against the ANC, according to ANC veteran and millionaire businessman Tokyo Sexwale. He was speaking during a briefing held at Trillian Capital Partners regarding corruption allegations at the Gupta-linked company he recently resigned from. Trillian, according to a recent report, received millions in payment for work done for state utility Eskom without a contract or a tender. This was in relation to an insurance claim at Eskom&#8217;s Duvha plant, which Trillian allegedly provided services to, including sourcing a new supplier and negotiating a settlement with the insurer. Sexwale&#8217;s tone turned emotional as he described how the Gupta scandals were tearing the ANC and its alliance partners apart. &#8220;This corruption, this particular one, is uniting South Africans against us as the ANC. This particular corruption, family related, is ruining relationships among families and friends who don&#8217;t talk to one another any more, where people never see eye to eye any more.&#8221;
