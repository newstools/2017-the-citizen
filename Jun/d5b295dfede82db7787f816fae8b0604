Three people have been arrested in a drugs sting operation by Cape Town policing cluster task team officers near the Cape Peninsula University of Technology (CPUT) this week, Western Cape police said on Sunday. A taxi driver with a CPUT student and another male were arrested when they sold dagga to an undercover member of the task team. The three suspects are aged between 23 and 26, Captain FC van Wyk said. The deal was set up with the supplier and the agent got into the suspect s vehicle and they tried to drive off with the member. But the rest of the task team were quick to react and the vehicle was stopped on the corners of Sir Lowry and Sydney roads and searched, he said. During the search, the officers found money and more dagga in the vehicle as well as the money used by the undercover agent to buy the dagga. While searching the vehicle, it became known that the suspects had a second vehicle and it was searched as well. A bigger amount of dagga was found in the second vehicle. Both vehicles were seized and impounded as it was used in the commission of a crime. The value of the dagga is estimated at a street value of R15,000. The suspects were due to appear in the Cape Town Magistrate s Court on Monday on charges of dealing in drugs, Van Wyk said.
