Poet and singer Ntsiki Mazwai is back on the music scene after taking some time off to focus on her master s degree. Mazwai has told SA Music Mag that she is confident with her rap career, but she is skeptical whether she will get any airplay on radio. I just finished working on a track that I think is going to be super big. It s a rap song, which is different because I never thought that I would ever do rap music again, she said. I heard the beat and immediately realised that I had to drop some bars on it. I hadn t rapped in years. Now I think this is the perfect time to make a return to that side of music. It s not going to be played on radio because it speaks to the government and the leadership in this country. We will be dropping it online, and hopefully it goes viral so that everyone can hear it, she said about her new hit, produced by KB. She went on to say her passion for rap was ignited after hearing a dope beat and realising it was the perfect time for her to make a comeback. ALSO READ: Ntsiki Mazwai graduates cum laude
