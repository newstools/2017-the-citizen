The trial of former Democratic Alliance (DA) councillor Wilma Brady on multiple counts of fraud was on Wednesday postponed to August. The case stems from her alleged illegal authorisation for the construction of houses on provincial land in Delft. Brady is on trial in the Specialised Commercial Crime Court in Bellville and has pleaded not guilty to 33 counts of fraud. Brady was absent when her case was called on Wednesday, but prosecutor Ezmarelda Johnson explained that the matter could not proceed in any event because a witness that the state wished to call was unable to attend the proceedings. The prosecutor said she had informed Brady of the situation and had excused her from attendance. At the prosecutor s request, the case was postponed to August 10. The hearing revolves around a letter Brady allegedly signed in 2006, authorising the company, Lelethu Properties and Development, to build 33 houses on provincial land in Delft. A disciplinary committee convened by the DA at the time found Brady guilty of contravening the Code of Conduct pertaining to councillors, and recommended a fine of R5 000. The state alleges that Brady fraudulently authorised, in her capacity as a councillor, the illegal building of the 33 dwellings for people, including her own uncle and sister.
