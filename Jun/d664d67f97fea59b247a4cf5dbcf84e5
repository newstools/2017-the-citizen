Former Eskom board chairperson Ben Ngubane has come out guns blazing against former public protector Thuli Madonsela and then finance minister Pravin Gordhan, accusing the pair of colluding to &#8220;hurry up the latter s controversial State of Capture report. Ngubane in an interview on Tuesday evening with Gupta-owned news channel ANN7 alleged that Gordhan had paid Madonsela R5 million to fast-track the release of her report into allegations of improper conduct and undue influence exerted by the Gupta family over politicians, state-owned companies and their boards through their close friendship with President Jacob Zuma. It was in the dying days of Thuli Madonsela s contract as a public protector. That is why we were not even given a chance or a hearing. Our documents we submitted were never studied, he said. That s why the report was hastily produced without findings mind you but only remedial action requiring a judicial commission. On Monday, Ngubane abruptly resigned from the Eskom board amid a slew of corruption allegations mounting against him contained in leaked email communication between the Guptas and their associates, as well as an upcoming parliamentary inquiry into malfeasance at the power utility. He said he resigned for personal reasons and had nothing to fear, saying he decided it would be wise for him to step down and seize the opportunity and tender my resignation so I can get into private business as quickly as possible . In response to the allegations, Madonsela told TimesLIVE Ngubane was untruthful and her request for additional funding while in office had been made openly to government. She said she had asked for R3 million, but only received R1.5 million at the time, which was too little too late . Gordhan has refused to comment on the claims, as he is now longer the finance minister. Watch the video below: ALSO READ: #GuptaLeaks: former Eskom CEO s CV passed to Guptas before appointment
