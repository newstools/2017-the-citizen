Blade Nzimande, the minister of higher education managed to turn the funeral of his mother into a political affair by telling mourners they should not sell their souls for money. According to Sunday Times, he was speaking to a crowd which included ANC comrades such as KwaZulu-Natal Premier Willies Mchunu, Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi Human Settlements Minister Lindiwe Sisulu and Cosatu president S&#8217;dumo Dlamini. &#8220;I will forever be indebted to her. She taught me that your dignity as a person and a human being is not for sale and cannot be sold no matter how poor you are.&#8221; &#8220;And we need this thing now even more because we have this problem in our country of people who are selling their souls and their dignity for a pence.&#8221; He also commented on tenderpreneurs and how easily they lost out on money earned from government projects. &#8220;One thing I celebrate about my mother is that she took me to school. It&#8217;s not like a tender. You get a tender today and you lose it tomorrow. But no one can take education from you.&#8221; Nzimande and the SACP have become increasingly critical of President Jacob Zuma. The communist party called for Zuma&#8217;s resignation almost two months ago, citing the scourge of corruption which has engulfed the ruling party under his leadership. Earlier today, the West Rand ANC endorsed Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa to take over from Zuma as the next president of the ANC.
