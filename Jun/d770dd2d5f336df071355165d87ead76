Given how Steven Kitshoff delighted all and sundry in the Springboks&#8217; series against France, you&#8217;d think the Stormers would waste little time picking him for Saturday&#8217;s Super Rugby derby against the Cheetahs. And by all accounts, coach Robbie Fleck would love to too. But it&#8217;s not as simple as it sounds. Also read: Bulls pivot Handre Pollard s wretched luck continues Last month, Kitshoff signed a national contract with SA Rugby and the Stormers after a two-year stint with French side Bordeaux. His agreement with the Stormers officially begins on Saturday, the day of the match. &#8220;Kitsie is available to play,&#8221; Fleck confirmed. The problem is, currently Kitshoff can only play in the Stormers&#8217; last three round-robin matches. Sanzar regulations state that those three games would be insufficient for him to play in the knock-out phase as players need to have played at least five times during the season. As a result, the question becomes: Is it worth the trouble of playing Kitshoff now if you can&#8217;t use him in a quarterfinal? &#8220;When it comes to quarterfinals and semifinals, he&#8217;s not available,&#8221; said Fleck. &#8220;That is something that we&#8217;ll need to weigh up.&#8221; The Stormers mentor did mention that there are &#8220;extraordinary ways&#8221; for Kitshoff to actually play at the business end of the campaign but it&#8217;s highly unlikely. &#8220;It&#8217;s an issue that was actually discussed last year already,&#8221; said Fleck. &#8220;If there are a huge amount of injuries in one position, you can advocate for somebody to come in. But it requires special permission.&#8221; It&#8217;s obviously a dilemma, especially since Kitshoff could provide momentum for the Capetonians going into the knockout rounds. &#8220;We probably have to play the players who&#8217;ll actually be available for the quarterfinals. That said, we&#8217;re now only focusing on getting back on track and preparing for the Cheetahs. &#8220;We&#8217;ll select the best possible side for the game and if that includes Kitsie then that&#8217;s what we&#8217;ll do.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
