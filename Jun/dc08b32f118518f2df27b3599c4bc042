It was announced by the presidency on Thursday afternoon that President Jacob Zuma has replaced Phahlane with Lieutenant-General Lesetja Mothiba as the acting head of the SA Police Service (SAPS). The current commissioner, General Riah Phiyega, has been on suspension since October 2015. Phahlane has faced scandals of his own during his tenure as acting boss following allegations of impropriety around the purchase of his home and improvements on it. He has been the subject of an Independent Police Investigative Directorate investigation. Mothiba was previously the Gauteng police commissioner before being redeployed to a new management intervention unit in the SAPS&#8217;s head office. He is a career policeman with more than 30 years of police experience. Lieutenant-General Mothiba is now the Acting National Commissioner of SAPS.
