If you have never before seen ANC Women&#8217;s League leader, Social Development Minister and one-time convicted fraudster Bathabile Dlamini all laid back and posing for pictures like she&#8217;s about to give up all the stress that comes with mismanaging a government department in favour of a new career as a catalogue model, then this is your lucky day. In new pictures circulating on social media, Dlamini made us realise we had never before seen her rocking a pair of jeans and Chuck Taylors, and we&#8217;ve hardly ever seen her smiling (probably because we only ever get to see her reaction to having to defend unconstitutional deals to pay out social grants, never the big grin she might have when she&#8217;s actually first agreeing to such deals). The Dlamini we have come to know is the po-faced woman in a dress in parliament, either defending herself against Sassa issues or denying that she drinks alcohol. And boy oh boy, have we been missing out. The minister can here be seen posing for pictures like she&#8217;s about to overtake Minnie Dlamini as the new queen of Instagram (sorry Minnie, and you only just took top spot!), presumably with one of her children behind the camera, as the setting looks like she was in a house in a nice suburb somewhere in Joburg.
