Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema s land invasion case was postponed to October in the Bloemfontein Magistrates Court on Monday. Malema faces charges of incitement after he allegedly urged people to occupy vacant land during the EFF elective conference in Bloemfontein in 2014. He repeated the same call in June last year near Madadeni, KwaZulu-Natal. The state requested a postponement to October 27 to allow Malema to petition the Constitutional Court regarding the charges. The red berets&#8217; leader is challenging the Riotous Assemblies Act of 1956 under, which he was charged. He is challenging the constitutionality of the apartheid-era law, which he claimed was illegal. For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
