When a cellphone was heard ringing in the isolated area of Nsuze yesterday evening, it was traced to the pocket of a dead man hanging from a tree on the edge of a cliff. IPSS Medical Rescue spokesperson Paul Herbst said together with Durban K9SAR and Umhlali K9SAR dog units they managed to retrieve the man who was hanging in a very difficult to reach spot, reports the North Coast Courier. The tree was situated at the edge of a cliff with a drop off of about 300m. The 48-year-old man was retrieved using a rope rescue system, said Herbst. Umhlali K9SAR s Sergeant Clinton Odayar said they did not suspect foul play. The community said the man had been missing since Tuesday and that people had been trying to phone him, but no one answered, said Odayar. Caxton News Service
