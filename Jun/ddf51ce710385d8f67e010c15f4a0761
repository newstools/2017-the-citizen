When it comes to the juveniles this season trainer Sean Tarry ap pears to have an embarrassment of riches. When one considers the quality of his runners left in Joburg, it just makes one wonder how good are those competing in the Grade 2 features at Greyville tomorrow. An example of this is Aurelia Cotta who runs in Race 2. This daughter of Ashaawes has raced twice for two facile wins. She shows excellent acceleration and it would have come as no sur prise to see her contesting the Golden Slipper. Both of her victories have come over 1400m on this Standside track and over the same course and distance it would take Dutch courage to back against her al though the handicappers have a different interpretation of the re sults. Aurelia Cotta has no official merit rating but there are unof ficial ratings and she is regarded as an 85. However, she is not the highest rated runner. That goes to Twelve Oaks who has raced in feature company and has earned a rating of 94 while Paul Peter-trained Folk Dance who has also won twice in two starts, is rated 93. Just how accurate the unoffi cial ratings turn out to be will be tested in this event. Tarry could also be on the mark in Race 6, a MR 85 Handicap over 1600m, where he sends out Yankee Captain. He and Maximizer met last time over the same course and distance and Peter s charge won by a neck. This time Yankee Captain is 1kg better off and should reverse the placings. Of course, the Vodacom Dur ban July features on the card as Race 7, and for those who are una ble to get to Greyville, Turffontein will provide much of the glitz and glamour.
