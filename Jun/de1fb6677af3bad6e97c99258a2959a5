A woman died soon after she was hit by a motorcycle while crossing the M19 westbound near the N2 bridge in Durban on Friday night, paramedics said.

The biker had sustained moderate injuries while the pedestrian had sustained critical injuries. Advanced life support paramedics worked on both the injured. However, the pedestrian had sustained major injuries and despite paramedics efforts she passed away on the scene. The biker was transported to a nearby hospital for the further care that he required, he said. For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
