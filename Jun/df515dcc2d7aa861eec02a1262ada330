Businessman and international rap star Jay-Z released his 13th studio album on Friday, June 30, titled 4:44. The rapper has kept the details of his marriage under wraps for years, but the artist has bared himself like never in his new album. Just over a year after the release of his wife s album, Lemonade, which hinted that Jay Z had been cheating on her. Jay Z delivers a long-awaited public reply to Beyonce by apologising for cheating on her. I apologise/ Our love was one for the ages and I contained us, Jay Z raps. The rapper also mentions that he almost went Eric Benet by letting the baddest girl in the world get away. The line seems to be a reference to R&amp;B singer Eric Benet, who divorced Halle Berry after he admitted cheating on her. Twitter users have not stopped talking about the release of the album, and especially his apology to Beyonc . &nbsp; You really let him cheat then give you twins. @Beyonce pic.twitter.com/xeprtyVbVq &mdash; XX (@StassDoll) June 30, 2017 Me talking to Beyonc after listening to 4:44 pic.twitter.com/MmrxWafg1F &mdash; Herman (@cjbydesign) June 30, 2017 Jay Z admit to cheating on Beyonc .
