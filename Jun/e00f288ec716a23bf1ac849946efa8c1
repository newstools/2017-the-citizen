The Proteas&#8217; early push for a place in the semifinals of the ICC Champions Trophy will start by batting first against Pakistan in Birmingham. Skipper AB de Villiers won the toss and decided to take first strike because of the nature of the pitch. &#8220;It&#8217;s a surface that has been used before, so we feel it&#8217;s important to get a total on the board,&#8221; he said in a television interview. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s going to take much turn but it&#8217;s definitely going to get slower.&#8221; Because of the theory that there won&#8217;t be too much turn, South Africa have decided to name an unchanged XI from the one that beat Sri Lanka at the weekend. Proteas: Quinton de Kock, Hashim Amla, Faf du Plessis, AB de Villiers, JP Duminy, David Miller, Chris Morris, Wayne Parnell, Kagiso Rabada, Morne Morkel, Imran Tahir.
