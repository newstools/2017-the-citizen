The National Council of SPCAs (NSPCA) recently seized about 1 000 donkey skins and seven tiger skins from a plot in Benoni, Ekurhuleni. The council responded to a tip-off and obtained a warrant to enter the plot. NSPCA inspectors, accompanied by Benoni SPCA, made the discovery, Kempton Express reports. Bales of donkey skins tied together with wire were found on the property. Tiger skins were also found concealed between the donkey skins. Paraphernalia linked to the illegal donkey skin trade were also found. The suspects fled the scene and abandoned the operation. Upon closer investigation, the inspectors observed that the slain donkeys appeared to have been hacked behind their necks to presumably render them paralysed in order for them to be skinned. In earlier donkey skin cases, the NSPCA made the shocking discovery that the donkeys were still alive, but paralysed or unconscious, while being skinned. The skins have been seized by the NSPCA and taken to a place of safety. The horrible donkey skin trade must come to an end. These animals suffer a horrendous and barbaric death. We urge the public to report such matters to the NSPCA, said senior inspector Grace de Lange, manager of the NSPCA Farm Animal Protection Unit. The NSPCA is in the process of taking further legal action and consulting with the relevant authorities. In January, between 300 and 400 donkey skins were found at a property in Crystal Park, Benoni. In February, 300 skins, destined for Hong Kong, were confiscated at OR Tambo International Airport. &#8211; Caxton News Service For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter
