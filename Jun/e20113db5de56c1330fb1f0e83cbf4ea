Lunga Mahoney Kolela, trending on Twitter as &#8216;Mahorny&#8217;, appeared on Sunday night&#8217;s episode of Date My Family and left social media on fire. Mahoney has been called an &#8220;arrogant&#8221; guy flexing with his inheritance money. &#8220;If you&#8217;re rich, you&#8217;re rich,&#8221; he said. The &#8216;activation coordinator&#8217; said he was looking for a potential wife who had everything going for her, just like him. His longest relationship was six months, which was three years ago, he told the first family. He then went on to tell the second family he last had a relationship two years ago. Mahoney put it on record that he did not just have a car but &#8220;many&#8221; of them, a claim that pleased Lerato, who said she was looking for a man who had a car. She said she was tired of taking taxis to visit people who did not appreciate her. She also received criticism of her own for making a comment that Mahoney was still &#8220;chubby&#8221; even after saying his hobby was running. Tiisetso, another contestant, was looking for a simple guy who earned an honest living, and was not willing to compromise on respect. Kwena was looking for a fun, smart man who was family oriented. She was impressed with Mahoney, and thought he could be the one. He ended up choosing her. She said he had &#8220;cute&#8221; lips, and felt like &#8220;swallowing&#8221; him during their date. He liked kids, but not &#8220;ugly&#8221; ones, he said. On a scale of affection between 1 and 50, Mahoney scored himself a 15, saying he did not put much effort into these relationship things. He has been criticised for saying he did not go around looking for relationships. &#8220;I don&#8217;t have time to fool around, I&#8217;m too busy,&#8221; he said. But then why was he on a dating show if he was not looking for a relationship? Twitter asked. When Twitter is not impressed with a contestant, the online detectives start digging up dirt on them, and Mahoney was no different from General or any other contestant who failed to impress. This time, Radio 702 presenter Eusebius McKaiser tweeted what left most asking if he implied he had dated Mahoney. &#8220;Ben 10s grow up so fast these days. You switch on the TV, and they are on Date My Family. Ps No fam, I&#8217;m not sharing any files,&#8221; he said. Ben 10s grow up so fast these days.

Mahoney said on Facebook that he had &#8220;turned&#8221; gay because he could not get girls.
