Shortly after leaving her job at Metro FM, Unathi made headlines for saying she was going to heed her ancestral calling. However, she has clarified that statement, explaining she was misquoted and that she was instead going to heal through song and not become a sangoma or a traditional healer. Speaking to Drum magazine, the singer said she had a spiritual calling but it was to heal through her music for now. At a later stage it could be through visions as &#8220;the spiritual world constantly evolves.&#8221; Unathi says her mother was also concerned about the reports she was supposedly becoming a sangoma. She had to calm her down and tell her there wasn&#8217;t any truth to them. &#8220;In 2006 a stranger walked up to me and said, &#8216;You are a born healer and one day you will heal through song. &#8220;I&#8217;ve learnt I have a healing ability and I&#8217;ve been told I will heal through song for now.&#8221; On returning to radio, Unathi said she was taking a break from the platform and would return after a year.
