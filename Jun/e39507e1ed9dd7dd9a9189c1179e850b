A picture of Social Development Minister and ANC Women&#8217;s League president Bathabile Dlamini has been circulating on social media. In the picture, young Dlamini is rocking longer and relaxed hair tied up and a green blouse. It was unclear as to where and when the picture was taken but it seems like a yearbook of some sort as her name can be seen written at the bottom of the picture. Check out the picture below of Dlamini, now 54 years old: Bathabile Dlamini. Picture: Twitter
