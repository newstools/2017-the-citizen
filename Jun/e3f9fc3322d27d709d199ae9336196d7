He might be one of the men at the forefront of the #SecretBallot case that was heard in the Constitutional Court but Bantu Holomisa still has time to keep an eye on the Proteas too. The leader of the United Democratic Movement (UDM) was clearly an interested observer after South Africa lost their first of three T20 matches against England in Southampton on Wednesday night. Holomisa singled out the erratic Wayne Parnell as one of the poorest performers in the thrashing by nine wickets. In a Facebook post, he notes how the left-arm quick is becoming too much of a risk for the Proteas to keep selecting &#8211; despite getting his surname horribly wrong. &#8220;#Proteas. This Pannel (sic) guy continues to cost Proteas,&#8221; Holomisa wrote. &#8220;He is too expensive.&#8221; Parnell copped renewed criticism after he conceded 25 runs in two overs, a spell that put England in command almost immediately. The Proteas only set a target of 143. The 27-year-old all-rounder continues to battle with inconsistency and has many wondering why he keeps getting the nod from the selectors.
