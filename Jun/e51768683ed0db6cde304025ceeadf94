Many of us may think, at this point, Bonang Matheba has achieved all her dreams, but it seems the presenter and model still has a lot more to accomplish before she taps out. Matheba&#8217;s exit from Metro FM left listeners upset, with most wondering if she would ever grace our airwaves. In an interview with The Sowetan, the Queen B said she would be off air for some time. Her exit from Metro, however, has not shaken her, as she knows her fans always have her back. &#8220;You should never mess with my supporters. Don&#8217;t touch them. I&#8217;m so grateful for the people that support me; because of them, I&#8217;m able to wake up every day and do what I love,&#8221; she told the publication. Matheba will be hosting the show, Houston Iconic Fashion Week with Ty Hunter, with Beyonce&#8217;s stylist in Houston, Texas, next month. Also next month, she will host the KFC Taste Kitchen when it premieres on Mzansi Magic. She has also been announced as the host of the inaugural DStv Mzansi Viewers&#8217; Choice Awards taking place in August, where she has been nominated for the Best Presenter award. With all of these achievements, one may be tempted to think Matheba has done it all, but it seems she still has a lot more to do. Matheba told the publication that before she dies, she would like to win an Emmy award for TV presenting. Also read: Bonang on her parents&#8217; divorce, what she spends her money on
