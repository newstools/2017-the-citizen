A bakkie was set alight when angry protesters burnt tyres and stoned vehicles along the Addo Road in Port Elizabeth on Tuesday. Police spokesperson, Captain Andre Beetge, said protests also flared up on the N2 where two busses, an ambulance and a truck were damaged. Beetge said that one bus was completely torched. The protest action initially started in Kamvelihle and then residents in Wells Estate started to protest around eviction notices which were served earlier in the day. Public Order Police were at various points where pockets of protest action took place in the area. Beetge said that it would appear that other grievances were around service delivery. Police are investigating cases of public violence and malicious damage to property.
