The Lions were handed the tough news on Tuesday that their inspirational captain Warren Whiteley won&#8217;t be seen in Red and White again in 2017. The Springboks&#8217; skipper has a pelvis injury and will be sidelined for 6 to 8 weeks. Also read: Super Rugby: Stormers have a Steven Kitshoff problem It&#8217;s exactly the type of setback the Lions didn&#8217;t need as Super Rugby reaches its business end, especially since Johan Ackermann&#8217;s troops look the only realistic South African candidate for the title. But there&#8217;s not shortage of talent that can fulfill Whiteley&#8217;s No 8 role. Ruan Ackermann The coach&#8217;s impressive 21-year-old son is arguably the closest to a like-for-like replacement. He has already shown his versatility by playing lock, flank and eighthman in his short career. Ackermann&#8217;s experience at lock means he can easily be the go-to line-out option Whiteley has become known for at Super Rugby and international level. Perhaps more exciting is the fact that, at 1,93m and 111 kg, Ackermann is the type of physical player that made Duane Vermeulen so special. Cyle Brink The Lions&#8217; team management has continually stated that they believe Brink can make a success of any role in a given loose trio. The 23-year-old is perhaps better known as as a tough ball-carrying blinside flanker who defends well but has in the past shown potential as an opensider. However, Brink&#8217;s appetite for getting around the park means he&#8217;s got potentially excellent linking abilities, a vital attribute for a No 8 in an attacking pattern like the Lions&#8217;. Jano Venter The man from Witbank is definitely a dark horse pick for Whiteley&#8217;s role but it&#8217;s eminently realistic. Venter has been in excellent form for the Golden Lions in the SuperSport Rugby Challenge, specifically in the No 8 jersey. At 1.92m and 103kg, the 23-year-old is the type of ball-carrier any top side craves. While he&#8217;s certainly got some silky skills, his general play reminds one more of the bustling Jaco Kriel. And given that he&#8217;s substantially bigger than Kriel, that&#8217;s a scary thought. Fabian Booysen The former Junior Springbok looked set for decent run in the Super Rugby side last season after performing well on tour. Then he suffered a nasty eyelid injury that kept him out for months. Booysen is not as flashy as some of his teammates but he&#8217;s supremely effective and also versatile. His line-out ability is a bonus. For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
