The Ahmed Kathrada Foundation on Monday said it welcomed a special sitting by the National Assembly on Tuesday afternoon to pay tribute to the late struggle stalwart, but said a more fitting tribute would be for MPs to support a vote of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma. The Foundation appreciates that the National Assembly is dedicating time to pay tribute to one of its first members. Kathrada served as a member of Parliament from 1994 to 1999. He was also President Nelson Mandela s parliamentary counsellor during that period, the Foundation said in a statement. However, a truly fitting statement to Kathrada would be to speak to the issue that troubled him up to his last days: the conduct of President Jacob Zuma. In this way, Parliament could fulfil its core obligations to the people of South Africa, and truly honour Ahmed Kathrada s memory. The Foundation said it was informed last week of the sitting and that the National Assembly invited Kathrada s widow, Barbara Hogan, and other members of the family. Kathrada s relatives, however, would be unable to attend. Due to the late notice and it being the Muslim month of Ramadaan, the Kathrada family will be unable to honour the invite. Hogan will also be unable to attend due to another family bereavement. Kathrada passed away on March 28 following complications from brain surgery. During his funeral the next day, former president Kgalema Motlanthe read out an open letter which Kathrada wrote to Zuma in 2016 in which he called on the President to resign in the light of allegations of state. The Kathrada Foundation urged MPs to support a motion of no confidene in accordance with the late struggle icon s wishes. If the National Assembly really wants to pay tribute to Kathrada, its members should have the courage of conviction that defined the Rivonia generation they must be able do the right thing and put the country first.
