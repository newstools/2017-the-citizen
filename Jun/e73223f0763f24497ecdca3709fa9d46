Nkosinathi &#8216;Black Coffee&#8217; Maphumulo and Enhle Mbali Maphumulo have been serving us relationship goals, and continue to do so when they share pictures of each other on social media. From their social media accounts, we can see the couple support each other&#8217;s projects, with Coffee having shared every magazine cover his wife has appeared on. Mbali is now on Elle Magazine&#8217;s latest issue, and said she kept it simple and stripped away everything that was considered beautiful. &#8220;No lashes, no contours, no highlights. No extensions, crazy? No, just redefining beauty,&#8221; she said, and we must say, the cover has done exactly that. Mbali talked to the magazine about her marriage and what love meant to her, among other subjects. &#8220;We break together, we rise together, that&#8217;s what love is for me,&#8221; she was quoted as saying by the magazine. As usual, her husband shared the cover and described their relationship in the most hilarious way. &#8220;Of all the frogs to kiss, she chose me,&#8221; Coffee said of his wife on Instagram. A post shared by Black Coffee (@realblackcoffee) on Jun 26, 2017 at 3:43am PDT Most the comments on his post called Coffee a &#8220;lucky frog&#8221; who turned out to be Mbali&#8217;s prince, and said they were one of Mzansi&#8217;s best couples. Coffee married his wife, who he called his &#8220;cherrie&#8221; in a glamorous white wedding at Sun City earlier this year, and continues to share love messages to his wife on social media. &#8220;Love doesn&#8217;t live here, but deep in our hearts. &#8220;Thank you for choosing me&#8230;.Thank you for a warm home and beautiful children&#8230;.in a world full of slayage thank you for remaining grounded&#8230;.I&#8217;ve learned a lot from you&#8230;I have no words to express my love and gratitude so here&#8217;s your own words&#8230;.Thank you for the wisdom,&#8221; he said in one of his posts.
