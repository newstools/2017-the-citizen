Kanye West&#8217;s wife, Kim Kardashian, can take the back seat as his ex-girlfriend Amber Rose has literally won the internet with her nude picture. Rose, known for her signature blonde cut, on Friday posted a picture of herself without trousers or underwear showing her unshaven regions and has been trending since. Instagram, however, could not handle the heat as it removed the picture just a few hours after being posted, but she hit back with a video of herself rolling her eyes and said: &#8220;When IG deletes ur fire ass feminist post but you really don&#8217;t give a fuck because everyone picked it up already #amberroseslutwalk #bringbackthebush.&#8221; A post shared by Amber Rose (@amberrose) on Jun 9, 2017 at 10:18pm PDT The picture, however, is still circulating on social media.
