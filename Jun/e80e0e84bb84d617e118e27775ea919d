Ideas on how to include exercises in your day Here are some simple ideas on how you can include little calorie burning exercises into your daily schedule: Drop down and do a few crunches before you get dressed for work in the morning. Alternatively, you can do a few push-ups whilst waiting for the water to boil for your cup of morning tea or coffee. If you enjoy dancing, you could even practise a few moves whilst blow-drying your hair or moisturising your skin. Incorporating these little exercises into your day will add up your efforts in burning some calories. Be creative, have fun and enjoy the advantages that exercise has to offer! Consult your doctor Always remember to consult with your doctor before starting any new exercise regime or making intense changes to your current one especially if you suffer from any medical conditions and for some reason are required not to place your body or yourself under any form of stress or strain.
