Parliament s management and the National Education, Health, and Allied Workers Union (Nehawu) have reached an agreement on salary increases for the 2017/18 financial year, according to a joint statement issued on Saturday. The salary increase of 7.5 percent takes effect retrospectively from 1 April 2017 and covers all employees in the bargaining unit, the statement said. Parliament s management and Nehawu agreed to the 7.5 percent salary increase as the best position, given the unfavourable economic climate in the country and budget cuts by the National Treasury. There was also agreement to work together to build sound labour relations and to address institutional problems, including the under-funding of Parliament as one of the three arms of the state. Collaboration would also include matters of mutual interest that went beyond bread and butter issues. Negotiations will continue on other outstanding matters through institutionalised platforms outlined in the recognition agreement, including monthly management and Nehawu meetings. The institution had also declared the same percentage increase to employees outside the bargaining unit, except the executive management who would not get any salary increase in 2017/18. Appreciation is extended to the presiding officers of the National Assembly and the National Council of Provinces, led by Speaker Baleka Mbete and chairperson Thandi Modise, for their guidance during the negotiations, the joint statement said.
