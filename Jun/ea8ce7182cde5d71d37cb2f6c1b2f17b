Siyasanga Mbambani, the state photographer who was involved in a messy text scandal last month with Radebe, has now turned her attention to her ex-boyfriend, Luyanda Potwana, who presents Nyan&#8217;Nyan. Move! magazine reports that Siyasanga is aware that Luyanda has moved on, but she won&#8217;t give up on trying to get back together with him. Insiders reportedly say Luyanada has even gone as far as to block the messages sent by Siyasanga in a bid to save his new relationship. &#8220;She is still obsessed with Luyanda and believes she still stands a chance of getting back together with him. However, the problem is that Luyanda is now in a relationship. But Siyasanga sends him kinky text messages as she knows he can&#8217;t resist her. &#8220;She still feels that Luyanda is her man, even though she dumped him, thinking he was broke,&#8221; said the source. Another source said Luyanda was scared he would be exposed on his show. He declined to comment to Move! and referred questions to his publicist, who said he would not comment on his client&#8217;s personal matters.
