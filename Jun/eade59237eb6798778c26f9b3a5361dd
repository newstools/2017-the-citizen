Bruce Bvuma has apparently been given a raw deal at Kaizer Chiefs after reports emerged he earns R5k a month. Bvuma joined the soccer club in March and has had to make do with the paltry salary which barely covers his transport costs and doesn&#8217;t allow him to have a cellphone or move into his own place. According to Sunday World, Bobby Motaung, Kaizer Chiefs manager has declined to comment. &#8220;Whether you are telling the truth or not I cannot comment because I don&#8217;t talk about players contracts in the media.&#8221; DJ Cleo, who manages Bvuma said he would not be drawn into discussing his client&#8217;s salary as it was disrespectful. Bvuma&#8217;s contract details how he will earn R8k from August, then R10k from August 2018 and R12k in 2019 and at the end of his contract this will increase to R15k per month. A source told Sunday World, Bvuma was keen on the exposure of playing for a big team and signed the contract with his eyes closed. &#8220;These are the things that kill our players because the public is expecting a player at this level and from such a club to be earning well. When he can&#8217;t meet those public expectations, then he gets psychologically disturbed and will not flourish as a player,&#8221; the source said. SA Football Players Union spokesperson Vusi Ntimane said the PSL was to blame for soccer players being exploited as they had not signed a minimum wage deal.
