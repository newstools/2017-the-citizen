The Proteas have rested some key players for the T20 series against England starting next week. Instead, a few men on the fringes of selection &#8211; and currently on tour with South Africa A &#8211; have been summoned for the three-match battle. Also read: Proteas choking explained: It s all fear of failure But their form over the past few weeks hasn&#8217;t exactly been great. Reeza Hendricks The Highveld Lions opener has been one of the exceptions on the A-tour. After a poor start, the right-hander burst to life with sprightly, unbeaten 68 off 65 in a rain-abandoned warm-up game against Derbyshire. Hendricks, however, showed his true mettle in the first &#8220;ODI&#8221; against England &#8216;A&#8217;, where he hit 11 fours in an excellent 79 off just 73 balls. He only managed four in his next game. Mangaliso Mosehle The diminutive wicketkeeper-batsman hasn&#8217;t been done many favours by the English weather. He didn&#8217;t get to bat in any of SA A&#8217;s warm-up matches due to the rain and essentially went into the series against England &#8220;cold&#8221;. Mosehle scored five in his only innings and was dropped in favour of veteran Heino Kuhn. Jon-Jon Smuts Another player whose limitations have been exposed to some degree. Despite making starts in two of his innings against England A &#8211; 15 and 22 &#8211; he was bowled on both occasions by tweaker Liam Dawson, confirming his weakness against spin. That&#8217;s actually already known at domestic level. The Warriors captain bowled tidy spin in the first &#8220;ODI&#8221; but got hammered in the second. Dane Paterson The hard-working Cobras seamer bowled poorly in the one-day matches against England A, getting pasted for runs at over six per over. But he made an immediate impact with the red ball, delivering a magnificent spell of 7/27 in the warm-up match against Hampshire. Hopefully that gives Paterson some confidence in the conditions. Tabraiz Shamsi The left-arm wrist spinner will once again be used by the Proteas as their &#8220;mystery&#8221; bowler. Yet his opportunities on the A-tour have been limited. In fact, he&#8217;s only bowled once on the whole tour and took 1/65 in 10 overs.
