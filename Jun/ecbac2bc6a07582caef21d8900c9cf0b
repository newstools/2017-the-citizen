The correctional services department has launched a manhunt for a long-term prisoner who escaped from St Albans prison on the outskirts of Port Elizabeth on Friday. This case has been reported to the SAPS [South African Police Service] and an internal investigation launched in order to determine the circumstances under which this offender managed to escape, department spokesperson Singabakho Nxumalo said on Saturday. Phumzile Langeni was serving a 30-year sentence for multiple cases of robbery, attempted murder and possession of unlicensed firearms. The department appealed to everyone who might know his whereabouts to assist with information that could lead to his re-arrest. The public was further advised to immediately contact their nearest police station and not attempt to apprehend Langeni, Nxumalo said.
