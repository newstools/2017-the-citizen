A truck driver, believed to be in his 30s, was killed when his truck overturned on the R33 in New Hanover in the KwaZulu-Natal midlands on Saturday, paramedics said. ER24 paramedics arrived on the scene to find a large truck, carrying ore, on its side on the side of the road, ER24 spokesman Russel Meiring said. Upon closer inspection, paramedics found the body of the driver lying trapped beneath the cab of the truck. Rescue services had to use specialised equipment to lift the truck, freeing the man. Upon further assessment, paramedics found that the man had sustained numerous injuries and showed no signs of life. Unfortunately nothing could be done for the man and he was declared dead on the scene. It was believed that the driver lost control of the truck, causing it to crash into the side of the road and eject the driver and trapping him beneath the vehicle, Meiring said.
