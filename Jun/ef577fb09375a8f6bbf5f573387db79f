It says much of the impact Curwin Bosch has made in Super Rugby this year that one feels disappointed when he&#8217;s picked at fullback. And that sentiment was keenly felt this week after the 19-year-old Junior Springbok was selected to wear the No 15 jersey against the Bulls at Kings Park on Friday evening. Also read: Super Rugby: Jaco Kriel isn t going anywhere yet When Bosch plays as the last line of defence, one merely considers him a talented youngster making his way to the top. Yet when he&#8217;s playing flyhalf, he&#8217;s the gifted teenager able to handle the most severe of pressure. That&#8217;s how the two positions differ in its perceptions. At 15, you&#8217;ve got time and space. At 10, everything is rushed and snap decision-making important &#8211; in other words, a difficult position. Given that Bosch&#8217;s best performances in this campaign have been at flyhalf, it&#8217;s no wonder people are excited. But some average showings for the Junior Springboks at the recently concluded Under-20 World Championships have brought everyone back down to earth to an extent. It also explains why Sharks coach Robert du Preez has switched Bosch back to the &#8220;relative safety&#8221; of fullback. &#8220;Curwin has played really well for us at 15 this season,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So I think the selection this week works for us.&#8221; Perhaps Du Preez is wise not to make too much of a fuss about it. In fact, it merely confirms the still untapped talent of Garth April. The 25-year-old impressed in patches last year (and enough to be included in Allister Coetzee&#8217;s first ever Springboks squad) and has done so again in 2017. &#8220;Garth did really well for us against the Stormers (before the international break),&#8221; said Du Preez. &#8220;The way he defended and attacked the gainline really stood out for us. I just felt it was justified to reward him by keeping him at flyhalf.&#8221; It&#8217;s a perfectly valid argument and one that also protects one of South Africa&#8217;s most prized talents from having too put on his young shoulders.
