Sindy Mabe, the ANN7 primetime news anchor, probably regrets responding to Tom Eaton&#8217;s Twitter post in which the well-known satirist exclaimed that a &#8220;corrupt party calls on corrupt government to investigate allegations of corruption against itself&#8221;. He sarcastically proclaimed the matter closed: &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s all sorted then.&#8221; eNCA spat about ANC calling government to urgently investigate allegations contained in #GuptaEmails #GuptaLeaks eNCA tweet ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe had earlier said the party must do so because allegations contained in #GuptaEmails and #GuptaLeaks were serious and failure to do so would erode government&#8217;s credibility. ANN7&#8217;s newsreader was ticked off with Eaton. &#8220;Your comments fit well with the incessant desire and public lexicon to dislodge the ANC. We see you.&#8221; Eaton wasted no time responding to Mabe&#8217;s statement. The clapback was so spicy, Mabe has since gone underground on the issue. &#8220;Day made: Gupta TV&#8217;s shill tries the old &#8216;we see you&#8217; routine when I suggest &#8211; gasp! &#8211; that the ruling cabal is utterly corrupt. &#8220;I&#8217;m intrigued by the &#8216;we&#8217;: who do you think they are? A committee of bought PR spokesmuppets pretending to be journalists? A coterie of toadies who spend their days with their lips pressed to Gupta buttocks? Or just her and her imaginary friend?&#8221; he asked. Another Twitter user, Fiona Parkinson, poured petrol on the fire with this over-the-top post: &#8220;They see you seeing them, and it makes them twitchy. Very twitchy, like a cartoon-guy-touching-an-electric-fence-and-you-can-see-his-white-skeleton-in-the-black-body kind of twitchy.&#8221; Another spectator, Delme Cupido, on the other hand, simply wanted to know what &#8216;public lexicon&#8217; meant. Eaton was not yet done with raking the media house&#8217;s employee through the coals. &#8220;Sindy doesn&#8217;t seem to realize that a less pretentious way of saying &#8216;public lexicon&#8217; is &#8216;everyone is talking about&#8217; removing the ANC. Because, well, duh,&#8221; he explained. WATCH: ANN7 reporter upset after EFF marchers pour water on her For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
