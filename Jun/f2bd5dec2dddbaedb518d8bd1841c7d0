Award-winning rapper David Junior Ngcobo, better known by his stage name Nasty C, has been on the Twitter trends list for dividing opinion with his comment that he has never personally experienced racism in South Africa. The young rapper was speaking in an interview with Sway In the Morning, a US radio show, in which he also got people talking after a freestyle rap performance on Thursday. Nasty C is in America for the BET Awards and was invited to Sway&#8217;s studios in New York for an interview and freestyle session. Nasty C&#8217;s freestyle rap left Sway almost lost for words and Sway ended up on his feet screaming along with some of his favourite lines from the freestyle. Take a look at a clip of the freestyle, with another video of the complete interview below: It wasn&#8217;t just his rap virtuosity that caught people&#8217;s attention, though, but a comment from Nasty C that he&#8217;s never experienced racism in South Africa. Have a look at some of the reactions to this below: Did Nasty C say that he hasn&#39;t experienced racism or that it doesn&#39;t exist? Because those 2 statements are completely different. &mdash; Travis Thott (@ThatoR_) June 23, 2017 Nasty C to experiencing racism is SA pic.twitter.com/s7azRSfazy &mdash; Michael (@Mykie_myk) June 24, 2017 Can&#39;t believe an American educated Nasty C about racism on Sway in the morning but what did we expect Nasty C grew up eating ka folk &amp; knife pic.twitter.com/5g0zxVcxTb &mdash; Family Tree (@BoyzieMzamo) June 23, 2017 How can Nasty C say he&#39;s never experienced racism when he comes from South Africa wow pic.twitter.com/Xi2dKq0co6 &mdash; Nosi (@Nosipho___) June 23, 2017 Nasty C didn&#39;t say there is no racism in South Africa, he said he has never experienced it.
