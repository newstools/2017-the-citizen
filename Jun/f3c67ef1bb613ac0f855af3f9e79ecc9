Assassinated millionaire North West businessperson Wandile Bozwana had desperately tried to save his lover s life when assailants opened fire on them, the High Court in Pretoria has heard. Bozwana died and his lover Mpho Baloyi was seriously injured in an ambush on the Garsfontein off-ramp of the N1 highway in the east of Pretoria in October 2015. A former business associate of Bozwana, Midrand businessman Vusi Mathibela, as well as Sipho Hudla, Robert Mutapa and Paul Khumalo, have pleaded not guilty to murdering Bozwana and attempting to murder Baloyi. Baloyi testified that she and Bozwana had been lovers since 2013. They had spent the evening before the incident together and the next morning went to Sandton City and from there to a hairdresser and a fast-food restaurant. She saw a silver BMW approaching on the Garsfontein offramp. One of the passenger doors opened and she heard sounds and something hitting her car. Despite being wounded, Baloyi managed to drive to a nearby business, where the police and an ambulance were contacted. Baloyi said she had met Mathibela for the first time at a Centurion restaurant at the end of 2014. Counsel for Mathibela said his client admitted meeting Bozwana and another associate on many occasions at the restaurant.
