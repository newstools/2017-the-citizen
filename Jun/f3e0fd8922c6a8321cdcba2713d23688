Quite understandably, Springboks coach Allister Coetzee kept his changes to the absolute minimum for Saturday&#8217;s second Test against France at Kings Park in Durban. In fact, the only shuffle in the entire group of 23 is a forced one. Also read: All the Lions deserve to be Springboks, says Franco Smith Lions star Lionel Mapoe, who was recovering from a niggle last week, has been drafted into the starting line-up at outside centre. He replaces Jesse Kriel, who sustained concussion at Loftus. There had been a small debate over whether there was a case to be made for the experienced Frans Steyn to slot in at inside centre. But that would&#8217;ve meant Jan Serfontein shifting to the No 13 jersey. Given how well the Bulls midfielder eventually performed in Pretoria last week, Coetzee was reluctant. &#8220;Jan Serfontein had a very good match at inside centre and we wanted a specialist outside him as replacement for Jesse,&#8221; said the Springboks mentor. &#8220;Lionel is a logical choice. It also means we ve prevented making two changes to the team.&#8221; Continuity is the buzzword in the camp as team management want &#8220;important combinations&#8221; to &#8220;keep gaining experience&#8221;. The forwards in particular will be keen to impose themselves further after an encouraging previous showing. &#8220;The forward battle will always be a very important part of the game,&#8221; said Coetzee. &#8220;We know we will be up against a very well prepared French team in the second Test and we are readying ourselves for that. They would like to bounce back and we would like to continue with our processes. Both teams have a lot to too play for.&#8221; Springboks: Andries Coetzee, Raymond Rhule, Lionel Mapoe, Jan Serfontein, Courtnall Skosan, Elton Jantjies, Ross Cronje, Warren Whiteley (c), Oupa Mohoje, Siya Kolisi, Franco Mostert, Eben Etzebeth, Frans Malherbe, Malcolm Marx, Beast Mtawarira.
