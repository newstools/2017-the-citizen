Lebowakgomo Magistrates Court, operating in the Thabamoopo district, on Friday postponed the bail application of EFF leader Julius Malema s lawyer, advocate Tumi Mokoena. Mokoena faces four counts of attempted murder after he allegedly shot four farmworkers at Zebediela Citrus Farm outside Polokwane on Thursday. The magistrate granted the prosecution the postponement so that a detailed profile on Mokwena could be obtained. It is alleged that when Mokoena attempted to visit the farm to represent five workers who had salary disputes with its management, a group of angry farmworkers confronted him armed with sticks and stones, and demanded that he leave the property. The group accused Mokoena of failing to pay workers while he was part of the farm s management last year. When workers allegedly blocked his way when he tried to leave, Mokoena allegedly shot at them and injured four employees, with one of the workers sustaining a serious gunshot wound. His bail application is expected to begin on Tuesday, June 27. ALSO READ: Malema s lawyer to appear in court after allegedly shooting farmworkers &nbsp;
