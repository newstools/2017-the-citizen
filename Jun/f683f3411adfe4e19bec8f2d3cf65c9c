AB de Villiers continually says he has a burning desire to win 2019&#8217;s World Cup in England. But his first golden duck in 212 ODI innings against Pakistan on Wednesday was the latest example that all is not well with the Proteas one-day skipper. And the evidence has been there for some time now. March 2015: The World Cup semi debacle De Villiers allegedly threatens to withdraw from the semifinal against New Zealand in Auckland after the national selectors are ordered by Cricket South Africa (CSA) chief executive Haroon Lorgat to pick between Vernon Philander and Kyle Abbott. Initial reports stated an SMS at 01:00 NZ time &#8211; 13 hours before the game &#8211; informed the Proteas of the executive order. Yet in his autobiography, De Villiers writes he had already known by 17:30 the previous day. He admitted he was &#8220;emotional&#8221; over the situation. &#8220;It depressed me to think of my team-mates in these outdated racial terms,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;Would anyone really mind if there were three or four players of colour in our side?&#8221; December 2015: Rumours of retirement Following a 3-0 hammering in the Test series against India, the Proteas are under pressure to get off to a good start against England. Instead, a report says De Villiers is contemplating retirement due to the dramas earlier in the year. The Proteas stalwart does little to provide comfort and a talks about having to &#8220;take a rest here and there&#8221;. But there&#8217;s also a theory that De Villiers is still disappointed at not having been named Graeme Smith&#8217;s successor in Tests mid-2014. Interestingly, Hashim Amla &#8211; the incumbent &#8211; resigns from the Test captaincy in the next Test, handing the reigns to De Villiers. Rumours persist that he milked the unconfirmed reports to get the job. However, his four scores thereafter are 36,0,0 and 0. August 2016: The culture camp Enough is enough for Proteas coach Russell Domingo, who&#8217;s under massive pressure after a poor season. He gathers 30 of the leading players in the country for a weekend in Randpark Ridge, where all involved re-asses what it means to play for South Africa. The exercise proves immensely valuable and De Villiers says &#8220;it&#8217;s the most useful forum we&#8217;ve had in years&#8221;. All involved commit to the national team&#8217;s cause and there&#8217;s a new sense of team spirit. De Villiers though is stuck on the sidelines with an elbow injury for at least six months. December 2016: Fantastic Faf Faf du Plessis proves a hit as the Proteas&#8217; new captain and notably wins the Test series in Australia. With De Villiers still not ready to play in the Tests against Sri Lanka, he &#8211; in a move worthy of praise &#8211; decides to hand his Test captaincy to his good mate. &#8220;The interests of the team must always outweigh the interests of any individual, including me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It is clearly in the greater interests of the team that Faf du Plessis should be confirmed as the permanent Test captain.&#8221; January 2017: The Test(ing) question De Villiers reveals he&#8217;s not making himself available for the Test series against New Zealand and England because he wants to concentrate on keeping himself fit for the World Cup. Everybody thinks that amounts to retirement in that format of the game. Also read: AB de Villiers apologises for not being clearer on Test future Yet De Villiers apologises for &#8220;being unclear&#8221; and says he &#8220;plans&#8221; to make a comeback next season against India and Australia. &#8220;I m not committing to those series, it s merely my plan.&#8221; No-one knows what that really means. April 2017: The IPL pep talk De Villiers candidly reveals how he needed an intimate chat with his wife Danielle to help with calming &#8221; self-doubts&#8221; that crept up. It makes for a nice story but it&#8217;s also weird for a man who played a starring role in the Proteas&#8217; ODI series against New Zealand the previous month. Also read: IPL thanks AB de Villiers wife for her pep talk &#8220;I phoned my wife just before the game telling her that I am doubting myself a bit but I surprised myself and played a few good shots,&#8221; he said. June 2017: Questions abound Two innings in the ICC Champions Trophy and two scores of 4 and 0. Critics say he&#8217;s again underperforming when stakes are at its highest and worse, his dismissals &#8211; an early pull-shot and a rash slap to point &#8211; suggest a man who&#8217;s unfocused. He&#8217;s not quite his friendly self in media conferences and reacts relatively badly to suggestions of ball-tampering against England.
