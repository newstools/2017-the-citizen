Electricity parastatal Eskom on Saturday night dismissed social media messages on load shedding as false and mischievous . Eskom wishes to warn members of the public that messages doing the rounds on social media about load shedding being scheduled for six hours from tomorrow morning (Sunday, 18 June) are baseless, false, and mischievous, it said in a statement. Eskom operates a stable power system with a surplus capacity of between 3000MW and 4000MW on a daily basis. Eskom has not implemented any load shedding for the past 22 months and we plan to continue along this trajectory going forward, Eskom said.
