The hashtag #ThingsThatLedUsIntoARecession has been trending on Twitter following the news that South Africa&#8217;s GDP contracted by 7% in the first quarter of the year. South Africa s first quarter gross domestic product figures released on Tuesday were described by economists as worse than expected and confirmed that the country had entered a recession for the first time in nine years. Twitter peeps have tried to find the lighter side by listing all the things they suspect may have led to this latest crisis in South Africa. Unsurprisingly, there was a lot of bashing of the Jacob Zuma government, parastatals and a certain family from India. #ThingsThatLedUsIntoARecession unnecessary dances by our ministers &#8230; pic.twitter.com/cWtsnMQUgD &mdash; FitGuru (@ItsBonkosi) June 6, 2017 #ThingsThatLedUsIntoARecession This man&#39;s greed led us into recession . pic.twitter.com/wCLsGS0g4i &mdash; Omphile (@Lyroy_RSA) June 6, 2017 #ThingsThatLedUsIntoARecession JacobZuma inspired #FirePools pic.twitter.com/yUY6ofMKAx &mdash; Khan Sifile (@KhanSifile) June 6, 2017 #ThingsThatLedUsIntoARecession the amount of material used on this suit! pic.twitter.com/GkynrOeS8U &mdash; TEBOGO (@FIGHTER_TEBZER) June 6, 2017 #ThingsThatLedUsIntoARecession C.L.I.T is requested pic.twitter.com/h4fXx1OTkM &mdash; Lab Rat (@vincent_kolobe) June 6, 2017 #ThingsThatLedUsIntoARecession Paying TV License Only To Struggle With The Ariel pic.twitter.com/tti1K03j8i &mdash; Vinatorvill Ext 98 (@pontshoseaba) June 6, 2017 #ThingsThatLedUsIntoARecession This guy and his associates pic.twitter.com/3kd0hGemPp &mdash; MALOME T (@sharepart) June 6, 2017 #ThingsThatLedUsIntoARecession We were given all the tools to succeed but we too dumb to use them pic.twitter.com/HvDHbrxi2Q &mdash; L U T H O (@Lutho__m) June 6, 2017 Saving water and drinking beer #ThingsThatLedUsIntoARecession pic.twitter.com/QeLcbBBIY2 &mdash; Apple_Pie (@Ms_Phumzi) June 6, 2017 #ThingsThatLedUsIntoARecession Tax payers money missing, yet the leaders keep getting richer pic.twitter.com/E5ZNvDyjwd &mdash; TANGI (@18opson) June 6, 2017 Sandton&#39;s CONSTANT construction #ThingsThatLedUsIntoARecession pic.twitter.com/JSI6mKWWaw &mdash; Apple_Pie (@Ms_Phumzi) June 6, 2017 #ThingsThatLedUsIntoARecession The partners in crime of the #StateCapture. #Recession pic.twitter.com/OsYRgzKp11 &mdash; Sundowns_Fanatic (@Solomon_Madube) June 6, 2017 #ThingsThatLedUsIntoARecession I think Zuma built this one pic.twitter.com/YN0p0r0l5H &mdash; Simon (@tp_sithole) June 6, 2017 &nbsp;
