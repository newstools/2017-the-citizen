Early in the first half of last week&#8217;s Test against France, the Springboks conceded a free kick from a scrum. Beast Mtawarira was clearly annoyed with referee Ben O&#8217;Keefe and even had a few words. It was a bit out of character for the veteran prop, who is usually a quietly spoken and reserved man. But Matt Proudfoot, the Springboks&#8217; scrum guru, believes that&#8217;s hardly a bad thing. In fact, it&#8217;s a sign of the 31-year-old&#8217;s continued passion for international rugby. Also read: Allister Coetzee: I have no critics, only God can judge me &#8220;These guys (the front row) are giving to each other,&#8221; said Proudfoot on Tuesday. &#8220;They&#8217;re investing in a platform, meaning the scrum. They take pride in it. When they gain success or a call goes against them, they will react. I&#8217;m pleased when I see things like that. I&#8217;m glad we have dynamic personalities who are driving the system.&#8221; In Mtawarira&#8217;s case, seeing him react so noticeably is vital. There are quarters of the local rugby fraternity that are questioning his ability. And there&#8217;s probably some truth to it. Mtawarira hasn&#8217;t been in poor form but he has been tailing off steadily over the past few years. Perhaps that&#8217;s because people expect the Zimbabwean-born powerhouse to still be running around like a speeding bulldozer. Yet Proudfoot insists questioning Mtawarira&#8217;s suitability for the Springboks testifies to a lack of understanding about what prop play really entails. &#8220;To say a guy with 90 caps is past it is, in my opinion, absolutely crazy,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Beast&#8217;s influence has been incredible. Talk to any of the props in the national system and they&#8217;ll tell you he&#8217;s been great. There&#8217;s an appetite from the props to be successful as a collective. Beast has helped the others to engage with each other, to share ideas and give advice.&#8221; In the Springboks camp, scrumming is &#8211; to an extent &#8211; referred to as a &#8220;dark art&#8221;. It&#8217;s an aspect of the game where the smallest of technicalities and split second decision-making can have a massive influence. To be honest, it explains why the normal observer (and some say referees) don&#8217;t fully understand scrum law. International front rowers, though, do and that&#8217;s why Mtawarira remains so relevant. &#8220;When you talk about mastering the &#8216;dark arts&#8217;, it comes with experience,&#8221; said Proudfoot. &#8220;A guy like Beast just has so much knowledge. He&#8217;s been there and he&#8217;s done that. Scrumming is not a natural position for the body to be in. It&#8217;s about manufacturing a position to shove a unit forward. Beast has mastered that and he&#8217;s transferring that knowledge to others.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter. Would you like to place a rugby bet?
