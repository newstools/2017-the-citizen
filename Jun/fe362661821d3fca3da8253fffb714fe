Eskom board chairman Ben Ngubane has resigned from his post, Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown announced late on Monday night. Dr Ngubane formally tendered his resignation, which I accepted, Brown said in a statement. Ngubane was a firm supporter of disgraced former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe. I would like to thank Dr Ngubane for his contribution to turning Eskom around since the load shedding days of 2014/15, and wish him well in the future. Brown appointed Zethembe Khoza as the interim board chairman until I am able to take new board appointments to Cabinet for approval . African News Agency (ANA)
