Dar es Salaam. The dynamics in the music industry is rather unpredictable and sometimes the same reason why a certain artiste is successful could be the same token that fails another. At the end of the day the creative and marketing skills of a particular team will see the light of day as they exploit the soft spots of the industry.Seven days ago, some coincidence struck when four songs were released on the same day and posted on Youtube, it became some debate on just who would out do the other in the war of views within the first week.The artistes at the centre of the story were WCB s Harmonize, Baraka Da Prince, Jay Moe and Prof Jay in what seemed to have been a battle between hip hop and Bongo Flava.The releases went on to confirm Bongo Flava s competitiveness in the region in compared to neighbours Uganda and Kenya who were once on top of the game.By Thursday morning Niambie by Hermonise had generated over 900,000 views, a number that beat the other three combined.On that day Acha Niende by Baraka had gained some 370,000, Professor Jay s Kibabe was following close with 250,000 whereas Jay Moe s Nisaidie Kushare closing with 152,000.These songs according to records on Youtube gained momentum on the second night of their release with Harmonise scoring some 200,000 viewers before stablising at an average of 100,000 per day. Though some local directors worked on the videos, of the four, only Prof Jay s Kibabe was shot in Tanzania, Harmonise and Jay Moe opted for what now seems every Tanzanian musician s play ground, South Africa whereas Baraka crossed the border to work with Kevin Bosco Jr in Nairobi. By all standards they are all good songs with great picture quality to match the story line and taste of today s versatile viewers.These numbers tell a story of its kind that no one can afford to ignore in an industry that is as competitive as Bongo Flava for the commercial success of music today depends on numbers.This was Professor Jay s was Prof Jay s return after his attempt at Singeli genre with Sholo Mwamba sometime last year and likewise it was Jay Moe s second attempt after his return to music after a long layoff that almost wrote off his career. New crop versus old guardThe success of the two young artistes Baraka and Harmonise underlined just how far the pioneers are lagging behind the new artistes.It is quite clear that times in the industry have changed so has the marketing dynamics of the industry which now requires more than just the ordinary art.Whereas there is a feeling that some of these guys are the pioneers of the industry, today s average viewer is young and connected as opposed to a music fan of some 15 years ago.To the cynical, these might be a crop that is glued to trivial issues that Harmonize and Baraka bring on the table as opposed to the heavy lyrical content that Prof Jay raps about.But such is our world, how else can anyone explain the success that Darasa got with his Muziki which was lyrically empty by all means and disjointed in the narrative. PromotionAs agreed by most, to be a talented artiste is one thing and to be a commercially successful one is a different ball game altogether.Nisaidie Kushare is a shot in the foot as it attacks the very avenue that today s musician use to market their craft and it is no wonder that it score dismally.This is not an era where music is marketed by the amount of air play on a radio and television, the social media today is a promotional tool that artistes use for all the different purposes.Baraka and Harmonize as a representation of true modern artistes of today are signed on two lebels Rockstar4000 and WCB respectively. So what?As compared to their older compatriots who have to do it all by themselves, their deals allows them to concentrate of the creative side of the business whereas the marketing and promotional sides are taken care of by the label.Promotion as an important element in music has been an area that WCB has mastered so well in the industry and has worked in their favour and in the process driving views on different platforms.These labels organise for launches, radio tours and much more all these guarantee success for the artiste as compared to solo efforts of yesteryears. A management team that is headed by Seven at Rockstar4000 has a way that it operates that guarantees success no wonder big names like AliKiba and Lady Jaydee all had to sign.Romance sellsBoth Harmonise and Baraka dwell on the Bongo Flava staple which is romance and it proved once again that it sells.Early this year there were rumours that Harmonise and his celebrity girlfriend Jacqueline Wolper had gone separate ways.To many s surprise on the day of the release of this song Harmonise was accompanied on a radio tour by Jacqueline who features in the video as the singer s spouse. Whether the breakup was a media stunt, it has worked miracles in Harmonise commercial favour in a follow up.It was not just some other ordinary story, but one that was dressed with elements of reality and controversy that surrounds the artiste s life. Hip hop versus Bongo FlavaThis might be a bitter pill but one that has to be swallowed. Last year during the Tigo Fiesta festival there was every sign that Hip Hop artistes had outdone their compatriots.This is a debate that is yet to get a true winners and one that will perhaps take a real contest before the winners is announced. The battle for supremacy remains hot as Prof Jay takes a thinly veiled dig at AliKiba saying Tell your king to wipe of the dust off my throne, in Kibabe .Even as they command great audiences at shows, those who deal with sales will tell you that Bongo Flava does well at the market place compared to hip hop. And the debate goes on until then when the winner will be found. The quadruple release of these songs could have been some coincidence but one that brought to light just what the reality might be as opposed to what we are constantly told.
