&#8220;FC Barcelona expresses its surprise and indignation at the decision by the FIFA Disciplinary Committee to suspend Leo Messi following the FIFA World Cup qualifying fixture between Argentina and Chile,&#8221; Barca said in a statement. &#8220;The club considers the four-match suspension imposed on the Argentine player to be unfair and totally disproportionate. &#8220;Finally, FC Barcelona wishes to reiterate its support for Leo Messi, an exemplary player in terms of conduct, both on and off the pitch.&#8221; FIFA suspended Messi for four of Argentina&#8217;s five remaining World Cup qualification matches after he was caught swearing at an official in the victory over Chile last week. Spain&#8217;s La Liga president Javier Tebas told a press conference in Madrid on Wednesday he felt the sanction was heavy-handed. &#8220;You have to put it into context, in an important World Cup qualifier a player can get overheated,&#8221; Tebas said, although admitting he was unaware of what Messi had said to the official. &#8220;It seems exaggerated to me, a one match ban or a heavy fine would have been more appropriate,&#8221; he suggested. The FIFA announcement fell just hours before Messi was due to captain Argentina against Bolivia late Tuesday. Argentina went on to lose 2-0 to the Bolivians to deal a fresh blow to their 2018 World Cup qualification campaign. Messi will also miss Argentina&#8217;s qualifiers in Uruguay on August 31, at home to Venezuela on September 5 and against Peru on October 5.
