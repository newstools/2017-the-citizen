The driver of a minibus taxi died when he lost control of his vehicle and crashed into a house in Imbali Unit J, close to Edendale in Pietermaritzburg on Saturday, KwaZulu-Natal paramedics said. It was believed that the brakes on the 52-year-old man s minibus could have failed when he crashed through a wall and then into one of the rooms of the house around noon, ER24 spokeswoman Annine Dormehl said. Fortunately no one was in the room at the time and no one else sustained injuries as there were no passengers in the taxi. At the time of their arrival ER24 paramedics found members of the community trying to push the taxi out of the house. This is when paramedics discovered the driver had been killed. Nothing could be done to save his life and he was declared dead on the scene. The local fire department and police were at the scene. It was believed that it might take a few hours for the taxi to be removed from the house as more walls could collapse, Dormehl said. . . .
