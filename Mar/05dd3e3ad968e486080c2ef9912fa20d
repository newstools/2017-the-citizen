Makes 5 pizza cones EASY 40 mins + 45 mins, to prove THE FLAVOUR COMBINATIONS 200g cake flour 125ml ( cup) warm water 5ml (1 tsp) instant dry yeast 7,5ml (1 tsp) sugar pinch salt tomato paste, to brush 300g mozzarella, grated 10 slices prosciutto olive oil, to drizzle salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste fresh basil leaves, to garnish &nbsp; HOW TO DO IT 1. For the pizza dough, combine the flour, water, yeast, sugar and salt in a medium bowl. Bring together to form a soft dough, turn out onto a floured surface and knead until the dough is smooth and elastic, 3 minutes. Transfer to an oiled bowl and set aside in a warm place to prove, 45 minutes. 2. Preheat the oven to 220 C. Grease five metal cones, or put foil around five ice-cream cones. Roll out the dough on a floured surface into a rectangle the dough should be 1cm thick. Cut into five strips and wrap around the cones, starting at the base of the cones and pinching the dough together to secure. Place the cones on a greased baking tray and bake in the oven until cooked through and golden, about 30 minutes. Remove from oven, but leave the oven on. 3 Allow the cones to cool a little, and remove the metal- or foil-wrapped cones from the dough cones. Arrange the cones in ovenproof jars on a baking tray (to keep them upright). Brush the insides of the cones with tomato paste, then fill with grated cheese and prosciutto, before drizzling with olive oil and seasoning well to taste. Bake in the preheated oven for a further 20 minutes or until the cheese is melted and bubbling. Serve garnished with fresh basil leaves.
