Structural fire at warehouse in industrial area Jacobs, Durban @EMERGCONTROL #DurbanFire pic.twitter.com/uVIodzfunQ Arrive Alive (@_ArriveAlive) March 24, 2017 The fire broke out in the morning at a Transnet wax production facility, south of Durban on Friday and continues to rage as firefighters attempt to keep it under control. Chief Fire Commander at eThekwini Municipality, Enoch Mchunu, says petrol stations around the area had to close because of the highly flammable and explosive chemicals and fertiliser being stored in an undamaged section of the warehouse, Jacaranda FM reports. According to Alex Gloster , a Durban Fire Department commander who spoke to Times LIVE, the fire was the biggest he had ever seen. There is no risk to residents who live in surrounding areas who have had to contend with a thick blanket of dark smoke filling the sky. Two major freeways were shut down yesterday as the fire affected visibility on the roads.
