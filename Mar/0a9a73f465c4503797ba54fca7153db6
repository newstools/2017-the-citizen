For the past three weeks, it&#8217;s been all about Kagiso Rabada and the Proteas&#8217; potent, new-look bowling attack. But when the first of three Tests between South Africa and New Zealand begins on Wednesday in Dunedin, there&#8217;ll be a distinct throwback to the past. Also read: Kagiso Rabada isn&#8217;t a leader, rather a valued team-man Vernon Philander and Morne Morkel are both expected to be included and keen to prove that the &#8220;old dogs&#8221; still have a bite. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad Vernon is on my side and I don&#8217;t have to face him when this game starts,&#8221; said Proteas opener Dean Elgar on Monday. &#8220;We&#8217;re blessed to have him in our side. He&#8217;s a key member. A fired-up Morne Morkel is also a guy I&#8217;m more than happy just to face in the nets. I&#8217;d rather take those 7 minutes of hell than play against him in a Test!&#8221; The experienced pair were instrumental in the Proteas&#8217; series win on their last tour, scalping a combined 31 victims. Together, they have taken a staggering 401 Test wickets between them. On what Elgar describes as a &#8220;juicy&#8221; pitch at the University Oval, it&#8217;s probably Philander who might have the biggest say on proceedings. &#8220;His lengths will be suited to New Zealand conditions,&#8221; said Elgar. &#8220;The overhead conditions will also assist him with his seam movement but it&#8217;s still going to be important to adapt quickly. You can&#8217;t assume everything is in your favour.&#8221; Morkel&#8217;s selection is a bit more complicated because he faces stiff competition from rookie Duanne Olivier, who took 5 wickets on Test debut in January and was the leading wicket-taker in the domestic four-day competition. The lanky quick hasn&#8217;t played Test cricket since late January 2016 and has been plagued by a back injury. &#8220;I think Morne is really hungry,&#8221; said Elgar. &#8220;During the last five months he&#8217;s had a lot of time to think about his game, do his rehab en get fit. As a left-hander, I think Morne will be more difficult to face in these conditions. &#8220;But it&#8217;s not a clear-cut thing. Duanne&#8217;s had a brilliant domestic season.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
