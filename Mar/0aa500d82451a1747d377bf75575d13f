An ultra-conservative Russian lawmaker on Saturday urged the culture ministry to check Disney&#8217;s upcoming film &#8220;Beauty and the Beast&#8221; for possible breaches of a law banning &#8220;gay propaganda&#8221;. In a letter to Culture Minister Vladimir Medinsky seen by RIA Novosti state news agency, MP Vitaly Milonov called the film &#8220;blatant, shameless propaganda of sin and perverted sexual relationships.&#8221; Bill Condon, the director of the film due for release in Russia on March 16, has revealed that it will contain Disney&#8217;s &#8220;first exclusively gay moment&#8221;, although some critics have said it is less than overwhelming. Milonov urged the culture minister to hold a special screening of the film ahead of the premiere and to &#8220;take measures to totally ban the showing of this film&#8221; if he found &#8220;elements of propaganda of homosexuality&#8221;. The Walt Disney Company Russia &amp; CIS did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Milonov became a member of the national parliament for the ruling United Russia party last year after serving as a regional lawmaker in his home city of Saint Petersburg. He became notorious as one of the chief instigators of Russia&#8217;s law banning &#8220;gay propaganda&#8221;, signed by President Vladimir Putin in 2013. The law which prompted international condemnation bans distribution of information that could interest those under age 18 in &#8220;non-traditional sexual relationships.&#8221; It has been used as a pretext to ban gay pride events. With ultra-conservative views on morality, Milonov has attacked everything from Facebook to the Eurovision Song Contest and called for the creation of a morality police to fine people who violate &#8220;traditional values&#8221;. Russia decriminalised homosexuality in 1993 and only in 1999 lifted its classification as a mental illnesses.
