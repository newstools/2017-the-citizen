Not one to shy away from a political debate or share his views on burning topics, AKA began tweeting about the Cabinet reshuffle that happened last night. Ten ministers and deputies were axed from President Jacob Zuma&#8217;s Cabinet, with Pravin Gordhan and his deputy, Mcebisi Jonas, being given the boot from the finance ministry. AKA has always been vocal about being an ANC supporter and has often performed at rallies for the ruling party. Today he was locked in a debate with his Twitter fans after he began tweeting about how Zuma had given the power back to the youth by appointing Malusi Gigaba to the finance ministry. The youth of this country now run the finance, energy, transport, police and ICT. JZ has given our generation the greatest gift &mdash; AKA (@akaworldwide) March 31, 2017 #cabinetreshuffle has put young leaders in serious positions now! Btw ,young is someone in their 40&#39;s. This is politics, not Bafana Bafana. &mdash; AKA (@akaworldwide) March 31, 2017 This prompted people to ask him if he really understood what being a youth was and if he had contributed to the youth of this country in any way besides selling his music. I currently employ 15 young people, pay them salaries, issue them pay slips to buy houses and cars. What are you doing to help?? https://t.co/spJWIN0EA8 &mdash; AKA (@akaworldwide) March 31, 2017 AKA also stirred some controversy by saying that he would support the Guptas and Zuma anytime over the Oppenheimer family, who are one of SA&#8217;s wealthiest families. I&#39;ll take a Gupta &amp; a Zuma over a Zille &amp; an Oppenheimer &#8230;&#8230; ANYDAY &mdash; AKA (@akaworldwide) March 31, 2017 He also took on Gordhan, saying he was practically a puppet for white monopoly. Pravin Gordhan was good for the economy &amp; its white monopoly capital &#8230;. Your Oppenheimers. Your masters of mankind. &mdash; AKA (@akaworldwide) March 31, 2017 Junk status this junk status that &#8230;.. Tsek!!!! Leave us with your neo colonial tools developed to make us feel worse about ourselves! &mdash; AKA (@akaworldwide) March 31, 2017 ALSO READ: Unathi Msengana leaves Metro FM For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
