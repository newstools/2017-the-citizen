Struggle veteran and Rivonia trialist Ahmed Kathrada s condition has deteriorated over the past 24 hours and he has contracted pneumonia, the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation said on Monday. According to the foundation&#8217;s director Neeshan Balton, his condition has worsened after he experienced several post-operation complications, rendering his condition serious . The 87-year-old was hospitalised in Johannesburg earlier this month for surgery related to blood clotting on the brain. Balton said the pneumonia Kathrada contracted had affected both his lungs. Despite appropriate medical care, his condition is deteriorating. He is currently comfortable. The Kathrada Foundation will keep the public informed on a regular basis about Kathrada s condition. Follow our Twitter handle @KathradaFound for updates, Balton added. Balton also asked members of the public to keep the stalwart and his family in their prayers during this period. Additionally, well-wishers can post their messages of support on the Foundation s Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/KathradaFound/), or by emailing info@kathradafoundation.org. We have also had requests from people about where they can leave cards bearing messages of support, or flowers. This can be dropped off at the Foundation s offices (Signet Terrace Office Park, Block B, Suite 2 &#8211; 19 Guinea-Fowl Street, Ext 1, Lenasia). All of the messages that we have received will be collated and passed on to the family, Balton explained. Kathrada, a tireless activist for non-racialism and Constitutionalism, is one of three Rivonia Trialists still alive today; the other two being Andrew Mlangeni and Denis Goldberg.
