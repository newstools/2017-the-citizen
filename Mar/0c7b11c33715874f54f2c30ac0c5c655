Dar es Salaam. Following months of near-silence, the opposition has found itself in the spotlight again with the defection of former Miss Tanzania Wema Sepetu from the ruling CCM to Chadema.The actress, who has been in the media for weeks now over her alleged involvement in drugs, was a key part of the team of local celebrities who bolstered the ruling party s presidential campaign in 2015.Her jumping ship, announced at a press conference in Dar es Salaam last week, attracted much attention from various quarters.And as the media and political analysts enjoyed a field day over the latest political development, the actress multitude of followers on social media were, apparently, divided on whether or not the former beauty queen had made a smart move.There are some who have gone to the extent of doubting her sincerity considering that she openly revealed that her defection had by and large everything to do with the humiliation she suffered at the hands of Dar es Salaam Regional Commissioner Paul Makonda whose anti-drugs crusade has attracted as much praise as it has ignited a political fire in and outside government.However, Ms Sepetu was also quick to point out that she wanted to join the opposition to fight for freedom and democracy .Yet the question that remains unanswered is how significant Wema Sepetu can be in the opposition, seeing how Chadema s top brass have rushed to embrace her.The public appearance of the socialite actress in the company of Chadema national chairman Freeman Mbowe only served to fuel the already rife speculation that the party may actually be having serious plans for her.Just before the announcement of her surprise move, Ms Sepetu was pictured sitting next to Mr Mbowe and Chadema s Bunda Urban MP Esther Bulaya in court last week during the mentioning of the opposition leader s case.She had also received the legal services of Mr Tundu Lissu, director of the party s legal department.And a few days after she moved to Chadema, she appeared with senior opposition leaders, including Mr Mbowe and former Prime Minister-turned-opposition leader Edward Lowassa, at the National Stadium in Dar es Salaam during the Simba-Yanga match last Saturday.There is speculation that she has been lined up for a special seats appointment in the National Assembly, on a Chadema ticket. Previously, there had been reports that her dalliance with CCM was also a bid for the same seat in Parliament.Ms Wema herself has openly spoken about her political ambitions when she attempted to vie for the women special parliamentary seat on a ruling party ticket in 2015. And at a press conference attended by Kinondoni Mayor Boniphace Jacob at her Sinza home, she said she would now be fighting for freedom and democracy from the opposition side.Political analysts also seem to be divided over the significance real or perceived of Ms Wema s role in the opposition.Prof Kitila Mkumbo of the University of Dar es Salaam (UDSM) suggests that the attention and publicity that Ms Sepetu has had over her defection has everything to do with timing Chadema is facing a difficult moment in the midst of its long-running battles with the fifth phase government.But he is quick to point out that while the actress could be a shot in the arm for the country s main opposition party, Chadema should not fall into the trap of reading too much into this. Why wasn t David Kafulila given such attention when he defected to Chadema from NCCR-Mageuzi? You can t compare Ms Sepetu and Mr Kafulila; he is an active politician, free of scandals. He has undoubtedly contributed to country s politics. Why was he welcomed so quietly? he questions.But others believe that the opposition has grabbed an opportunity and could use it to its advantage at a time it faces an unprecedented threat of sinking into oblivion.Game of numbersIn an interview with The Citizen s sister paper Mwananchi this week, Mr Hamad Salim, a political science lecturer at the Open University of Tanzania (OUT), said by embracing the former beauty queen, Chadema could have scored one against CCM. She is an artiste with a significant number of followers; their support and backing from fellow artistes will determine the full impact of her defection, he said.Last week, Ms Wema, who has no substantial political experience, also made reference to what many believe is the only thing she is bringing to the opposition table her followers.She told reporters that she believed her followers 2.6 million on Instagram, 280,000 on Twitter and over 5,000 on Facebook, would support her. Posterity will judge how that pans out.Celebrities sellMr Hamad said most political parties across the world use celebrities simply because celebrities sell. They use their high-profile to encourage people, world organisations and politicians to support their cause. This could be the case with the Sepetu case, he explained.Various studies conclude that celebrity endorsements can be a major political asset depending on a number of things, including the credibility of the persons involved.In modern politics, celebrities help politicians to engage with a younger generation of voters, or provide means to rebrand politicians or political parties. Overwhelmingly though, scholars agree that celebrity involvement in political activities helps to promote civic engagement.Political analysts also believe that celebrity endorsements make it easier for citizens to distinguish among candidates during an election, in that they see celebrities they like, admire, or relate to and use this association to make a choice among candidates.In other words, a significant of citizens, or voters, have a tendency to rely on information gathered from their non-political lives to make political choices easier.This explains the rush by political parties to get singers, musicians, actors and even religious leaders on board, especially towards an election period.University of Dar es Salaam political science lecturer Richard Mbunda agrees.And he explains that the fact that Ms Sepetu s supporters are mainly the youth, who forms the huge chunk of voters in the country, is worth considering. Her importance was evident during the 2015 General Election when she campaigned with the-now Vice President, Ms Samia Suluhu Hassan. People may not see the impact of her decision now, but they will in the future, he says.Chadema itself seems bent on taking advantage of political endorsements by local celebrities a significant number of whom seem to be affiliated to the ruling party.Prof Mwesiga Baregu, a senior political science lecturer at St Augustine University of Tanzania and a member of the Chadema Central Committee, says an increasing number of celebrities joined the opposition cause ahead of the General Election in 2015.He, however, accuses CCM of outwitting the opposition by buying them. Since Ms Sepetu said fellow artistes would like to defect to the opposition but feared the authorities, Chadema is supposed to assure those who are ready that they will be safe, and should not fear intimidation, he says.Still, there are many who believe that the attention given to the former actress defection is much ado about nothing. They argue that what makes political parties sellable is their real agendas and manifestos. People decide for themselves.
