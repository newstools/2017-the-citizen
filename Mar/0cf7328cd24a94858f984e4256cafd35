Three people were killed and two others critically injured when the driver of a Toyota apparently lost control of his car and rolled on the R36 at Mokgoloboto in Limpopo late on Friday night, paramedics said. At the time of their arrival, ER24 paramedics found one patient in the back of the car and one patient lying a few metres away from the car, ER spokeswoman Annine Dormehl said on Saturday. As the paramedics prepared to transport the man they found on the ground to hospital, his heart rate dropped significantly and he had to be resuscitated. After about 20 minutes of resuscitation nothing more could be done for the man and he was declared dead on the scene. Two patients were transported to nearby hospitals in the area by other emergency services. It was not clear what caused the car to roll and local authorities were on the scene for further investigations, Dormehl said. African News Agency (ANA)
