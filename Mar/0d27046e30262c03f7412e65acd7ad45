President Jacob Zuma has finally opened up about why he allegedly wants to fire Minister of Finance Pravin Gordhan to the ANC top six. In a meeting, Zuma reportedly told the top six that he had concerns over Gordhan&#8217;s close relationship with &#8220;white monopoly capital&#8221;. He further presented former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe as a suitable candidate to replace the minister. However, The Mail &amp; Guardian is reporting the top six is divided on the matter. Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe and treasurer Zweli Mkhize have reportedly opposed the removal of Gordhan. According to the report, the president had intended to announce Gordhan&#8217;s sacking on Tuesday but received a warning that members of the top six would publicly voice their disagreement. President Jacob Zuma on Monday recalled Gordhan and Mcebisi Jonas from National Treasury s international investment roadshow in London, a call that raised eyebrows, with many suspecting the president would soon fire the minister and replace him with former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe. After being spotted at the ANC s headquarters at Luthuli House earlier on Tuesday, Gordhan later said he was there to have a discussion . However, Gordhan further said he had not yet been told why he was recalled from London. But EFF leader Julius Malema said when Gordhan met with ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe on Tuesday, he was told that the president had decided to reshuffle Cabinet, a decision the minister had previously said was the president s prerogative to make. Not only was Gordhan told Zuma would reshuffle Cabinet, but also that Gwede confirmed that Zuma wants Brian Molefe as finance minister , said the EFF leader.
