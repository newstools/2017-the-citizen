Seasoned &#8220;salt&#8221; artist Percy Maimela has released a portrait of late musician and actor Joe &#8220;Sdumo&#8221; Mafela using salt. The image making the rounds on Twitter and Instagram is an almost perfect one of the Shebeleza hit maker. Maimale uses a spray bottle with salt and a dark floor to make his amazing artwork.
