About a year ago, Johannes Jonker came up with lowly Border to Ellis Park and unexpectedly beat a fancied Lions side during the Currie Cup qualifying tournament. On Saturday, the 22-year-old will play at tighthead against a Test-quality side, the Jaguares, in Buenos Aires &#8211; for the side he plotted against 11 months ago. It&#8217;s typical of the Lions to recruit this way, always looking for a bargain.

Yet the story is actually even less scientific than that. &#8220;I was actually watching Border playing on television in one of my hotel rooms,&#8221; said Johan Ackermann, the Lions head coach. &#8220;I saw Johannes play quite well and thought to myself this is someone to look at. We started making enquiries about him and followed him around a bit. There is definitely potential and we decided to take a punt.&#8221; Jonker&#8217;s rise is notable. This is a man who went from playing lowly first division rugby at the end of last season to straight into Super Rugby action. There was no &#8220;in-between&#8221; exposure for him to get used to the massive jump between facing the Griffons and facing the Jaguares. He&#8217;s already made two appearances as a substitute this season, now Jonker is a starter. &#8220;Johannes joined us in the off-season and trained really well,&#8221; said Ackermann. &#8220;He carried a niggle that prevented him from playing his best in the warm-up matches but recovered really quickly. We still see the things in his play that excited us last year.&#8221; The Lions coaching staff are undoubtedly taking a risk in promoting him so early, especially as he&#8217;s come on in the past two matches will the scrum well set. But Ackermann isn&#8217;t worried because he believes Jonker will tread the same path as the man he has to deputise for: Springbok Julian Redelinghuys. &#8220;When Johannes arrived here, I saw Julian,&#8221; said the Lions mentor. &#8220;I believe he has the ability to become just as good as him. And it&#8217;s never a bad thing to expose a player to a big test early on. &#8220;Julian got hammered in 2014&#8217;s tournament by the Crusaders&#8217; All Black front row. Look how he took that lesson in his stride. We&#8217;re hoping Johannes follows the same path.&#8221; That&#8217;s supposedly the same reasoning for Ackermann and co promoting 21-year-old Shaun Reynolds &#8211; a young man with a big boot &#8211; to steer the ship at flyhalf. And, to date, this type of faith is working.
