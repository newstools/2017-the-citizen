The Republic&#8217;s attempts to subdue Real Madrid forward Bale will form a major part of the Group D leaders&#8217; game-plan in Dublin. Having seen his team snuff out Sweden striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic at Euro 2016, Republic captain Coleman is confident they can do the same to Bale. &#8220;We are a team which has played against big players in the past &#8211; I remember when we played Sweden in the summer, all the talk was about Zlatan and it&#8217;s quite similar this time,&#8221; Coleman said on Thursday. &#8220;But we are fully focused on our job and looking forward to the game. Look, as I said, we were getting asked the same questions in the summer about certain players and you have got another 10 players on the pitch you have got to worry about. &#8220;We know he&#8217;s a world-class player and we are going to have to be careful and get tight to him in certain areas, but we can&#8217;t just fully focus on Gareth Bale. &#8220;They have got a lot of good players and we need to make sure they worry about us as well.&#8221; Everton right-back Coleman needs no reminding of just how good Bale can be having had to deal with him in the wake of one of his finest performances in a Tottenham shirt back in October 2010. Three days after the former Southampton trainee had scored a Champions League hat-trick against Inter Milan at the San Siro, Coleman and his Everton team-mates travelled to White Hart Lane and secured a 1-1 draw. &#8220;When he was doing really well against the likes of Inter Milan, I was a right midfielder and whenever we played them, it was a doubling-up job with Phil Neville. It had to be done,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But he&#8217;s really kicked on and he&#8217;s gone on to great things.&#8221; Republic manager Martin O&#8217;Neill was giving nothing away on his plans to shackle Bale, but admitted there would be times when the 27-year-old would hurt his side. &#8220;Of course there are going to be moments in matches when great players extricate themselves from difficult positions and cause you problems &#8211; that&#8217;s why they are great players,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s that type of thing that we will try to cut to a minimum if we can. But naturally being a brilliant player, he will cause us problems.&#8221;
