A-Reece, Fifi Cooper and Benchmarq left their record label, Ambitious Entertainment almost a month ago. They left on a bad note with A-Reece saying he had been paid R20,000 a month despite being booked for gigs and being one of the record label&#8217;s most successful artists. The young rapper also questioned how PR managers at the company bought new cars while he couldn&#8217;t yet afford to get one. Benchmarq and Fifi Cooper also leveled damning allegations against Ambitiouz Entertainment, with Benchmarq suggesting that they bought awards instead of contesting fairly for them. According to Sunday World, Kgosi Mahumapelo the owner of Ambitiouz, where rapper Emtee is and singer Amanda Black are based, has issued a legal instruction to radio stations and TV networks to stop playing the music of the departed artists and told promoters to not book songs which were recorded by the artists under the label. &#8220;I have been advised to not speak to the media about this matter until the legal process has been completed. But this shouldn&#8217;t be seen as a war against the radio stations or promoters. We are just exercising our rights as a record company,&#8221; said Mahumapelo. The SABC and YFM have stated they will not comply with the instruction. &#8220;All these artists are still on our playlists and will be in future provided they give us good music,&#8221; said YFM programmes manager Tshepo Pule.
