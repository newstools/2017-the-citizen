It can feel sneaky checking your child s internet use and by far the best approach is to have an open dialogue with your child about internet safety issues and what to do if things go wrong.There are however things you can do to double check if the sites your child is visiting are appropriate.Check browser history: This is the most basic way to keep tabs on your child s online footpath.All internet browsers save a record of the sites that have been visited.In Internet Explorer you can access the history via the Tools menu.In Chrome you ll need to click on the wrench button in the top right-hand corner and select history.Use your wireless router: Some wireless routers keep a log of what sites are visited via your home internet connection.You ll need to set up logging by typing your router IP address into the address bar on your browser.To find out your IP address, check the manufacturer s documentation.All routers come with a default static (fixed) IP address, so unless you ve bothered to go in and change it, you should be able to locate it fairly easily.Otherwise, if you re running Windows 10, enter cmd in the search field and click the top result to access the Command Prompt.When in the command prompt window type in ipconfig to bring up information on your network connection.The default gateway shows the IP address of the router you are connected to.Alternatively, if you re on a MacOS, the information can be found in system preferences.Go to Network and select the tab that corresponds to your connection.Click on Advanced and then click on the TCP/IP tab.Here you ll find the IP address either as Router or Default Gateway. Now you have your IP address type it into the browser bar on your computer.You may be prompted to enter a password.If you ve never set one the default username and password can be found on the packaging your router came in or you ll find it on the manufacturer s website.Once you have accessed your router, click on Logs to view activity.You can set up site blocking here too.Use software to monitor internet usage Parental control software is a good place to start, especially when your children are younger.An uncensored internet is a huge playground for kids and just as we protect them at the park, there s no reason why you can t put in place parental controls online as well.While software can t do everything, it can at least enable you to set rules, schedules and block unsuitable content.There are lots of great free software options offering parental control tools.Check out Qustodio, OpenDNS Family Shield, Kidlogger, Spyrix Free Keylogger and Zoodles.Remember when it comes to your child s internet usage, a policy of proper education, mutual trust and respect is the best way to handle the issue of safety.woman@thecitizen.co.tz
