Akani Simbine, who is currently the fastest man in the world this year, has already stirred interest for next month&#8217;s national championships in Potchefstroom. The 23-year-old sprinter, who clocked 9.93 earlier this month at a meet in Pretoria, took to Twitter to engage in some banter with his nearest rivals. First, he asked Henricho Bruintjies if he&#8217;s ready to defend his national 100m title. Simbine lost out to Bruintjies last year in Stellenbosch but clearly feels confident of gaining revenge. https://twitter.com/AkaniSimbine/status/844843063679709184 But his rival, who hails from Paarl, took leaf out of Basketball legend Michael Jordan&#8217;s book. Jordan won three consecutive titles for 1996-1998 with the Chicago Bulls, leading to Bruintjies&#8217; reference. What&#39;s #KingB saying? &quot;Back to back like jordan 96/97&#8230;just show up!!! #fillupPotch https://t.co/Yd0zgXyhGF &mdash; Henricho (@KINGBRUINTJIES) March 23, 2017 There&#8217;s another potential stumbling block for Simbine though: Olympic hero Wayde van Niekerk will be competing for national 100m title. Hope you kept it safe and warm for me King B https://t.co/9LLS3rOzZP &mdash; Wayde van Niekerk (@WaydeDreamer) March 23, 2017 Not that he&#8217;s too worried about having to race the 400m world record holder. https://twitter.com/AkaniSimbine/status/844842719377702912 It all promises to be a fascinating meet next month.
