The number of tobacco smokers is increasing day by day and a number of smokers are unaware of the harmful effects of smoking.Smoking has a devastating health and economic impact on people and the repercussions do not only affect the smokers but non-smokers alike.Smoking is known to cause more deaths than HIV/AIDs, tuberculosis and malaria. Hence anti-smoking campaigns and new policies need to be created in order to reduce smoking in the general population especially children.One of the biggest issues with tobacco smoking is the number of diseases it causes and this has a big impact on the morbidity and mortality rates in different areas. Here are some of the potential diseases caused by smoking.COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease)COPD is a lung disease that causes the airway to be inflamed leading to early death.Smoking causes the toxic smoke to pass through the airways which leads to a decrease in oxygen flowing in and out of the airway due to inflammation.COPD is known to cause long term disability; making it hard to climb stairs, being active and doing day to day activities.Symptoms of COPD include coughing mucus for a long time and shortness of breath especially during exercise.Hence, long term smoking or even second hand smoking leads to slow degradation of the lungs and eventually death.Lung cancerTobacco smoking is known to be the number one risk factor for lung cancer; it is responsible for almost 87 per cent of lung cancer deaths.Tobacco smoke is made up of many toxic chemicals and most of them are known to cause cancer. The smoke damages the cells that line the lungs and damages the lung tissues.Some symptoms of lung cancer include coughing blood, sudden weight loss, shortness of breath and long term cough.Heart diseaseTobacco smoking leads to majority of heart disease cases in patients under 65 years of age. Smoking causes blockages and narrowing of arteries, which leads to less oxygen reaching in the heart.Inhaling smoke increases heart rate and blood pressure and also lowers good cholesterol levels due to its reaction with the blood vessels. Furthermore, because the smoke block arteries, it can trigger stroke.AsthmaAsthma is known to be a chronic lung disease which makes it harder to breath and decreases the movement of air in the lungs.Smoking irritates the air passages and it can cause sudden and severe asthma attacks. The smoke damages the tiny hair like structures called cilia, which help to sweep dust and mucus, hence this allows dust and mucus to accumulate in the airways.Furthermore, children whose parents smoke are more prone to having asthma and infections than those who don t.DiabetesThe risk of developing type 2 diabetes is 30 to 40 per cent higher in smokers than non-smokers.Tobacco increases blood sugar levels which leads the body to become more insulin resistant.People who ve become insulin resistant cannot produce insulin and hence they need to be given insulin for controlling blood sugar levels.Uncontrolled blood sugar levels lead to complications related to kidneys, heart and blood vessels. Some manufacturers add sugar in cigarettes, which causes smokers to crave sugary products leading to diabetes.In conclusion, the chemicals in a cigarette smoke enter our blood and affects the entire body causing numerous diseases.Smoking cessation programs should be encouraged and sale of tobacco products need to be controlled. More stringent rules for tobacco use have to be put in place in order to safe guard the public.
