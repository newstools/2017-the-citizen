eThekwini firefighters were hard at work on Friday night, extinguishing a fire at a warehouse on Southcoast Road in Rossburgh, KwaZulu-Natal, the municipality said. The eThekwini Municipality said that reports indicated that the fire started at around 9.30am. All relevant municipal departments were immediately activated to ensure that the incident was dealt with efficiently and effectively. Preliminary reports from Environment Health practitioners indicate that the warehouse contains a large volume of wax and polypropylene (plastic), the eThekwini Municipality said in a statement. The smoke from the fire is moving over the City as a result of strong 40-50km South Westerly winds. The smoke is not at this point coming to ground within the city, but is moving towards the northern direction. No injuries have been reported and the cause of the fire is unknown. The municipality urged people who come into contact with the smoke to stay indoors and close all windows and doors as well as ensure that air-conditioning systems are switched off. Southcoast Road has been closed between the M7 and Bayhead Road. Due to the poor visibility emanating from the smoke, motorists are advised to keep their headlights on and drive cautiously.
