Sunday night&#8217;s episode of Mzansi Magic&#8217;s Date My Family raised eyebrows when Twitter dug up a few files on bachelor General, real name Mosome Thekiso. General, an advocate, politician, farmer and preacher looking for love, approached the dating show to look for a woman who is traditional, caring and &#8220;has love and will respect him and his family&#8221; One thing General never wants you to forget about him is that he is an advocate, a point that may have led to his failed date. After not liking his LLB programme, General decided to stick to farming and being a councillor in a community, but he did not reveal which political party he belonged to. Also being a part-time pastor, General refused wine when one of the families offered some, further telling Zinhle, the girl he ended up picking, that he was not looking for a woman who would go out partying and come back home at 4am. When asked if he had a car, he said no. &#8220;I don&#8217;t have a car, I have many cars,&#8221; he said. He owns a BMW, Mercedes and a polo, he claimed. Does he have a house? No. &#8220;I have houses,&#8221; he said one that he lives in and two for investment purposes. After the dates with family members, General picked the last one because of the food and their character. But things turned sour during the date after Zinhle said she was not ready to settle. In fact, she was not even sure she wanted to get married. She further told General there would not be a second date, as she was not the kind of woman he was looking for. General, allegedly an EFF member, did not take the rejection well, especially coming from a &#8220;mere&#8221; chartered accountant. He said Zinhle was a spoiled brat who just did not know what she wanted in life. &#8220;I am a senior to her &#8230; make more money. I&#8217;m an admitted attorney. She is a mere chartered accountant,&#8221; he said. This is how Twitter reacted: Fighter @Sentletse look what we have in @EFFSouthAfrica General in the flesh #DateMyFamily #CSITwitter pic.twitter.com/JonaToksiH &mdash; Cam (@CamModisane) March 12, 2017 This General guy I hate him.
