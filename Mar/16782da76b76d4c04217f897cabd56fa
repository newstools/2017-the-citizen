Rapper Kiernan &#8216;AKA&#8217; Forbes has come to the rescue of his friend Simiso &#8216;Okmalumkoolkat&#8217; Zwane after a City Press headline that reads &#8220;AKA collaborates with convicted sex offender Okmalumkoolkat on new cover&#8221;. In a series of tweets, AKA said the publication was making its agenda too obvious by writing the headline now that Okmalumkoolkat had worked with him, when he had also worked on other projects since his release from prison. Okmalumkoolkat designed the artwork for AKA&#8217;s latest single, Caiphus Song. Though he has admitted that Okmalumkoolkat did make a mistake, he says he has been punished and was still paying for it, further clarifying that the rapper did not rape anyone. &#8220;That man owes nobody an explanation except for the victim, his own child and his family. The rest of you self righteous rubbishes can go jump!&#8221; Next time Chris Brown is here I hope you self righteous ones treat Chris Brown like you tryna treat Kool Kat. BE CONSISTENT. Not CONVENIENT. &mdash; AKA (@akaworldwide) March 7, 2017 He further called South Africans hypocrites for not protesting when American artists Chris Brown and R. Kelly came to Mzansi. &#8220;Why scream your lungs out at a convicted woman abusers concert when he performs in SA? Why y&#8217;all don&#8217;t tweet brands who sponsor his show? &#8220;Next time Chris Brown is here I hope you self righteous ones treat Chris Brown like you trying to treat Kool Kat. Be consistent. Not convenient,&#8221; he said. Why scream your lungs out at a convicted woman abusers concert when he performs in SA? Why y&#39;all don&#39;t tweet brands who sponsor his show? &mdash; AKA (@akaworldwide) March 7, 2017 The publication trended on Monday for the headline, which divided Twitter. Some said it was unnecessary to remind South Africans of Okmalumkoolkat&#8217;s past mistakes, while some commended it for &#8220;calling a spade a spade&#8221;. Y&#39;all will scream your Fuckin&#39; lungs out for R. Kelly won&#39;t you?! &#8230;.. &mdash; AKA (@akaworldwide) March 7, 2017 The rapper was arrested last year in Australia. Zwane had played at a cultural festival on Friday night, after which he went out with friends, only to return to a hotel where the victim was sleeping the following day. Zwane, who was found guilty of indecent assault and assault with indecent intent, was sentenced to six months in jail with five months suspended. Speaking to Anele Mdoda on Real Talk, the rapper admitted that he was drunk when he walked in to the victim&#8217;s room, but was only trying to find his way to his hotel room. &#8220;Because I was drunk, instead of knocking, I just walked through. And then obviously &#8211; I would probably act the same way if somebody was in my room &#8211; it&#8217;s scary. She woke up, and then she ushered me out of the room.&#8221; The woman later laid charges against him, further alleging that she had changed her statement.
