Pieter-Dirk Uys is bringing his one-man memoir to Johannesburg after its successful debut last year. From March 22, The Echo of a Noise comes to the Studio Theatre at Montecasino. In the show, Tannie Evita and Bambi Kellermann are there only in spirit and only in the roles they play in Uys s story. The Echo of a Noise follows the small signposts the playwright and activist followed throughout his life. He believes everything pointed him in the right direction, culminating in more than 7 000 performances to his name. In The Echo of a Noise, Uys removes the masks, the eyelashes and the personas and opens his heart, taking the audiences on a journey into his public and private life.
