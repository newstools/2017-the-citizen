Hundreds of EFF members were marching around the Constitutional Court in Johannesburg in support of imprisoned Fees Must Fall activist Bonginkosi Khanyile who would be challenging the failure of his bail an application on Wednesday morning. Khanyile was arrested on September last year whilst out on bail in connection with alleged violence during the countrywide protest. He was first arrested in February last year in another incident during Fees Must Fall protests. The KZN student&#8217;s continued detention has sparked several protests, vigils and nationwide calls for his release since he became known as the last Fees Must Fall prisoner. Khanyile faces several charges including convening or gathering without notice, convening or attending an illegal gathering or demonstration, interference with police duties in an illegal gathering and trespassing. #FreeBonginkosiKhanyile another group flocking in saying they will go home with #BonginkosiKhanyile @News24 pic.twitter.com/lRrxc7de6y &mdash; Sisa Canca (@squire208) March 1, 2017 &nbsp;
