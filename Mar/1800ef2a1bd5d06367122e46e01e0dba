South African property developer and investor Atterbury Property is set to open a 18,500 square metre modern mall in Ghana s city of Kumasi, at a cost of U.S.$95 million. Atterbury said the mall, with potential for a future 10,000 square metre expansion, would give the city of Kumasi its first one-stop environment with shopping and entertainment under one roof when it opens on 20 April. Kumasi City Mall s anchor tenants are Shoprite and Walmart brand Game Stores, with a retail mix including food, convenience, banking, services, fashion, electronics and a cinema, club and children s games for entertainment. With access from the Eastern Bypass of the city s main ring road, Kumasi City Mall is nestled between the dual carriageway Lake Road, Hudson Road, Yaa Asantewa Road, and Kofi Adomako Street. Atterbury is developing Kumasi City Mall for its owners. AttAfrica has been appointed asset manager and would be responsible for its day-to-day running and operations. Cobus van Heerden, retail director at Atterbury Property Development, said this was the first big development the company had undertaken in Kumasi. We are optimistic about Ghana and Kumasi City Mall, notwithstanding the challenging economic context in West Africa, and competition. There s a growing positive feeling about Ghana in the market, van Heerden said in a statement. With its new president, there is also renewed confidence and positive sentiment about Ghana. Kumasi City Mall is perfectly timed for this upsurge in confidence. The mall was designed in a joint venture between South African architect practice Boogertman and Partners, and Ghanaian practice MultiCAD. All firms in Kumasi City Mall s professional team operated with local partners for the delivery of professional services. Atterbury is set to open another two shopping centre developments in sub-Saharan Africa, in Mozambique and Namibia, over the next six months. African News Agency (ANA)
