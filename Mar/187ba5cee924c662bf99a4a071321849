Since the unveiling of the TV veteran&#8217;s tombstone, social media has reacted to how flashy it is, with TimesLIVE reporting that it costs more than R100 000 and below R300 000. Bataung Memorial Tombstone&#8217;s CEO Lebohang Khitsane told the website the family had approached them to come up with a unique design to incorporate Mafela&#8217;s TV career and how he kept millions entertained throughout his long career. &#8220;The family was extremely happy with the design and our team worked hard to make it in just three days,&#8221; Khitsane said.

Talk about levels even in death. &mdash; SoKaliSa (@TheKingzz_Son) March 29, 2017 You can&#39;t expect Joe Mafela to have a similar tombstone to your grandfather.

He was such an important part of people&#8217;s lives, and we really loved the idea of having him immortalised like this. Joe loved nothing more than to come home at the end of the day and just sit on the couch and watch TV,&#8221; Mafela family spokesperson Millicent &#8216;Milly&#8217; Mulelu said.
