President Jacob Zuma is expected to visit uMhlabuyalingana Local Municipality in northern KwaZulu-Natal as part of government s intensified campaign against crime blamed for heightened tensions between SA citizens and migrants from neighbouring countries. Zuma s spokesperson, Bongani Ngqulunga, said the Presidency had received complaints about high and intolerable levels of cross-border crime, including stock theft and carjackings. The crimes are affecting municipalities that border Swaziland and Mozambique. The president will inspect the border, speak to the local police as well as engage with the communities of uMkhanyakude, Hlabisa and Jozini municipalities, said Ngqulunga. Zuma recently visited the communities of Nyanga township in Cape Town and Soshanguve in Tshwane as part of the fight against crime. The president will visit the area on Tuesday. Zuma will be accompanied by KwaZulu-Natal Premier Willies Mchunu, cabinet ministers, MECs and mayors. African News Agency (ANA) For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
