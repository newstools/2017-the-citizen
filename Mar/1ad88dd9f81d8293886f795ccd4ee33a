It seems Bongekile &#8216;Babes Wodumo&#8217; Simelane is not the only one in her family who can dance. The &#8216;Wololo&#8217; sensation has introduced her younger sister to us, also showing us what a dancer she is, in a video that she recently posted. She said she was attending umembeso with her little sister when the music started blasting, the two could not handle the heat, so they started dancing. Now we don&#8217;t know who should be the national treasure between the two.
