In a statement this week, the organisers of Sexpo have said that this year&#8217;s event at Sandton Convention Centre will be about &#8220;making sex great again&#8221;. This year there will be a focus on wellness and enjoying a healthy sex life. They wrote: &#8220;Sex: whether it&#8217;s taboo, whispered about behind closed doors, joked about or discussed in the doctor&#8217;s office, it&#8217;s an integral part of being human. Sexpo, SA&#8217;s premier health, sexuality and lifestyle expo, is campaigning to make sex great again by ensuring that sex and sexuality are topics that are on everybody&#8217;s lips. The popular erotic expo will be held from Wednesday 22 March through to Saturday 25 March at the Sandton Convention Centre, in Exhibition Halls 1 and 2. &#8220;For years, Sexpo has been tantalising SA audiences with an array of thrilling exhibits: from stunning adult film stars and adrenaline packed-stage shows to cheeky competitions and shopping opportunities galore. However, Sexpo is not just about the tease. This expo is a vital part of creating an open conversation about the various facets of human sexuality, what turns people on and how to have a healthy and enjoyable sex life.&#8221; To market their event, they made a video mash-up of Donald Trump &#8220;singing&#8221; Salt-N-Pepa&#8217;s biggest hit. They said &#8220;Sexpo&#8217;s tongue-in-cheek ad campaign featuring a certain famous American commander in chief, highlights that we need to get the conversation flowing around sex and make sex great again. Sean Newman, managing director of Sexpo, said: &#8220;At Sexpo we strive to bring all the facets of sexuality to light and to stimulate conversation. It&#8217;s important to talk about the ins and outs of human sexuality but there is no reason why it can&#8217;t be done in a fun and enjoyable way. That&#8217;s why we want to make sex great again, for everyone!&#8221; The line-up at Sexpo ranges from appearances by Miss Nude SA, adult film stars Jessa Rhodes and Anna Bell Peaks and Pricasso the painter, to the Theatre Erotic, the Sexpo Workshops and even Man Cave strip poker. There will be numerous lounges such as a Swingers Lounge, a BDSM area and Teasers and Teaze-Hers Lounges. According to the organisers, &#8220;One not-to-be-missed attraction is the international Thunder from Down Under stage show. These hot Australian hunks are hitting Sexpo straight from Las Vegas and their sizzling dance routines and gorgeous looks will have the audience swooning. Catch them at the Thunder Dome area, which can be accessed with the purchase of a Sexpo ticket. Thunder Down Under shows are at 7.30pm on Wednesday and Thursday, 8pm on Friday and 12 and 7pm on Saturday. Anyone who wishes to attend should get there early, as doors open an hour prior to each show and seating is on a first-come, first serve basis.&#8221;
