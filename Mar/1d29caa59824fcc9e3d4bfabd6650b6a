Award-winning radio host Masechaba Ndlovu took to Twitter on Friday to announce that she will no longer appear on air for Power FM. She did not reveal what the reasons for the decision is, nor what her further plans might be, though there has recently been an exodus of radio talent leaving for online platforms. Metro FM&#8217;s Glen Lewis also left Metro FM this week to work with Tbo Touch at Touch Central. Many have speculated that this might be part of the growth of online radio in South Africa. Ndlovu said that she wished the Houghton-based talk radio station, which plays music on weekends, all the best. It has reportedly been struggling to grow its audience base since its launch in 2013. I have resigned from PowerFM with immediate effect. Thank you all for your unwavering love and support. Wishing the station all of the best. &mdash; Masechaba Ndlovu (@MasechabaNdlovu) March 24, 2017
