Suarez scored Barca&#8217;s equaliser early in the second half, but the visitors&#8217; poor defending from corners was punished by Joselu and Alex Bergantinos to hand struggling Deportivo their first win over Barca since 2008. &#8220;Just because you win one game doesn&#8217;t solve the problems of a season, nor does losing one mean all is lost,&#8221; Suarez told BeIN Sports Spain. Barca boss Luis Enrique accepted it had been &#8220;difficult&#8221; for his side to lift themselves from the tiredness and euphoria of pulling off the biggest comeback in Champions League history from a 4-0 first-leg deficit. However, despite missing the injured Neymar, Suarez claimed Barca had enough recovery time to put in a better performance than they showed at Riazor. &#8220;There was enough time to recover and we were aware that the league game was coming,&#8221; added the Uruguayan. Barca now lead Real Madrid at the top of La Liga by just a point having played two games more. Madrid can move top later on Sunday with victory at home to Real Betis. And Enrique claimed it will take a &#8220;very strong&#8221; end to the season in Barca&#8217;s remaining 11 league games to deliver a third consecutive title. &#8220;Now we have to think that we still have matches against our rivals for the title to come,&#8221; said Enrique. &#8220;We are going to have to have a very strong end to the season to be able to opt for trophies.&#8221;
