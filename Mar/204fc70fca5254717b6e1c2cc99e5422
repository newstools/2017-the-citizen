by Steven GRIFFITHS The 28-year-old was reported to have stormed off the training pitch last week before becoming involved in an angry confrontation with his team-mates, but he took part in training on Monday and shook hands with Wenger before the session. Sanchez started Saturday&#8217;s 3-1 Premier League defeat at Liverpool on the bench, coming on at half-time and making a goal for Danny Welbeck. Asked about the reports at a press conference prior to Tuesday&#8217;s Champions League last-16 second leg against Bayern Munich, Wenger said they were &#8220;completely false&#8221;. &#8220;Nothing happened, nothing at all,&#8221; Wenger told reporters at Arsenal&#8217;s London Colney base. &#8220;But I understand that you have to fill the newspapers and we respect that. When you don&#8217;t win the games there are sometimes stories.&#8221; Wenger said tactical factors had been the &#8220;unique reason&#8221; for his decision to start with Sanchez on the bench at Anfield, where Olivier Giroud and Welbeck started up front. &#8220;His attitude is he&#8217;s a committed player,&#8221; Wenger said of Sanchez. &#8220;Sometimes with excessive behaviours, but he&#8217;s been in every squad. &#8220;The definition of a happy person is very difficult. I never found the ideal one. &#8220;On the football front, it is to play well and win. I hope he is happy tomorrow.&#8221; Wenger said his relationship with Sanchez was &#8220;honest and normal, like with every single player&#8221; and played down the possibility the Chile forward might leave the club during the close season. &#8220;Alexis Sanchez has 15 months on his contract so the decision on whether he stays will depend on Arsenal Football Club, not on anybody else,&#8221; said the Frenchman. While Wenger tried his best to keep the peace, he did express frustration with Sanchez&#8217;s recent performances in Arsenal&#8217;s most important matches. &#8220;Sanchez played in all the games when we didn&#8217;t perform, at Manchester City, Chelsea,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Everybody is a top player at this level. It&#8217;s not down to one individual. It&#8217;s important we all perform as a team.&#8221; Pressed on whether Sanchez would be restored to the starting line-up on Tuesday at the Emirates Stadium, Wenger said he was yet to make up his mind. &#8220;You will have to come to the game (to find out). I will decide tomorrow morning,&#8221; he said. At the same time Wenger was facing the media, Sanchez tried to put the storm behind him as he took to Instagram to express his commitment to the Arsenal cause. &#8220;The true warrior fights not because he hates the ones in front of him, but because he loves those behind him. Let&#8217;s go Gunners. The only failure is not trying,&#8221; Sanchez wrote. &#8211; Displays of frustration &#8211; He has been linked with a move away from Arsenal at the end of the season, with Juventus and Paris Saint-Germain among the clubs reported to be monitoring the situation. Arsenal slipped out of the Champions League places following the weekend loss at Liverpool and must overturn a 5-1 deficit against Bayern to remain alive in this season&#8217;s competition. Sanchez, a July 2014 signing from Barcelona, is Arsenal&#8217;s top scorer this season with 20 goals in all competitions and is seen as their most important player along with German playmaker Mesut Ozil. But as Arsenal&#8217;s form has dipped, his on-pitch displays of frustration have become increasingly noticeable. Wenger conceded on Saturday that his decision not to start with Sanchez at Anfield had backfired, but said he had &#8220;no special regrets&#8221;
