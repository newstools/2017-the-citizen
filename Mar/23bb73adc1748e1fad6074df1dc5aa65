Last week &#8211; much like his side&#8217;s performance &#8211; supporters saw the best and worst of Rohan Janse van Rensburg. For 40 minutes against the Kings, the exciting Lions centre was unstoppable. He scored a try, slipped past a defender twice and even threatened to burst through a few tackles. And then came the four handling errors, three of them in a pretty poor second half. But this doesn&#8217;t mean Janse van Rensburg is ripe for the taking on Saturday against the Sharks at Ellis Park.

But I&#8217;m cool with it now, these things happen. It&#8217;s very important to realise you won&#8217;t have a perfect game every week and move on.&#8221; By all accounts he&#8217;s actually allowed to have had one ordinary game &#8211; it wasn&#8217;t even for a whole game &#8211; because the Springbok midfielder has almost completely sidestepped &#8220;second season syndrome&#8221;. Given how opponents are now aware of him after a superb 2016, many expected his influence to become less. It hasn&#8217;t. &#8220;It&#8217;s been a fantastic year, I&#8217;ve been blessed,&#8221; said Janse van Rensburg. &#8220;The way to stay ahead is pretty simple. Every week we talk about the need to improve. It&#8217;s part of our culture, that&#8217;s how we keep performing.&#8221; One of the features of his season to date has been the way he&#8217;s simply bulldozed out of tackles. It&#8217;s nowadays a rare and thrilling sight as most coaches now preach players to look for space instead. Janse van Rensburg does both. &#8220;Well, you&#8217;ve got to pick your battle,&#8221; he said with a smile. &#8220;You can&#8217;t just run into any defender. It&#8217;s a state of mind when you run with the ball. You decide when you want to hit the gap or when you can crash into an opponent. It&#8217;s a fine balance and a difficult one too but I try my best.&#8221; That&#8217;s a bit of an understatement.
