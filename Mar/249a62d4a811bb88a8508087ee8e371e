He said he would get there without using publicity stunts, in a tweet that left many wondering if he was throwing shade at AKA for his breakup stunt. No PR stunts Here!!!

Get ready!!! pic.twitter.com/ONmazXkdVm &mdash; Abuti Fill Up (@CassperNyovest) March 9, 2017 The rapper always breaks records, and AKA knows that. He recently took to Twitter to tell fans that topping the charts was good, but said that he was just happy that his music was &#8220;better than everyone else&#8217;s right now&#8221;. &#8220;You know, it&#8217;s possible to top the charts with rubbish, I get my satisfaction from knowing that the people are feeling the vibes,&#8221; he said. The two rivals left fans wondering if Cassper had paid AKA to hype up his music, as the two only started talking trash about each other&#8217;s music recently. Only time will tell the Twitter detectives are definitely on it. Also read: Malema negotiates with Cassper on royalties for Tito Mboweni
