We cannot truly credit that the ANC Youth League in the Free State could consider the SABC s discredited former chief operating officer Hlaudi Motsoeneng as a likely cabinet minister. Yet the league s provincial chairperson, Makalo Mohale, blandly came out and said that Motsoeneng s skills were too valuable to be wasted, and formally proposed him for a vacant post in parliament. This country has more serious things to consider than to take proposals of this nature seriously and the league has been weakened by its own lack of cohesion and direction since the seemingly tongue-tied Collen Maine (an alarmingly ancient &#8220;youth leader&#8221; going on for 37 years old) took over as president of the floundering youth arm of the ANC in 2015. And Maine has still to offer a credible explanation for his recent purchase of a R5 million home amid claims he has the Guptas to thank for it. Even for an organisation as riven with internal strife and factionalism as the ANC has displayed lately, this latest misstep from the youth league is almost beyond comprehension. Motsoeneng s record at the public broadcaster has been roundly criticised from virtually all angles as being self-seeking, divisive and dictatorial &#8230; hardly attributes to bring to a ministerial position any ministerial position.
