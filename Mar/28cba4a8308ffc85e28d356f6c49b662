Jon-Jon Smuts and Richard Levi treated PPC Newlands to magnificent centuries as the Warriors emerged victorious by 90 runs from their Momentum One-Day Cup clash against the BuildNat Cape Cobras in Cape Town on Sunday. Visiting captain Smuts, first struck a career-best unbeaten 173 (164 balls, 9 fours, 8 sixes) as the men from the Eastern Cape amassed 305/6 after they lost the toss and were put in to bat. Fellow opener Levi then hit 106 (70 balls, 14 fours, 3 sixes) in a two-part innings but it was a stand-alone effort as the home side succumbed for 215 in 37.3 overs. It was a fantastic effort by both men Smuts knock first up became the third highest individual score in domestic one-day cricket history behind Reeza Hendricks (181) and Morne van Wyk (175*) and highest for his franchise. It also beat his previous best of 132 scored against the Dolphins in 2011/12. Gihahn Cloete proved useful with 70 (75 balls, 11 fours) and shared in a 119-run opening stand that was broken by on-loan spinner Eddie Leie, who took an impressive 4/56. Chasing 306 to win, the Cobras made a flying start as they reached 124/2 in only 17 overs thanks to the bludgeoning hitting of Levi, but he then retired hurt on 94 and things went downhill from there. Omphile Ramela s 20 was the next highest score as Colin Ingram picked up 3/56, with good support coming via Aya Gqamane (2/22). Levi, who holds the record for the fastest century in 53 balls, returned to bat at 167/6, but despite completing his ton in 65 deliveries, he was eventually run out with the Warriors sealing a bonus-point win.
