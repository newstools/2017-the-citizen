HIV infection among children and adolescents poses a complex management issue and a medical dilemma.With increased access to HIV treatment throughout Africa, a generation of HIV positive children is now transitioning to adulthood while living with the chronic condition.Swallowing capsules or seeping syrups that keep their immune systems functioning becomes their daily routine.In fact the younger, among them, may not even remember a life without antiretroviral medicines (ARVs).Most HIV positive children/ adolescents have parents with HIV/Aids or are orphaned or living with the care takers who mostly are the grand parents or any other guardians in the family.At times, these children/adolescents are also responsible for taking care of their sick parents or other care takers who are elders.On top of all this, disclosing the HIV status to children and adolescents becomes another big challenge.Many studies have indicated that a large number of children and adolescents have not been informed about their status despite the fact that they are taking their daily medicines ARVS, without knowing why they do so.Disclosure and the provision of comprehensive and accurate information is only one part of the support children living with HIV need in the process of coming to terms with the disease.A study on HIV-positive adolescents perceptions of their present and future lives has once concluded that generally, HIV was viewed among the adolescents as a negative aspect of life and as physically and emotionally painful. The study, by Dominik Mattes published in 2014, titled: Life is not a rehearsal, it s a performance, found out that the children/ adolescents actually had more needs to deal with as they live with HIV, than just taking medications.It was an enquiry into the subjectivities of children and adolescents living with antiretroviral treatment in northeastern Tanzania.At this point, letting the children or adolescents live without knowing their status is not a good idea.Being fully informed about their health status contributes to children s ability to make sense of their situation and thus to their treatment adherence and gives them the opportunity to gain control of their life, to actively request social support from peers and relatives, and to maintain their dreams and hope for a positive future.The right way to break the iceHIV status disclosure to children should be carefully done and actually should consider several factors such as age of the child/ adolescent, with regard to developmental stage and ability to comprehend given information.Other circumstances to be considered are the child s health status--whether sick or not. Parental and family issues, such as whether the child is orphaned or not, who is the care taker, how old is the care taker, all matter.The process of disclosing requires a breakdown of information; making it a gradual process. That is to say that one may begin to let the child understand about chronic diseases and more as the child grows.The National HIV Treatment Guidelines and the World Health Organisation requires that disclosure should be done at early ages (pre-school age).Usually, one can start mentioning to a 4 6-year-old who is HIV-infected, that they have a chronic disease that requires regular clinic visits and medicines every day.At this age, the child starts asking questions about the disease or the medication he or she is taking, or acting in a way that suggests that he or she is feeling isolated from other children because of the disease.The process of disclosure should be undertaken by the parents or care givers and assisted by the health care providers.I would say that the most appropriate person to disclose the status to a child is a relative or biological parents (if alive) not uncles or other care givers.In some cases, I have seen far-fetched relatives such as uncles being used to disclose the status but generally it should be the parents and close relatives who should break the ice.It is very important children reach adolescent age understanding what it means living with HIV.Yet, for children just as for adults the decision of whom to disclose the status to means a lot.In their everyday life, the children have to constantly reconcile the idea of being socially integrated, normal family and community members with the one of being different and discriminated against on the basis of their health condition.Conclusively, children need support in their ongoing struggles not only with the challenging aspects of their treatment but also about their social lives.HIV/Aids complications, treatments side effects are also part of the bigger challenge.It is important to note that psychological and social support may help build on children s resilience and already existing strategies of coping with distress.But it s crucial to keep in mind that it is not [only] the individual child who needs to be taught, or changed, but the entire social environment and the wider political economy.
