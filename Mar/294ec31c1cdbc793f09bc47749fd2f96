According to the ANC Youth League that EFF president Julius Malema used to lead, political figures remain classified as &#8220;youth&#8221; up to the age of 35. Today, Malema turned 36. #EFF: Long Live Moshabi, Long Live amongst many leaders. Long Live Moshabi, Long Live!

In a statement, the EFF said Malema&#8217;s birthday was &#8220;a special day in the Economic Emancipation Movement, not just here in South Africa, but in the continent and the world&#8221;. &#8220;It is a special day because on this day, a giant was born for the historic task of advancing the African Revolution. Since his day of birth, he has grown to be the catalyst force behind the unfolding inevitable future of economic freedom and total emancipation of African people. &#8220;We want to express deep appreciation first to his family and wife who over the years have allowed this son of the soil to live for the cause of freedom for our people. We thank them because even as they love him and embrace him, because of the revolution, they too sacrifice that he may be always be present to command our picket-lines of revolutionary change. &#8220;On behalf of all fighters, we salute the CIC and wish him a long life. We wish that our mission may be true with him; that he may arrive with us all to the promise land of economic freedom in our lifetime. &#8220;The 36 years that he has lived thus far, he has lived to advance the humanity of black people. His name already stands in the same shining light as that of many African revolutionaries across the world. Like the names of Thomas Sankara, Patrice Lumumba, and Steven Biko, the name Julius Malema represents an unapologetic struggle for the absolute emancipation of African people. &#8220;On his birthday, we wish him well in his studies and express great pride that despite the work of building our revolution, he has managed to advance his academic achievements. This journey represents humility and love for knowledge that lacks amongst many leaders.&#8221;
