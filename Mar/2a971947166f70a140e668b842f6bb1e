Two society organisations have lodged hate speech complaints with the SA Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) against ANC Youth League (ANCYL) president Collen Maine for calling Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan a impimpi (spy). The Active Citizens Movement (ACM) and Johannesburg Against Injustice (JAI) believe that the youth leader s comments at the ANCYL s provincial elective conference in Durban incited violence and violated Gordhan s constitutional rights to life, dignity and personal security. The ACM and JAI strongly believe that such flagrant, unlawful and criminal conduct should not go unchallenged. It is our considered view that Maine s statements were deliberately crafted to incite violence against the minister and, if left unchecked, could have tragic consequences, the organisations said. They have also urged political leaders to ensure their followers behaved in a dignified and disciplined manner. After the Budget Speech on February 22, Maine told delegates at the Durban conference Gordhan was a sellout and questioned if the minister was representing the interests of white monopoly capital . He also spoke about how izimpimpi were dealt with during the struggle for freedom in the country. At the time, those regarded as spies were often necklaced for selling out their fellow comrades. The ANC has since distanced itself from Maine s comments. The party s spokesperson, Zizi Kodwa, said they viewed them as reckless and regrettable . It is worrying to use the word impimpi in the same line as Minister Gordhan. Gordhan is a cadre of the ANC. He knows nothing else but the ANC. It cannot be suggested that he comes from somewhere else, Kodwa said at the time. ALSO READ: Minister Dlamini looks worse by the day
