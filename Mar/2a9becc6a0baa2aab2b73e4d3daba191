Hot New Hip Hop put a list of their favourite female rappers from outside the United States in honour of International Women s Day yesterday. Hot New Hip Hop describe themselves as quickly becoming the premium destination for hip hop music and a promotional powerhouse for established artists and rising stars. They have one of the largest communities of hip hop aficionados on the web and serve as a direct link between artists and fans alike and attract over 8 million unique users monthly. Hot New Hip Hop found Gigi Lamayne s Shisha video to be a banger and likened her to Nicki Minaj. Gigi Lamayne s selection as an exciting female rapper from around the globe comes just off the back of hitting the 100 000 followers milestone on Instagram and being selected for the global PUMA #RunTheStreets campaign which launched in South Africa last month.,ayne
