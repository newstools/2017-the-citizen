A man is missing at sea after he apparently saved a family member from drowning at Pacaltsdorp Beach near George in the Western Cape on Sunday afternoon, paramedics said. It is believed that the man who saved the patient was swept away by the tide and a search is currently underway for the missing man, ER24 spokesperson Annine Dormehl said. The family member, a 21-year-old man, almost drowned. He was stabilised and transported to the George Provincial Hospital just after 3pm. When ER24 paramedics arrived on the scene they found the 21-year-old man on the beach surrounded by a crowd of people. Local authorities were on the scene, Dormehl said.
