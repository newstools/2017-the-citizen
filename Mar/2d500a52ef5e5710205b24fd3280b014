Four days after a five-year-old boy fell into a disused Boksburg mine, thought to be 140 metres deep, rescuers had still not found him. The boy from the informal settlement known as Jerusalem, outside Boksburg, fell into the shaft on Saturday afternoon. Ekurhuleni Emergency services spokesperson, William Ntladi, on Wednesday said rescue efforts were suspended last night . He said a meeting was going to be held to determine the next course of action. As soon as the meeting concludes, the rescue operations will resume. We suspended the operations last night due to challenges we encountered. An excavator was operating over night to help speed up the process. In a statement, the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), Mbuyiseni Ndlozi, said they call on a full government project to to attend to all abandoned and disused mines. The responsible mining companies must face the full might of law including compensation to communities and affected families, said Ndlozi. The blame must be put squarely at the feet of mining companies who after exploiting our mineral and labour resources leave open holes that now serves as graves, swallowing our people alive.
