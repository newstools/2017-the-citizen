The day has finally arrived for fight fans from all over as the first Extreme Fighting Championship (EFC) fight card of 2017 takes place at Carnival City on Saturday. The main event of EFC57 at the Big Top Arena sees an undefeated champion putting his title on the line against the man he took it from almost a year ago. Igeu &#8220;Smiley&#8221; Kabesa has been unstoppable in the organisation and boasts a perfect 8-0 record with one successful title defence. But the local favourite will not have things his own way when he takes a dangerous Scot in the form of Danny Henry. Henry relinquished his title to Kabesa in March last year after being on the wrong end of a unanimous decision on the judge&#8217;s cards after a hard-fought five rounds. &#8220;I have already choked someone out and now it&#8217;s time for me to knock someone out,&#8221; Kabesa chuckled. But, Henry insists he has learnt from his mistakes and the result will be different this time round. &#8220;I don&#8217;t stress about pressure&#8230; pressure is for tyres.&#8221; &#8220;Last time I never really got going. Kabesa has a very negative style and is difficult to counter. I have to be much more disciplined,&#8221; Henry said. The co-main event tonight will see the big men of the organisation going at it for the right to compete for the heavyweight title. Elvis Moyo and Michael Vermeulen are arguably two of the standout fighters in the division and the winner looks almost certain to get a crack at champion Andrew van Zyl. The remaining fights on the main card will be a case of national pride as three local favourites will test their skills against European opposition. South Africa&#8217;s most experienced MMA fight, Martin van Staden, will be looking to make life difficult for EFC debutant Christian Holley of England. Heavyweight Wessel Mostert will be out to keep his perfect record intact when he locks horns with British powerhouse Tony Mustard. Gordon Roodman will open the main card proceedings when he takes on rising Bulgarian Georgi Georgiev. The main cards bouts will be live on SABC3 from 9pm on Saturday.
