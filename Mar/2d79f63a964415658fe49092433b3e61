Australia captain Steve Smith faced calls for disciplinary action Wednesday after a row over alleged cheating overshadowed the second Test against India, with his predecessor Michael Clarke accusing him of &#8220;unacceptable&#8221; behaviour. India&#8217;s dramatic, 75-run victory on Tuesday in Bangalore, after Australia crashed to 112 all out, has left the four-match series between the world&#8217;s top two sides tantalisingly poised at 1-1. But Wednesday&#8217;s headlines were dominated by Indian skipper Virat Kohli&#8217;s accusation that Smith abused the decision review system (DRS), after he was seen looking to the Australian dressing-room while considering appealing against his dismissal for LBW. The game&#8217;s rules forbid players to consult with anyone off the pitch about whether to seek a review from the umpires, particularly as support staff have access to television replays in the dressing-room. At the post-match press conference, Smith &#8211; who was quickly waved off the field by the umpire &#8211; admitted he had been at fault, but put it down to a one-off &#8220;brain fade&#8221;. But an angry Kohli said it wasn&#8217;t an isolated incident and &#8220;that it&#8217;s been happening for the last three days, and it has to stop&#8221;. Although Kohli stopped short of accusing Smith of being a cheat, Indian newspapers were less diplomatic. &#8220;Smith Caught Cheating,&#8221; an Indian Express headline said. Smith&#8217;s explanation was met with widespread scepticism with even Clarke doubting whether it was a one-off, given the non-striker Peter Handscomb seemed to suggest he consult the dressing-room. &#8220;If what Virat Kohli is saying is true and Australia are using their support staff to help them decide on a DRS decision then that&#8217;s not on, that&#8217;s unacceptable,&#8221; Clarke told the India Today network. &#8220;I think Steve Smith respects the game and will always uphold the integrity of the game and if it is just a one-off then it is a brain-fade and he&#8217;s made a mistake. &#8220;My concern, my worry is, that when you look at the footage at what happened, Peter Handscomb &#8230; actually suggests to Steve Smith to turn around and have a look to the support staff. &#8220;Now if it is only a one-off, I don&#8217;t think that would have happened.&#8221; Although no formal complaint has been lodged with the International Cricket Council (ICC), a source in the Indian board said that the team would press for charges. The record-breaking Indian batsman Sunil Gavaskar said the ICC should punish Smith for a &#8220;quite blatant&#8221; breach of the rules. Another Indian batting great, VVS Laxman, tweeted that the Australian&#8217;s actions were &#8220;totally against the spirit of the game&#8221; and the former Indian skipper Sourav Ganguly said officials must ensure there was no repeat.
