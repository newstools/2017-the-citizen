The Proteas and New Zealand&#8217;s captains both claimed to have gained a psychological edge after rain washed out the final day of the first Test in Dunedin on Sunday. Despite New Zealand suffering the loss of batsman Ross Taylor for the second Test, captain Kane Williamson felt buoyed by the his side being able to establish a 33-run first innings lead.

Pace bowler Matt Henry has also been added to the squad with Trent Boult nursing a leg injury. South African captain Faf du Plessis felt the rain had ruined a potential victory, with the Proteas set to capitalise on New Zealand&#8217;s injury woes. &#8220;When a Test match finishes on a day like today it&#8217;s very frustrating,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If today was a full day of cricket, we felt with New Zealand one seamer down and one of their main batters out of the team we fancied our chances. It&#8217;s very disappointing from that point of view. &#8220;We were 190 ahead on a wicket that was spinning quite a bit, purely on the match position if we got 50-60 more runs, a 250 lead and set them that in 50-60 overs, we&#8217;d fancy our chances.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
