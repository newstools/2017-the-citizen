Taking the side of the Afrikaans language pressure group AfriSake considered in many quarters a forum for entrenching elitism and against the broader concerns of this country is not a stance this publication takes lightly. But in warning Julius Malema, the self-styled commander-in-chief of the EFF, against recent calls to expropriate land without the due consultations and compensation entrenched in the constitution, or face contempt of court charges, AfriForum has got it right. AfriSake obtained an order in the North Gauteng High Court interdicting Malema from repeating some of his inflammatory outpourings on the touchy subject of land and its distribution, granting costs against the EFF and its party leader. EFF legal officer Zuma Madibane had told the court it would not take instructions from organisations representing a racial minority obsessed with preserving white supremacist ideas and would not stop until all land had been returned to its rightful owners . We would suggest that Malema, Madibane and the EFF as a whole study the judgment and the constitution. As a political party, they cannot plead ignorance of either. To do so would only invite anarchy and a flood of court cases, which would inevitably inflame racial tensions. For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
