Sharks coach Robert du Preez believes his team will need more discipline, territory and execution if they are going to beat the Brumbies on Saturday in Canberra in their second Super Rugby match of the new season. Those were the three major areas of their game that went awry when they went down 28-26 to the Reds in Brisbane. Also read: Explained: Is rugby in the Eastern Cape being rescued? We didn t play well at all, it was a very disappointing result and we just couldn t get going at all. We didn t have a lot of possession and you need a fair share of possession if you re going to win. The first problem was our discipline, we gave away 11 penalties . So discipline is a focus this week. And territory goes hand-in-hand with possession and our exits weren t great. And we also couldn t fit phases together because of individual errors. We need to be able to execute three phases after the set-piece, because then you re in the mix and you can play rugby, Du Preez said. On the positive side for the Sharks, however, was that they still had a chance of winning the game right to the death, while halfbacks Cobus Reinach and Pat Lambie had valuable game time as they look to stay fit for the whole season. The one good aspect is that we could still have pulled the game from the fire in the last couple of minutes. And I was happy with both Cobus and Pat, they will just get better with more match practice. Cobus had 65 to 70 minutes and Pat played the full game, which was fantastic. They will just get sharper with every game, Du Preez said. There will be one definite change to the Sharks team with lock Etienne Oosthuizen suspended for the Brumbies match a game he had apparently been really looking forward to against a side he gained three caps for in 2013 due to a two-week ban for striking a Reds player. Du Preez added, however, that he was mulling one or two other changes. For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
