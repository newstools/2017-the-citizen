In what position should AB de Villiers be batting? The longer the Proteas one-day skipper keeps playing, the more it becomes clear that this question will probably never be answered. It&#8217;s again one of the main talking points going into Saturday&#8217;s decider in the ODI series against New Zealand in Auckland. Also read: Can the Proteas middle order please stand up? De Villiers has been superb to date, smashing 239 runs in four innings and only being dismissed twice. However, as Wednesday&#8217;s loss in Hamilton illustrated, it&#8217;s important to note in what position he made those runs. De Villiers came in at No 5 and scored an unbeaten 72 off 59 balls. You should probably marvel at how well he played but instead, one wonders what could&#8217;ve happened if he came in at No 4 and had more time? Faf du Plessis, De Villiers&#8217; deputy in the 50-over side, is well aware of the issue. &#8220;AB normally bats at No 4,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Bar one or two games in this series where he&#8217;s batted at 5, that&#8217;s his position. Normally when he comes in at No 4 and has time to score a century, we&#8217;re on the front foot and perhaps even over the line.&#8221; The problem in this series though is that the Proteas batting would&#8217;ve sunk without him as he&#8217;s been responsible for repairing the damage left by an underperforming top-order. &#8220;When you&#8217;re playing on a tougher wicket, it&#8217;s probably nice to have his experience at hand,&#8221; said Du Plessis. &#8220;It&#8217;s valuable having him to guide the rookie all-rounders at the death. They influence each other positively.&#8221; That sums up the dilemma for the Proteas. Of course, that headache could be relieved if someone like JP Duminy came to the party. The left-hander, together with David Miller, has not been in great form. But Du Plessis believes those indiscretions can be forgiven if Duminy delivers in a must-win game. &#8220;JP just needs to go out and play the way we want him to play &#8211; with freedom,&#8221; he said. &#8220;He&#8217;s at his best when he&#8217;s encouraged to be dominant. It&#8217;s been a dry series for him in terms of converting starts but it&#8217;s also promising in a way.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
