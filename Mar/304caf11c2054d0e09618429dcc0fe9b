The seasonally adjusted Absa Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), an indicator of the economic health of the manufacturing sector, saw the rate of improvement in the sector s operating conditions gaining momentum in February. According to the index released on Wednesday, the PMI gauge rose by a further 1.6 points to 52.5 index points in February, a highest reading in seven months, after a 4.2-point rise in January. Absa said the second consecutive improvement in the PMI and the broad-based nature of the uptick across the key subcomponents was a positive sign that the manufacturing sector started the year on a solid footing. The PMI is based on five major indicators: new orders, inventory levels, production, supplier deliveries and the employment environment. The purpose of the PMI is to provide information about current business conditions to company decision makers, analysts and purchasing managers. The PMI showed that both production and new sales orders continued to expand in February but at an accelerated pace. According to the survey report, the rise in new sales orders was a function of increased export orders with the recovery in the local agricultural sector also likely lifting demand for manufactured products. Commenting on the PMI, Investec said this signalled that actual manufacturing production rebounded in the first quarter of 2017 from the 4.3 percent quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised contraction in the quarter of 2016.
