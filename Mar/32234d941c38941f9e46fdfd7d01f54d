A crazed and aggressive dog that was foaming at the mouth and suspected to have rabies was put down early this morning by a local vet in Ladysmith, KwaZulu-Natal. The neglected crossbreed dog was female and was unable to stand up properly. However, when approached, it would snarl and lunge, Ladysmith Gazette reported. The Animal Anti-Cruelty League (AACL) received a complaint from a resident of Van Riebeeck Park on Saturday morning about an aggressive dog in the area. League workers immediately went out to investigate. Annamarie Koen of the AACL was heartbroken when they arrived and found the dog in a terrible state. It was foaming from the mouth and could not stand properly. Due to its aggression, a catchpole had to be used to capture the dog. It was immediately taken to the kennels on the N11. They tried feeding and giving the dog water, but she refused to eat or drink throughout the weekend (a clear sign of textbook rabies). Annamarie said the dog was very aggressive, and they had to isolate her from the other animals at the kennels. The league is waiting patiently for the test results to see if the dog had rabies or not. It is really sad to see an animal suffering like this. Pet owners need to make sure that their animals are well looked after, says Annamarie. &#8211; Caxton News Service For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter .
