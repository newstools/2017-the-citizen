The Competition Commission on Friday said it extended its search and seizure operation involving six fresh produce market agents allegedly involved in cartel conduct raids of premises in Cape Town and Durban. This follows a search and seizure operation carried out at nine fruit and veg agents in Pretoria and Johannesburg fresh produce markets in Gauteng on Thursday. In Cape Town, the Commission raided the premises of Subtropico, RSA Group, and Fine Bros at 9am in the morning. In Durban, the Commission also executed a search and seizure warrant at premises of RSA Group, Wenpro KZN, and Delta Market Agents. The search and seizure operations are part of an investigation into alleged cartel conduct which was reported by the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. The agents, which serve as intermediaries between farmers and buyers of freshly produced fruits and vegetables in South Africa, are suspected of being involved in cartel conduct in contravention of the Competition Act. The Commission has said it reasonable grounds to believe that the agents entered into an agreement and/or engaged in a concerted practice to fix the price and trading conditions for the supply of freshly produced fruits and vegetables in South Africa. This conduct is alleged to be ongoing and is in contravention of the provisions of section 4 of the Competition Act. Commissioner Tembinkosi Bonakele said the commission was concerned with the prevalence of collusion in the food sector as higher prices of these commodities affect the most vulnerable households.
