It&#8217;s just a matter of time before Mbuyiseni Ndlozi and rumoured bae Mmabatho Montsho come out and confirm their relationship to the world and end all our misery. The People&#8217;s Bae has shared a few snaps of each other, with messages of encouragement and congratulations, without saying anything to confirm they are a couple that is if calling her WCW (woman crush wednesday) is not all the proof we need. On Thursday afternoon, Ndlozi took to Instagram to share Montsho&#8217;s picture and said he had read a &#8220;great&#8221; film script written by her. &#8220;Recently I read a great film script about a story of shoes and blackness written by my favorite Storyteller @montshotheblack. Watch the space!&#8221; The People&#8217;s Bae seems to be very supportive of her, and even when she was shooting the movie, Happiness is a Four Letter Word, he shared snaps of her and talked about the movie. Recently, while shooting, she shared a video of herself with her colleague and received a phone call from someone she calls &#8220;boo boo&#8221;. Fans were left wondering if boo boo was the People&#8217;s Bae. Watch the video below: A post shared by Mmabatho Montsho (@montshotheblack) on Jan 26, 2017 at 12:09am PST Montsho has also shared snaps of him, once calling him her Monday motivation. All we really want is for the EFF national spokesperson and Montsho to come out and just end our misery.
