A case of fraud has been opened against Stella Buthelezi, a wealthy Joburg businesswoman. Buthelezi is understood to have lured Tau into giving her R2 million for a bogus business venture last year. Tau invested the money with her, expecting to receive a share certificate but was surprised when Buthelezi starting ignoring his calls and messages, Sunday World reports. &#8220;The complainant transferred the amount of R2 million into an account which belongs to the Buthelezi family,&#8221; a statement of the case read. In response to Tau&#8217;s case, Buthelezi said Tau had no interest in following up on the financial affairs of the company he had invested in. She said he had failed to prove any money was due to him as no agreements had been reached regarding the company. &#8220;Mr Tau did not attempt to follow due processes and procedures when demanding that the R2 million be repaid to him,&#8221; said Buthelezi.
