Dingaan Thobela&#8217;s girlfriend, Sana Ncwane, has accused the former boxing champion of physically abusing her. Ncwane has now reportedly kicked Thobela out of her apartment after allegedly having a fight in which he hit her. In retaliation, Thobela allegedly confiscated Ncwane&#8217;s house keys. After many attempts to get him to return the keys, Thobela reportedly promised to return the keys this week after being told he would be a suspect should there be a break-in at the house. Ncwane&#8217;s friend, who reportedly spoke to Sunday World, said Ncwane had been keeping quiet about the fights to protect his reputation, but was now tired of him because he refused to give her keys back. Ncwane has confirmed the breakup to the publication and that the &#8216;Rose of Soweto&#8217; had taken her keys. Though Thobela also confirmed the breakup and reportedly told the publication Ncwane had cheated on him. She would talk to different men in his presence, claiming they were her friends, but would throw tantrums whenever he spoke to the mothers of his children, he further alleged. He, however, denied allegations he used to physically abuse her, further saying he had misplaced them. &nbsp; &nbsp;
