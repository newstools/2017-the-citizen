So excited was Cassper to debut his music video for Tito Mboweni that he did a premature happy dance. #TitoMboweniVideo dropping tomorrow morning at 9am!!!! Shout out to all 3000 of u who liked the tweet!!! Dis my mood ryt now!!! Sha Sha!!! pic.twitter.com/sLIlfISRRA &mdash; Abuti Fill Up (@CassperNyovest) March 29, 2017 It wasn&#8217;t that the visuals were lacking; in fact far from it, as the video features Queen Twerk, a social media queen who trended last year after a video of her and her boyfriend in an intimate moment went viral. He also roped in his squad, Nadia Nakai, Carpo More and Riky Rick. Against a backdrop of flashy cars, a mansion and expensive booze, the &#8216;Tito Mboweni&#8217; video scores high on what&#8217;s cool right now. But Cassper probably didn&#8217;t anticipate that Twitter would love the video, but on mute. I was about to tweet this but for real #TitoMbowenivideo is dope when the sound is on mute https://t.co/MHQfNVvYEi &mdash; L U T H O (@Lutho__m) March 30, 2017 When you watch #TitoMboweniVideo with mute or 0 volume. &mdash; Ungovernable (@Katlego_Bortes) March 30, 2017 The highlight though is that iFani gave the video a big thumbs up. iFani slated the song, saying it was trash and that people should rather download &#8216;Hell Naw&#8217; by Nasty C, implying Cassper didn&#8217;t do real hip-hop. He has since tweeted that he is eating humble pie, as the video is too hot for words. @iFani_Haymani &#39;s reaction to #TitoMboweniVideo pic.twitter.com/iobAmmuKve &mdash; Mondly Shezi (@_Mondly) March 30, 2017 I didn&#39;t like the track. not sure about the music video #TitoMboweniVideo &mdash; Sandiso Mabena (@NguShoza) March 30, 2017 #TitoMboweniVideo so lit visuals are in another Level @CassperNyovest @familytreeworld &mdash; Lindelani (@Lindelani15) March 30, 2017 #TitoMboweniVideo dope video.well done @CassperNyovest &mdash; lesego S (@lesegoMo2a) March 30, 2017 ALSO READ: Cassper&#8217;s &#8216;Tito Mboweni&#8217; is trash, rather download &#8216;Hell Naw&#8217; iFani For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
