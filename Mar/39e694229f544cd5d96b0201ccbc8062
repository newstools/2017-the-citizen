Champion trainer Sean Tarry continues to churn out winners and has built up a substantial enough lead on this year s log to indicate he is well on his way to earn his third successive title. Runners from the stable always look superb and they run accordingly, so when you have a Tarry-trained runner who is well handicapped and course-and-distance suited, it is worth including in all bets. In Other Words lines up in Race 5 at Greyville on Wednesday, a Pinnacle Stakes for fillies and mares over 1400m on the Polytrack. This daughter of Trippi is coming off a 96-day break but she has so many other things going for her that she has to be the runner they all have to beat. Her record over the track and trip reads four runs, three wins and a fourth place. That last run came in the River Indigo Handicap (Non-Black Type) in which she carried 62kg and had to give weight to all the other runners, including 7kg to winner Strategic Move. In this race she is at least 2kg better handicapped than any of the other runners. She also has the benefit of Anthony Delpech in the irons who along with Anton Marcus, is the leading rider on the Polytrack. The main threat should come from Pearl Emblem who finished in front of In Other Words in the race won by Strategic Move and thanks to the apprentice allowance of Diego de Gouveia, they will meet at the same weight difference on this occasion. However, in that race Pearl Emblem was allowed to set a sedate pace and might not have the same luxury this time. A Womens Way has decent form and has run second in her only race at this course but Duncan Howell s charge needs to prove she will stay 1400m.
