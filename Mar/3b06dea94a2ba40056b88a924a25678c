The rate at which he takes wickets makes him seem like he&#8217;s the indisputable leader of the Proteas pace attack. But Kagiso Rabada doesn&#8217;t consider himself that. Instead, the brilliant 21-year-old quick is enjoying a journey where him and the rest of his rookie teammates are growing together. &#8220;We boast a new bowling attack. There&#8217;s not much experience,&#8221; said Rabada, who on Saturday led South Africa to 3-2 ODI series win over New Zealand with a fine spell of 3/25. &#8220;It&#8217;s really nice that we&#8217;re going through all our trials and successes together. Hopefully all of us stay in the team. And if someone new comes in, we can hopefully help them adapt quickly too.&#8221; Rabada ended as South Africa&#8217;s leading wicket-taker with 8 in the series yet it was notable that the scalps were actually well spread between the bowlers. Imran Tahir took 6, Dwaine Pretorius and Chris Morris 5 each and Andile Phelukwayo chipped in with 4. That&#8217;s the type of dynamic any good one-day side needs. It hasn&#8217;t been easy though.

Wickets these days can be quite batter-friendly but we&#8217;ve got an experienced bowling coach in Charl Langeveldt. I also feel we learn quite quickly, that&#8217;s one of our strengths,&#8221; said Rabada. With a three-match Test series commencing on Wednesday in Dunedin, the New Zealanders now have the headache of facing a Rabada who&#8217;s keen to apply some of the fundamentals of ODI cricket in the five-day format too. It&#8217;s a bit of a scary thought. &#8220;One-day cricket requires a lot of skill. There are so many plans you can come up with and implement,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You can bowl wide yorkers, slower ball bouncers, back-of-the-hand slower balls and yorkers upfront. In Test cricket, you don&#8217;t have all those considerations. &#8220;It&#8217;s less of a headache. Test cricket is more about perseverance and patience, it can drain you mentally. But we&#8217;ve seen bowlers who carry over plans from white-ball cricket to Test cricket. Who knows? I could surprise a few batters.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
