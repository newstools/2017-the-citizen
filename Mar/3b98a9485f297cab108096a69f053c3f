There is strong evidence suggesting that investing in contraception saves lives of women, says Dr Flavia Bustreo, the Assistant Director-General of the World Health Organisation.On the eve of International Women s Day marked last week, Dr Bustreo attended the She Decides conference in Brussels where Ministers and other high-level participants reaffirmed their support for women s and girls ability to make decisions about their own lives including contraception.In her opinion piece published on the WHO website after the Brussels conference, Dr Bustreo noted that contraception contributes to gender equality and boosts economic development. If all women who want to avoid a pregnancy used modern contraceptives and all pregnant women and newborns received care at the standards recommended by WHO unintended pregnancies would reduce by an estimated 70 per cent, she wrote. Abortions (would reduce) by 67 per cent, maternal deaths by 67 per cent and newborn deaths by 77 per cent (compared to 2014), she noted further. On International Women s Day, we must all unequivocally reaffirm our commitment to women s and girls fundamental rights, she remarked.She pointed out the investment opportunities that could be obtained from venturing in contraception. She said, Every $1 invested in modern contraception and good quality care for pregnant women and newborns returns an estimated $120. However, she said, This is about more than sexual and reproductive health and rights. It is about women s and girls ability to make decisions about their own bodies and their environment so they can improve their health, their futures and their lives.
