Wenger opted to leave star striker Sanchez on the bench for the first half at Anfield and the move failed miserably as Liverpool swept into a two-goal lead. The Gunners boss sent on Sanchez at half-time and the Chilean immediately provided the assist as Arsenal&#8217;s Danny Welbeck reduced the deficit. It was too late to spark an Arsenal fightback however and Wenger&#8217;s side crashed out of the top four after a third defeat in their last four league games. Wenger conceded the Sanchez decision had proved a mistake, but he also turned the blame on his players. &#8220;Yes (it did backfire), but I felt the strikers suffered in the first half and we didn&#8217;t dominate in the midfield. It is always debatable,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We had problems getting into the rhythm of the first half. We conceded cheap goals, direct balls from the goalkeeper and you do not expect that in a game like this. &#8220;We came back in the second half, responded well, but didn&#8217;t perform at our level in the first half.&#8221; Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp was delighted by a commanding display that erased the memory of Monday&#8217;s lacklustre 3-1 loss at Leicester and lifted his team into third place. &#8220;It was one of the best games we have played so far because of the strength of the opponent,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We did really well. We had hard words after the defeat at Leicester. We analysed it and that wasn&#8217;t enjoyable. &#8220;We had another opportunity and we took it today. All of them played a fantastic game. It&#8217;s the roller coaster of the Premier League.&#8221;
