Former ANC treasurer-general Mathews Phosa is receiving prayers from a church to help him on his race to become the ANC&#8217;s next president. In a video shared by Zwelinzima Vavi, the &#8220;future president&#8221; can be seen sitting on a chair as pastors of the church surround him to pray for him to become SA&#8217;s next big leader. In isiXhosa, the pastor says: &#8220;We have a president who will take over and we have faith that it will happen. But before we pray for Mathews, that tells me that Zoleka, my niece, yearns to be here next to him, so that, after we have prayed, he has some words to say to this child.&#8221; He then calls Zoleka to come and sit next to Phosa. &#8220;For this office we will do everything I mean everything,&#8221; said Vavi of the video.

Branch chairperson Boy Mamabolo said Phosa was lobbying his branch to support him. We are open to discussions, Mamabolo said. We will support anyone who is suitable to lead the ANC. The move by the Milo Malatji branch is seen as a blow to Cyril Ramaphosa and his supporters in the province, who formed the CR17 lobby group with the sole aim of lobbying for Ramaphosa. Phosa, Ramaphosa, Minister in the Presidency Jeff Radebe, National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete and former African Union Commission chairperson Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma are all already in the race for the job.
