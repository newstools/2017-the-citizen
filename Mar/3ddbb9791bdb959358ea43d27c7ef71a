Singer Skolopad performed for crowds at a bash held in former SABC boss Hlaudi Motsoeneng&#8217;s honour. The Maluti-A-Phofung municipality in the Free State threw a homecoming concert for former SABC chief financial officer Hlaudi Motsoeneng in Phuthaditjhaba, with music stars such as Rebecca Malope and Dr Malinga performing. Skolopad took to Twitter to share her joy that gospel star Rebecca had performed before, effectively &#8220;opening&#8221; for her. Skolopad also shared an image of herself and Motsoeneng looking cosy. She is from the Free State, and it is likely she was chosen to perform because of that. I was born in QwaQwa, and I was raised there, too. I completed my tertiary studies in nursing in Ladysmith then I moved to Bethlehem, in the Free State, where I m currently based. I work as a nurse at a particular hospital, and I ve been there for eight years now, she said in an interview last month.
