After reports that a woman in a taxi on Ontdekkers Road was held at gunpoint by three men who allegedly raped her and withdrew money from her bank account, at least seven other victims with similar stories have emerged. This is according to Gauteng MEC for Community Safety Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane, who reacted with shock to the report about the Johannesburg woman, who was allegedly raped inside the minibus taxi in front of her 10-year-old son on Sunday. On Thursday, Nkosi-Malobane held a meeting with taxi associations in Johannesburg where she called on taxi drivers to respect and protect female commuters. The woman s harrowing ordeal has exposed several other cases of woman in the province who have also been raped after being picked up by men in minibus taxis. Nkosi-Malobane urged women who have been sexually assaulted by taxi drivers to come forward and report the crimes against them. She said her department knew the taxi and the picture of one of the perpetrators involved in the incidents. However, she issued an ultimatum to taxi drivers to point out the rapists among them. But I still want to give the taxi associations and leadership the benefit of the doubt and say to you guys, hand over before the end of the day [Thursday] those perpetrators to us, she said. Gauteng police reportedly said they were examining CCTV footage from ATMs and following up leads as they investigated the rapes of the women. Police spokesperson Lungelo Dlamini said they were searching for the suspects after no arrests were made in all the cases reported. The MEC said she was disappointed that incidents of women being picked up by men in minibus taxis and getting raped were happening for some time. Taxi leadership is not surprised that women are being raped in taxis. They claim that police are aware that women have been victims of rape and no one has done anything about it, she said.
