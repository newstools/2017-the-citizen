Entrants have been warned of potential gale-force winds on Sunday, with riders expected to battle rough conditions at the annual Cape Town Cycle Tour road race. &#8220;We have been advised that there is a high probability of severe winds on the Cape Peninsula within the next 24 hours,&#8221; organisers said in a statement on Saturday. &#8220;We strongly urge Cape Town Cycle Tour participants who are either not comfortable or do not have experience riding in strong winds, to carefully consider their decision to participate. &#8220;We believe wind conditions will not be as strong as in 2009, but they will nevertheless be severe.&#8221; At the 2009 edition of the race, participants faced winds of up to 60km/h, which knocked riders off their bikes and forced organisers to extend the cut-off time at the finish. According to the SA Weather Service, there was an 85% chance of rain on Sunday morning, and though it was expected to clear up later in the day, wind speeds could approach 50km/h in the afternoon. Over 35 000 riders had entered the annual race, organisers confirmed, with mass participants and elite men tackling the traditional 109km distance, and elite women contesting a separate 76km race.
