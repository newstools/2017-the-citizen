Watson and co&#8217;s arrests are related to the misuse and laundering of up to R200 million from the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality&#8217;s Integrated Public Transport System (IPTS) budget. The EPRU has been in dire straits since the end of 2015 and was eventually liquidated in August last year. The Nelson Mandela Bay Ratepayers&#8217; Association had been the initial party to shine a light on the EPRU&#8217;s affairs by claiming the union had been using ratepayers&#8217; money to the tune of R120 million over the four years since the Kings were first confirmed as Super Rugby participants in 2012. Watson and his co-accused are already at the Port Elizabeth Magistrate&#8217;s Court awaiting their preliminary hearing. For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
