The Nelson Mandela Bay municipality and the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (Hawks) are hot on the heels of alleged fraudsters luring unsuspecting businesses to pay thousands of rand for false tender documentation, according to the city. After municipal officials became aware of the scam it was reported to the ethics hotline and attempts were being made to trace the culprits, municipal spokesman Kupido Baron said in a statement. Residents must note that official municipal tenders are advertised on our website at www.nelsonmandelabay.gov.za and published on Wednesdays in leading local newspapers. The amount payable for tender documents is never more than R200 and definitely not the R5500 requested by the fraudsters. The fake tender invitation document could be viewed on: http://www.nelsonmandelabay.gov.za/DataRepository/Documents/new-tender-scam.pdf Members of the public were requested to kindly ignore the fake document and to alert their fellow businessmen and women regarding the scam, he said.
