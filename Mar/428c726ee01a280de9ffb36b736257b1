Crime intelligence information has resulted in the arrest of a 33-year-old man for the murder of a security officer who was fatally shot at the Twin City Mall in Heidedal, Bloemfontein, on March 4, Free State police said on Sunday. The security officer was killed in a failed robbery incident at about [8.30am] when he was shot at the back of the head after collecting cash from one of the stores at the mall, Colonel Thandi Mbambo said. The suspect allegedly pounced on him from behind and fatally shot him in the head while he was walking towards the cash-in-transit vehicle that was waiting for him at the mall s entrance. The suspect then fled empty-handed to the getaway car with GP [Gauteng] registration [plates] that was waiting in the parking bay in the mall. The case was handed over to the provincial task team who made a breakthrough on Thursday when they arrested the suspect at his home in Rocklands, Mangaung. He would appear in the Bloemfontein Magistrate s Court on Monday on a charge of murder, Mbambo said. African News Agency (ANA) For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
