Alli, 20, received a straight red card for his horror tackle on Gent&#8217;s Brecht Dejaegere during the Premier League club&#8217;s shock Europa League exit. Alli speared his right foot high into Dejaegere&#8217;s shin. The Belgian midfielder was able to continue initially but had to be substituted, limping off with a bloodied shin. Alli will miss the first three games of next season&#8217;s Champions League if Spurs qualify for the tournament again. Gent earned a 2-2 draw and 3-2 win on aggregate in the last 32 tie.
