Rescue operations to save Richard Thole have ceased after Ekurhuleni&#8217;s emergency services couldn&#8217;t send anyone down the mine shaft without endangering another life. According to Times LIVE, Ekurhuleni mayor Mzwandile Masina has now called on the army to send its experts to assist with helping retrieve Thole. &#8220;We are dreading the eventuality of the likely outcome &#8221; said Masina. CEO of Mine Rescue Services Christo de Klerk said: &#8220;It will not be possible to continue without endangering the life of any person.&#8221; Mine rescue services were then called to the scene to assist and, for days, rescue workers have been working to rescue the boy, but the unstable ground in the shaft, gases and depth posed challenges to their efforts. Ntladi said the water level was at 140m. On Wednesday morning, Jerusalem informal settlement community members resumed their post looking on as rescue workers set to work sending the camera on a specialised dolly down the opening of the shaft again, after the excavation was completed. Mine rescue technicians lower the camera into the shaft on Tuesday. Ekurhuleni MMC for community safety Vivian Chauke returned to the site on Wednesday morning and was briefed by the rescue services on the progress.
