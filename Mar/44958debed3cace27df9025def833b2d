The abuse of illegal substances is one of the main contributing factors to fuelling crimes against women and children. The Philippi East SAPS [South African Police Service] management believe that if they can combat the abuse of illegal substances they will be able to address and reduce property-related and contact crimes effectively. A focused approach, including going back to basics to ensure the community is reached and building partnerships to ensure trust, will ensure that quality service delivery takes place and crime is reduced. Anyone with information regarding illegal drugs is kindly requested to contact Philippi East SAPS 021-370-1900 or Crime stop 08600-10111, Van Wyk said.
