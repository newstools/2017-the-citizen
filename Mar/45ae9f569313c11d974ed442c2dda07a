In the build-up to the first weekend of Super Rugby, Cheetahs coach Franco Smith was adamant he didn&#8217;t want to discuss his side&#8217;s depth. For too many years, that issue was used as an excuse for the central franchise underperforming. Also read: Johannes Jonker: The Lions bargain buy bought off TV But a freakish number of injuries within the first two weeks of this year&#8217;s campaign will test Smith&#8217;s resolve. On Thursday, the Cheetahs mentor had to include scrumhalf Zee Mkhabela on the right wing for Saturday&#8217;s meeting with the Sunwolves in Bloemfontein. It&#8217;s a perfect illustration of the injury crisis. Four of Smith&#8217;s frontline centres &#8211; Francois Venter (ankle), Nico Lee (shoulder), William Small-Smith (finger) and Mikey van der Spuy (concussion) &#8211; are on the sidelines, meaning veteran Rayno Benjamin had to shift from wing. Some might then say it&#8217;s fortunate that the Cheetahs play the minnows with all their injuries but Smith doesn&#8217;t think so. &#8220;We measure ourselves weekly. It&#8217;s not about who we play, it&#8217;s how we compare from the previous week,&#8221; he said. ** The Stormers have the same problem as they are on their third different centre combination in three weeks. Daniel du Plessis, son of former Springbok Michael, will be EW Viljoen&#8217;s partner against the Kings in Port Elizabeth on Saturday. He&#8217;ll slot in after the Capetonians lost Juan de Jongh and Damian de Allende to injury, while Huw Jones is still on international duty. At least the Stormers don&#8217;t have to pick players out of position, with the experienced Bjorn Basson replacing the crocked Cheslin Kolbe at wing. Regular skipper Siya Kolisi is rested and there&#8217;ll be a new front row on duty. ** The Stormers&#8217; opponents and neighbours, ironically enough, also mixed and matched their centre combination. At least Kings coach Deon Davids admitted it was nothing more than rotation. &#8220;The guys understand that they have to grab their opportunities with both hands. It s all about performing in the Kings jersey,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I ve rotated Luzuko Vulindlu and Berton Klaasen for our centre combination. I feel that Waylon Murray, with this experience, at No13 will be good for us.&#8221; Maybe things are looking less gloomier for the franchise &#8211; rotation is not really a luxury they&#8217;ve had before.
