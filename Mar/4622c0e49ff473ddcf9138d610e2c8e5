African National Congress (ANC) MP Brian Molefe will reportedly be appointed South Africa s next finance minister, according to Business Report. The financial daily reported on Monday that highly placed sources close to the matter said President Jacob Zuma would replace as many as nine ministers from his Cabinet. This follows Zuma decision earlier on Monday morning to order Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and his deputy, Mcebisi Jonas, to cancel their international investment roadshow to the UK and US immediately. The former Eskom CEO has been widely expected to replace Gordhan or Jonas after he was sworn in as a member of the National Assembly last month. Molefe was nominated by the North West ANC amid contradictions from two branches of the ruling party in Gauteng, which claimed he belonged to their local structures.
