Four horses have been supplemented into the R4-million Premier&#8217;s Champions Challenge (Grade 1) over 2000m at Turffontein on Champions Day, Saturday May 6. Nine feature races will be run at the meeting, with three other Grade 1 events carded, the SA Derby, the World Sports Betting Computaform Sprint and the SA Nursery. Legal Eagle is by far the highest-rated horse in the Champions Challenge entry, but that has not scared away Mike de Kock, KwaZulu-Natal-based Gareth van Zyl or Cape trainer Justin Snaith. Van Zyl has supplemented Celtic Captain, while Snaith has pencilled in It&#8217;s My Turn. Celtic Captain is a dual feature-race winner, while It&#8217;s My Turn won last year&#8217;s Investec Cape Derby and ran fourth in the Vodacom Durban July a few months later. De Kock has the other two supplementary nominations in Nother Russia and Jubilee Line. Tiger Ridge filly Nother Russia has won four of her eight starts, her biggest win coming last time out in the Grade 3 Acacia Handicap. Jubilee Line, who is returning from a layoff this Saturday at Turffontein, is a two-time winner who will have to improve to have any kind of chance in this race, which is run at set weights plus penalties for Grade 1 and 2 wins.
