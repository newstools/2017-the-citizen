In a scathing statement against labour federation Cosatu for calling for the axing of Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini, who&#8217;s also the ANC Women&#8217;s League (ANCWL) president, the league has called the federation irresponsible. League secretary-general Moekgo Matuba said the alliance partner was irresponsible to &#8220;make allegations that the Sassa-CPS matter smells of corruption but not lay any corruption charge to the law enforcement agencies&#8221;. Cosatu had criticised the SA Social Security Agency (Sassa) and Dlamini for their complete lack of a plan to ensure that social grants get paid come April 1. The illegally awarded contract of Cash Paymaster Solutions (CPS) is coming to an end. The league, however, accused Cosatu of having &#8220;abonded&#8221; their duties towards workers. &#8220;If Cosatu is prepared to lay criminal charges for CEO&#8217;s of companies involved in collusion, what stops them from laying charges on the alleged corruption on Sassa-CPS matter?&#8221; They said Cosatu leaders were grandstanding in the hope of getting government positions and advancing factional politics. &#8220;They are taking advantage of the current challenges the movement is facing and are driving wedges to position themselves for the coming ANC national elective conference 2017.&#8221; They asked the federation to get back to focusing on their mandate and advancing the cause of women in the workplace. &#8220;A healthy, strong, united, non-factional Cosatu is good for the ANC and its leagues. And it&#8217;s good for the working class of our country.&#8221; On Friday morning, Cosatu called the league arrogant and said it stood by its call. The Methodist Church of Southern Africa has also called for Dlamini to be fired.
