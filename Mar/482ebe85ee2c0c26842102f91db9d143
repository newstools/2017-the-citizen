A security guard in his mid 20s was killed in a failed robbery at a mall in Heidedal in Bloemfontein on Saturday, Free State police said. The guard was collecting cash from a shop at Twin City mall at about 8.30am when he was followed by one of the unknown suspects , Brigadier Motantsi Makhele said. He had just collected the money from one of the stores in the mall when one suspect came from behind and allegedly shot at him at the back of the head. He was on his way to the cash-in-transit vehicle that was waiting for him at the mall s entrance. The guard fell onto the cash box and the perpetrator took off without touching the money . He was apparently joined by the second suspect who is suspected to have been waiting in the parking lot of the mall and they both ran into a getaway vehicle. It is a white double cab bakkie with unknown GP registration number, he said. Bloemfontein police had launched an intensive search for the suspects. We therefore appeal to anyone who might have some information on who the suspects might be to please come forward so that these suspects could be brought to book. Heidedal police could be contacted on 051-409-7213 or Crime Stop on 08600-10111, Makhele said. Free State police commissioner Lt-Gen Lebeoana Tsumane said: We will not rest until we have detected these ruthless perpetrators. It is so sickening to see innocent people dying in this way. We will definitely leave no stone unturned in our effort to bring those who were involved to justice, he said. African News Agency (ANA) Three dead in Mangaung retaliatory violence
