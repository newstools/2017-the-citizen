A Russian politician has proposed an unorthodox solution to the country s problems with football hooliganism before hosting the World Cup next year legalise it and make it a spectator sport. Organised groups of Russian fans fought English supporters on the streets of Marseille during Euro 2016. That inspired Igor Lebedev, who sits in the Russian parliament, to draw up rules for what he calls draka the Russian word for fight with 20 unarmed fighters on each side in an arena. In a statement on the website of the nationalist LDPR party, Lebedev said organised brawls &#8220;could turn fans aggression in a peaceful direction&#8221;. He also claimed it would serve as an &#8220;example&#8221; for English fans, who he characterised as undisciplined louts and poor fighters. &#8220;Russia would be a pioneer in a new sport,&#8221; said Lebedev, who also suggested fights between different fan groups could draw crowds of thousands. &#8220;English fans arrive, for example, and start picking fights. And they get the answer challenge accepted. A meeting in a stadium at a set time.&#8221; Some fan groups in Russia already hold illegal fights along similar lines, typically pre-arranged mass brawls in rural locations, away from police. It is not the first time Lebedev has courted controversy with his views on hooligans. He lauded the violence in Marseille last year, telling Russian fans: &#8220;Well done lads, keep it up!&#8221; In addition to his parliamentary duties as deputy speaker, Lebedev is on the board of the Russian Football Union. Despite his enthusiasm for football-related violence, Lebedev insisted that Russian policing meant foreign fans would not be in danger at the World Cup. &#8220;We ve taken all the safety measures, modernised legislation. Not a single tourist has any reason to fear travelling to our country in the summer of 2018.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
