A man was killed when he was hit by a bakkie on the N1 southbound between the Malibongwe and Beyers Naude turn-offs in Randburg, Johannesburg, on Saturday, ER24 paramedics said. ER24 paramedics, along with another service, arrived on the scene at about 7.45am to find the man, believed to be in his 30s, laying in the middle of the road, ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring said. Members of the public had already begun CPR [cardiopulmonary resuscitation] efforts. Paramedics immediately took over CPR as well as providing the patient with several advanced life support interventions. Unfortunately, after some time, no vital signs returned and the man was declared dead on the scene, he said. A bakkie was found on its side in the slow lane of the road. Paramedics assessed the driver and found that he had sustained only minor injuries. He was treated and thereafter transported to a nearby hospital. Local authorities were on the scene to investigate further, Meiring said. Later on Saturday afternoon, a 31-year-old man was seriously injured when he was knocked off his motorcycle by a car on Boy Louw Road in Steel Park in Vereeniging, Gauteng, paramedics said. ER24 paramedics arrived to find the biker lying on the embankment, while his motorbike was lying in pieces in the road, ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring said. Paramedics assessed the man and found that he had sustained serious injuries to his chest and both legs. He was treated and provided with several advanced life support interventions. Once treated, he was transported to Sebokeng Hospital for further treatment. The driver of the car was not injured. It was understood that the car had apparently turned in front of the motorbike, Meiring said. &nbsp; African News Agency (ANA)
