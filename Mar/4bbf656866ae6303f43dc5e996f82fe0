It seems Dr Malinga did not take the Metro FM Awards loss very well, as he is going on about what might have happened on the night. He went on a Twitter rant, throwing shade at Nasty C while also commenting on what is currently happening at Mabala Noise with Riky Rick. In a series of tweets, Malinga attacked the record label and said there was nothing they could do to get people to like them. He was referring to accusations that the record label bought the Metros after all its artists won in the category they were nominated in. He further called Nasty C a &#8220;pawn shop&#8221; that kept things owned by Mabala Noise. NASTY C IS LIKE PAWN SHOP KEEPING THINGS THAT DO NOT BELONG TO HIM LOL mabala noise. &mdash; #GOODWILL (@drmalinga) March 13, 2017 &#8220;Nasty C is like a pawn shop keeping things that do not belong to him, lol, Mabala Noise,&#8221; he said. The &#8216;Akulaleki&#8217; singer, who lost out to Nasty C for Song of the Year, has previously said he did not think the &#8216;Hell Naw&#8217; rapper did not deserve it. According to him, the songs, &#8216;Akulaleli&#8217;, &#8216;Wololo&#8217; (Babes Wodumo), &#8216;Mthande&#8217; (Musa), &#8216;Ngud&#8217; (Kwesta), &#8216;Amazulu&#8217; (Amanda Black), &#8216;Umsindo&#8217; (Durban&#8217;s Finest), &#8216;Ska Bhora Moreki&#8217; (King Monada), &#8216;Lion of Judah&#8217; (Lebo Sekgobela) and &#8216;Imali&#8217; (Black Motion) deserved the award. In fact, to prove his point, Malinga said he was contemplating buying an award for the Wololo star, Babes Wodumo. Thinking of going trophy shop and buy @babeswodumo an award for song of the year. &mdash; #GOODWILL (@drmalinga) March 13, 2017 After losing the award, Dr Malinga last week bought himself a Lingas Entertainment Song of the Year award and put it up for display.
