Six people were killed in a multiple vehicle crash on the N8 between Thaba Nchu and Botshabelo in the Free State in the early hours of Sunday morning, said the Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC). The crash involved five vehicles and reports indicated that two vehicles initially collided head-on, killing five people, TRMC spokesman Simon Zwane said. This set off a chain of events where three other vehicles got involved in crashes on the same scene. The third vehicle crashed drove through the scene and collided with the debris. The fourth vehicle slowed down to avoid the scene but the fifth vehicle could not stop and drove into the rear of the vehicle killing one person. The Road Traffic Management Corporation and the South African Police [Service] are investigating the cause of the crash, he said. However, the accident further highlighted the dangers inherent in driving in the early hours of the morning. An analysis of major crashes had shown these generally occurred towards midnight and in the early hours of the morning. Weekends were particularly dangerous days as most crashes occurred on Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday, Zwane said.
