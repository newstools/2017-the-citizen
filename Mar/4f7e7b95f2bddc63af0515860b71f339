A man was killed and two others were injured when a bakkie overturned on the Hansmoeskraal Road in Hansmoeskraal near George in the Western Cape on Saturday. ER24 paramedics, along with the metro services, arrived on the scene to find the bakkie on its side on the side of the road. Three men were found lying a short distance away from the vehicle, ER24 spokesman Russel Meiring said. Paramedics assessed the men and found that one had sustained numerous injuries and showed no signs of life. Unfortunately, the man had already succumbed to his injuries. Nothing could be done for the man and he was declared dead on the scene. The two other men were assessed. One sustained serious injuries while the other had sustained moderate injuries. Paramedics treated both men and provided the seriously injured man with advanced life support interventions. Once treated, the men were transported to a nearby hospital for further care. The cause of the accident would be investigated by the local authorities, Meiring said.
