It is no secret that Nkosinathi &#8216;Black Coffee&#8217; Maphumulo&#8217;s music career is soaring, and now he is the talk of the Twitter streets, having been trending since Sunday. A video of Coffee interacting with American rapper Diddy at his party on the weekend has been doing the rounds, and people have congratulated the DJ for reaching new heights.

Best part is him putting others on. Inspiration.&#8221; &#8220;Black Coffee and Trevor Noah, I just can&#8217;t help but smile that I am South African &amp; these guys are out there representing us with big foot prints.&#8221; &#8220;Someone said Black coffee used the stairs to get to the top and he&#8217;s now sending the elevator down for others.&#8221; &#8220;Black Coffee is partying with Diddy and the likes and I&#8217;m outchea looking forward to the next episode of Isibaya &#8211; see my life.&#8221; Even poet Ntsiki Mazwai had an opinion regarding Black Coffee&#8217;s success, asking who was backing him up. &#8220;Do you think black coffee is exceptional and extraordinarily talented or do you think he has white capital backing? Mazwai asked. While most said the question was unnecessary as the DJ worked hard for his success, he responded to Mazwai. He simply told Mazwai that even black people were smart enough to invest in themselves, saying next thing she would be saying he was using muti for success. @ntsikimazwai yhuuu Ntsiki&#8230;..next thing uzawuthi ndithwele&#8230;..we too black people have the brains to invest back in us. &mdash; #PIECESOFME (@RealBlackCoffee) March 26, 2017 Coffee last week opened up about his trip to the US last year, where he posted pictures of himself hanging out with the likes of rapper Sean &#8216;Diddy&#8217; Combs. Rumour at the time was that Diddy was working on a dance album, something that was not true, according to Coffee. No, I even assumed he wanted me for a dance album, but that s not the case. He s worked on his last hip-hop album. I finally sat down with him, and he was explaining to me the vision, like the sound he was trying to get.&#8221; Read more: Black Coffee opens up about working with P. Diddy, beef with AKA
