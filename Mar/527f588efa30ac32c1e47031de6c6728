A shepherd tending sheep and cattle stumbled across a newborn baby girl last week, Eastern Cape police said in a statement on Monday. Police spokesperson Captain Jackson Manatha said the abandoned baby was found alive on Wednesday last week at about 5pm at the Kwa Sotomela Location close to Walter Sisulu University in Butterworth. The shepherd alerted three high school students that he saw near the scene of the crime about the baby. The learners contacted Msobomvu Police Station. The baby was taken to Butterworth hospital where she is still being kept. Manatha said police were investigating, but nobody had been arrested yet. He urged anyone with information to contact Msobomvu Police on 047 492 0180.
