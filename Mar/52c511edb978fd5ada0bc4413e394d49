As Martin Guptill steered New Zealand to a seven-wicket victory in the fourth ODI against the Proteas on Wednesday with a magnificent unbeaten 180, one sequence stuck to one&#8217;s mind. It was the two sixes in succession he hit off Imran Tahir&#8217;s final over &#8211; a slog-sweep off a googly and straight smash from a fuller ball. Those hits messed up the leg-spinner&#8217;s figures (2/56) to such an extent that some are wondering if he&#8217;s lost his aura in this current ODI series. It&#8217;s not a nice thought given that the series is now tied at 2-all going into Saturday&#8217;s decider in Auckland. Also read: Proteas bow knee to brilliance of Martin Guptill Tahir, the No 1 ranked bowler in limited overs internationals, indeed hasn&#8217;t quite been firing as four wickets at an average of 45 and economy rate of almost six suggests. But AB de Villiers, the Proteas skipper, isn&#8217;t concerned. &#8220;All the New Zealand batters are doing is respecting Imran a bit more,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It happens when you have a match-winner in your ranks. The opposition tends to be more careful and work harder to try and play him well. &#8220;We do the same. You try and be cautious against one of two key bowlers and then try and attack the rest. I think New Zealand have a similar approach. They played him really well.&#8221; In a game where the Black Caps used two frontline spinners effectively, the Proteas might&#8217;ve rued only picking Tahir as tweaker. Yet De Villiers can&#8217;t dwell on something like that. &#8220;Guptill and co really just played well. I have no reason to believe it would&#8217;ve been different if there had been a second spinner present,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The pitch didn&#8217;t turn as much as we expected.&#8221; He&#8217;s hopeful Tahir will come into his own at the weekend. &#8220;Eden Park has a quicker pitch. Imran enjoys pitches like that, where the turn is quicker as well.&#8221; said De Villiers. &#8220;We saw in the T20 how effective he was. Quicker turn means he&#8217;s difficult to read. On a pitch like this one, you can misread him but because the pitch is slower there&#8217;s a window for adjusting.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
