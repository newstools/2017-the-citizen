Following President Jacob Zuma&#8217;s Cabinet reshuffle on Thursday, people took to social media to share their thoughts on the new portfolios some of the ministers have been moved to. Fikile Mbalula, who was minister of sports, has been moved to the police ministry, and, to some, this sounds like an April Fool&#8217;s Day joke. Even EFF leader Julius Malema during his press conference on Friday afternoon had an idea on how the new minister of police would run his ministry. According to Malema, Mbalula will have to do more to curb crime in this country, especially in Pretoria. He will have to leave behind all those glamorous activities he engaged in as the &#8220;Minister of Selfies&#8221;. Malema says if he doesn&#8217;t leave the glamour behind, he will end up calling Beyonce to come and perform for the police service. Razzmatazz has never hidden his love and admiration for Beyonce, once getting into trouble with poet Ntsiki Mazwai (and others) for having suggested that she perform during the 2010 World Cup opening concert. Mbalula has even tweeted Beyonce directly, congratulating her on whatever may be happening in her life. So the thought of him calling her to come and perform for the cops, using the police budget, is really not that far-fetched. @MbalulaFikile @Julius_S_Malema Mr &amp; Mrs SAPS &mdash; Lucky (@Lipra_LM) March 31, 2017 Some on Twitter also responded, adding what they thought Mbalula would do now that he was police minister. One of his followers said there would now not be a need to go to a police station to report a case, since people would just be able to &#8220;slide a DM&#8221; (direct message) to him on Twitter or Instagram. There were also suggestions that police uniforms might become far more stylish. Now that @MbalulaFikile is the Police Minister watch out for cheap Police uniforms #CabinetReshuffle pic.twitter.com/7SJvFPb50V &mdash; Joe Mabena (@MabenaJoe) March 31, 2017 Check out some of the reactions on Twitter: @MbalulaFikile change your profile to Minister of Police &amp; please tell cops not to harass us from now on the clubs will close at 5AM. &mdash; Mzwandile Sibinda (@djzwaii) March 31, 2017 @MbalulaFikile @Julius_S_Malema Mr Fikile u are the best unlike herbex Malema being broke makes him desperate n jealousy &mdash; Thabisodavid (@Thabisodavid20) March 31, 2017 @MbalulaFikile u must first arrest that criminal JZ783 then we can listen to u @Julius_S_Malema % correct &mdash; Cassius Mabunda (@CassiusMabunda) March 31, 2017 @MbalulaFikile @Julius_S_Malema dont bring beauty pageants to SAPS, or awards. coz we all know u were thinking it, remember SAPS party ran out of food &mdash; Matome (@_matmoh) March 31, 2017 @MbalulaFikile All SAPS members are happy to have you please work with them to fight this nyaope problem and weak criminal justice system &mdash; selaelo seleka (@selaelocom) March 31, 2017 Also read: Meet Mbalula&#8217;s match, South Sudan&#8217;s former minister of water and irrigation
