Kane put Tottenham two goals ahead at White Hart Lane with a first half screamer and a clinical second half effort. With 24 goals in 28 appearances this season, Kane&#8217;s purple patch has kept Tottenham in touch with Chelsea, who are seven points clear at the top before Monday&#8217;s visit to West Ham. Although Chelsea remain title favourites, Kane is still confident Spurs can make the final weeks of the season difficult for their London rivals. &#8220;We played very well today and controlled the game and then all of a sudden it was a nervy end,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s an important win, we should have won by more but it&#8217;s another step closer to the top of the table. &#8220;We want West Ham to win against Chelsea tomorrow, we don&#8217;t normally say that.&#8221; Tottenham&#8217;s ninth successive home win is a club record in the Premier League and the first time they have reached that mark in the same season since 1987. Kane&#8217;s only frustration was missing out on a fourth hat-trick in his last 10 appearances when a late shot was saved by Joel Robles &#8220;I wanted that third goal and I had chances which I should have scored. It would have been another match-ball but delighted with the win,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I feel sharp, fitter than ever so I need to keep it going. Every time I go out there I want to score goals.&#8221;
