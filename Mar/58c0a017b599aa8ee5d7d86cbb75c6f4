The Black Business Council (BBC) has confirmed that Mzwanele Manyi has officially resigned from his elected position as head of policy. The national office bearers of the BBC would like to thank Mzwanele for his time and dedication to the BBC and we wish him well in his future ventures, the council said in a statement Manyi s resignation was with effect from Monday, 20 March. He was elected as head of policy in September 2016. In his resignation letter to the BBC president, Danisa Baloyi, Manyi explained that the reasons for his resignation was due to ever increasing responsibilities and time constraints . He is the former chief executive of Government Communications and Information Systems (GCIS) and Cabinet spokesman, a former director-general at the department of labour, as well as former president of the Black Management Forum (BMF). Manyi is also a special adviser to Communications Minister, Faith Muthambi. Though Manyi would not be performing policy duties for the BBC any longer, he indicated on Twitter that he would continue to serve on the structures of the council. Just before haters pop [champagne], I will continue to serve in the BBC National Council where national office bearers account, Manyi tweeted. Manyi is also the president of Progressive Professionals Forum and the founder of the Decolonisation Foundation. He suggested that serving in these structures was not a way for him to earn a living. Even as former head of policy I was not paid one cent. I was BMF president for six years, didn t get paid one cent. Even as PPF president, Manyi said.
