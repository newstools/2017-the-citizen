Idols SA judge Unathi Msengana has just given her last show at Metro FM this morning after being with the station for 10 years. Msengana had been hosting the morning breakfast show The First Avenue the past couple of years with Glen Lewis. Taking to Instagram on Friday morning, Msengana wrote: &#8220;Well, that was my last show on Metro! Thank you for your love over the past decade.&#8221; Msengana&#8217;s exit is a huge blow to the station after it was announced that Glen Lewis, who has been in the SABC for 22 years, has also left the station to join Tbo Touch at his new station. Touch HD spokesperson Lulu Ndevu confirmed that Glen had joined the station. It is understood Glen will host the morning show on Touch HD, with Touch taking the reins of the afternoon drive show. Glen s departure comes after reports that Metro FM is in the process of shuffling presenters in what has been called its biggest shuffle to date. Most staffers are apparently unhappy about it, as it will separate best friends and pair others with people they do not really get along with.
