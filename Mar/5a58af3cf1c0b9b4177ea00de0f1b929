Dar es Salaam. While President John Magufuli has resolved to put the constitutional reform process on hold, ostensibly until further notice, there is still a ray of hope among some key stakeholders who in a major climbdown from their hardline approach last week formed a team to reach out to the Head of State.In no uncertain terms, Dr Magufuli has made his point known that giving Tanzanians a new constitution is not part of his agenda apparently not in his first term during which he s said he would be working to deliver on his major campaign promises.The President made no promise on the campaign trail ahead of the 2015 general election to deliver the much-awaited sacred document and this is not likely going to be an albatross around his neck.His stance took many by surprise who, for some reason, had somehow believed that the fifth phase government would revive the process.And after repeated futile efforts to have it their way, those lobbying for the immediate revival of the process have changed tone and tact hoping this time round a more diplomatic route would take them there.The new team to re-engage the State House includes members of the Tanzania Constitution Forum (TCF), representatives of religious leaders and academicians.Others are representatives of the Tanzania Lawyers Society (TLS), Zanzibar Lawyers Society (ZLS), women groups, Members of Parliament, representatives of the Association of Local Authorities of Tanzania (Alat) and some members of Isles House of Representatives.Last week they convened a two-day meeting dubbed the National Constitutional Conference, organised by TCF in Dar es Salaam.Their decision to adopt a softer approach is partly due to the fact that they have come to terms with the fact that the President is, at the moment, not legally bound to revive the process.Dr James Jesse of the University of Dar es Salaam (UDSM) told participants during the TCF conference that the Constitution Review Act of 2011 and the Referendum Act of 2013 were outdated, and, therefore, lacked legal powers to revive the process.According to him, an article giving the President the powers to declare the day for a referendum is outdated because events in the process had been given a specific timeframe and dates of implementation.He raised the issue in his presentation in a paper titled Referendum Act-time and its use . The UDSM don noted that articles setting the calendar for different events could not be re-used to lead the process. Therefore, the Referendum Act of 2013 has to be amended first if the referendum is to progress. Amendments will change the requirements provided for in article 4 and 5, which are now outdated, he said.In an interview with The Citizen, TCF chair Deus Kibamba said the conference had resolved that any attempt at resolving the stalemate on legal grounds would be futile going forward, hence the need to change tact.He noted that forging ahead with the constitutional review process now entirely depends on the Head of State. Our expectation is that the President will direct us on what should be done to revive the process after accommodating the issues that are missing in the proposed New Constitution, he said.He added: The conference has ordered the team to work on the Constitution Review Act of 2011 and the Referendum Act of 2013, to identify areas for amendment and prepare schedule amendments to the sections. Sticking issuesAccording to TCF programme officer Mchereli Machumbana, some of the unresolved issues are the structure of the Union, the powers of the President, appointment of ministers and their deputies and women s rights in property ownership and inheritance.There is also debate on whether or not to keep the office of regional and district commissioners, with Civil Society Organisations preferring that should they be retained, they at least have to be recruited as public servants as opposed to presidential appointees.Said Mr Machumbana: The proposed Constitution should also include the rights to assembly, rights of people with disabilities, ethics of public leaders and rights of various social groups. Despite the new, conciliatory tone from the constitution reform stakeholders who previously had, to a larger extent, been kind of bullish in approach, there are still mixed feelings on the prospects of success in negotiating with the State House.No political will?Mr Elijah Kondi, a political science lecturer at UDSM, supports the resolution to reach out to the President but is still less than convinced that the team will easily make a breakthrough. The President may decide to meet them, and promise to work on the process, yet what I see is the lack of political will to have this process finalised, he says.He argues that the current administration appears to have adopted actions and a leadership style that are supported by the 1977 constitution. The President is not ready to lose powers provided by the 1977 Constitution; the draft Constitution by the now defunct Constitution Review Commission (CRC) chaired by retired Justice Joseph Warioba proposes the reduction of such powers entrusted to the Head of State. Prof Mwesiga Baregu, a political science analyst from St Augustine University of Tanzania (Saut), shares the same view that reaching out is a good idea but still, the prospects of success are dim.But the university don, who served as a CRC commissioner, argues that it is not up to the President to decide whether or not to revive and conclude the process, regardless of whether it was part of his agenda or not.He says: I agree, the new Constitution wasn t part of his agenda, but this is a national agenda. Failing to implement it is working against the wishes of the people who elected him. Prof Baregu notes that the excuse given that there are more pressing issues, such as industrialisation, is not valid because the two are unrelated.He suggests that the process should proceed from where the draft constitution ended because it was the place where the national consensus is provided. We can get the new constitution using other methods but that wouldn t be the quality constitution required by the nation. It will plunge the country into unnecessary conflict, he says.Retired UDSM lecturer, Prof Ruth Meena, also supports the new strategy, but says there is still room to properly analyse it, and come to the conclusion that it is the best out of the available strategies. During their meeting with the Head of State two things can happen; they can seek his opinion on the future of Katiba, or they can convince him that there are issues of urgency, which require the new constitution process to resume, she says.Prof Gaudence Mpangala of the Ruaha University Catholic College (Rucu), says there are forces working behind the President to oppose the realisation of a new constitution. These powers are threatened by the new constitution, especially the Draft Constitution by the Warioba Commission because the document spells doom for them, he avers.He notes that among those against the new law are those who amassed wealth through fraudulent acts, and have been bent on frustrating constitutional reforms since the restoration of multi-party democracy in Tanzania.However, he is one of the optimists. The Head of State will rethink and revive the process, especially after recognising that the number of people waiting for the document is so huge, he adds.
