Olsson would have been out of contract at the end of the season, but he reached an agreement with Albion to terminate his deal so he could join the Stockholm-based club in time for the opening fixtures of the Swedish season next week. The 34-year-old spent nine years with Albion, helping them win promotion to the Premier League in 2010. &#8220;It&#8217;s all happened so quickly I&#8217;ve not had a chance to say a proper farewell to so many people,&#8221; Olsson told Albion&#8217;s website. &#8220;I will be back at the first chance to do that. But I&#8217;m really grateful to the club for helping me sort out this transfer. &#8220;I still feel I have a few good years in me but such is the quality of the competition at Albion for places in my position, it was getting harder and harder to see a first team opportunity.&#8221; Olsson had made only seven Premier League appearances this season and hadn&#8217;t played for Tony Pulis&#8217;s side since their 4-0 defeat at Tottenham in January.
