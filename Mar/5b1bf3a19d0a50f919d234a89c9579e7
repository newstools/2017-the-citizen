Viewers of the SABC2 soapie were stunned when two of the show s male characters shared a kiss in the middle of a restaurant shortly after Logan (Simon Tuit) meets with his lawyer to discuss his impending divorce from Divan (Arnu de Villiers). However, Divan walks in to tell Logan that he does not want to part ways with him, telling him he loves him and he&#8217;s his soulmate. Before this moment, viewers had no idea the two were married, not to mention their sexual orientation. For the two waitresses crushing on both men, this is how they find out they are gay (or possibly bisexual) as they look on. It was a big moment for 7de Laan, which has been on air for 17 years and has never even hinted that two men sharing a kiss might be something that happens in the real world. Other shows such as Generations, Rhythm City and Isidingo have already gone there though. One viewer said the scene was &#8220;walglik&#8221; (nauseating). Here is the kiss. Although it&#8217;s the full episode below, the clip will start at the point just before the kiss, when one of the handsome men comes walking in, much to the excitement and (within seconds) astonishment of the waitresses:
