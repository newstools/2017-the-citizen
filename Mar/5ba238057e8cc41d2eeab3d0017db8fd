The landslide of hype which precedes every successive Soweto Derby is starting to wear thin and fails, more often than not, to be backed up by the end product. As it so happens, the weekend s meeting between archrivals Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates produced some good football for the 70 000 fans at FNB Stadium, although yet another draw was the result. At the core of this derby fever is the relentless propaganda pumped out for the consumption of two sets of the most dedicated supporters in this country. The original Soweto Derby was fought out between Pirates and Moroka Swallows, a side which has since disappeared as a power in the Premier League. But as sport is of a cyclical nature, the rise of Chiefs has replaced the demise of the once mighty Birds. Along with this has been the upsurge of modern technology and rapid-fire communications. And the pressures on the clubs, coaches, players, fans and commentators have increased exponentially to turn a game into an imagined extravaganza. It is unfair on all partakers in this already difficult equation. The saving grace this weekend was that both sides managed a goal better perhaps than a no-score draw.
