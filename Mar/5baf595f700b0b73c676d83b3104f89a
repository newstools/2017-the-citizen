The journey has been one off rough terrain, but I&#8217;m proud of myself for staying true to myself. God blessed me with so much strength and yet such a delicate soul. He blessed me with a mother who never gave up. A little bother who is dynamite, a family who raise WOMAN from soil that only sowed weeds. Blessed me with a journey that built my character and a Besty for lifey as a hubby for that I am ever grateful This year is for God/Allah/Nkulu Nkulu/modimo #birthdayweekend #simplylive #simplylove #simplyenhle&#x1f393;&#x1f33a;&#x1f36d; #CONTENT A post shared by Enhle Mbali Maphumulo (@enhlembali_) on Mar 3, 2017 at 10:10am PST Ngiz&#8217;mele nje. #opticalillusion &#x1f4f7; @enhlembali_ A post shared by Black Coffee (@realblackcoffee) on Mar 4, 2017 at 10:03am PST Birthday yeCherrie yam Love doesn&#8217;t live here,but deep in our Hearts.
