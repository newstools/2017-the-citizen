With a little practice, we think Minnie Dlamini could definitely take her rapping skills to an impressive level, judging by how she spit bars when Emtee asked her to rap. She was interviewing him when he said he thought she could rap, asking her to give it a try. Rapping is something Minnie has never done before, but we think she did better than some who have been in the industry for a long time. Watch the video she posted below of her giving this rap life a chance: @emteethehustla and I in studio.
