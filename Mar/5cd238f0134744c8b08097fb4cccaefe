Castle Lite Unlocks has taken things up one more notch by announcing hip-hop sensations Bryson Tiller and Travis Scott as the main acts for this year s concert. Tiller and Scott will perform at the Castle Lite Unlocks Concerts on the 15th and 16th of June in Johannesburg and Polokwane. Castle Lite has added Polokwane to the performance roster. This will be the very first time the Unlocks concert hits the city. In partnership with Channel O, the announcement was a star-studded event held at Johannesburg s swanky rooftop venue Thirteen. Anchored by sizzling Channel O and Vuzu presenter Nomuzi Mabena, it was attended by some of the country s top entertainment acts including Cassper Nyovest, Nomzamo Mbatha, Lalla Hirayama, DJ Warras and Maps Maponyane, to mention but a few. The reveal lived up to its high expectations, treating guests to an exclusive shindig. I m excited to come down and share the stage with some of Africa s hottest hip hop acts as part of the Castle Lite Unlocks Experience. It has always been a dream of mine to take my music to all parts of the world and performing at this concert is a very dope moment for me said Travis Scott, the Antidote hit maker.
