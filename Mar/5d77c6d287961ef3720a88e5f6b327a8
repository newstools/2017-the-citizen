What exactly is Safety and Security Minister David Mahlobo thinking? His comments on Sunday that government plan to regulate social media has justifiably caused a massive outcry. It s not the first time government have mentioned the idea of regulating social media, but when Mahlobo said the regulation was being considered because of fake news and scams he opened up a hornet s nest. People vented their anger and frustrations on social media immediately. Experts and analysts slammed the idea, suggesting it had nothing to do with fake news and more to do with placing more control over the internet, leading to a state which thinks it could think on behalf of the public. Political analyst Ralph Mathekga was spot on when he said: South Africans were intelligent enough to know fake news when they saw it . Fake news is a global phenomenon. This is just an attempt to censor South Africans, he said. South Africans don t need protection. This will have more consequences on the democracy. Freedom of expression is enshrined in our constitution. Regulating social media is an attack on our democracy. Any attempt to control what people think and say should be dismissed in the strongest way. For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
