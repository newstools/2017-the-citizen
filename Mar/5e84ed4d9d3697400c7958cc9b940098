The Presidency has confirmed President Jacob Zuma will not be attending African National Congress (ANC) struggle stalwart Ahmed Kathrada s funeral this morning in compliance with the wishes of the family. A statement released by Zuma s office said Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa would lead the government delegation to the services. The statement follows reports on Tuesday that Zuma could possibly be barred from attending Kathrada s funeral. A close friend of the family revealed to The Mail &amp; Guardian that during the last moments of his life, Kathrada allegedly said he did not want the president to attend his funeral. Kathrada died on Tuesday morning following a short illness. He was 87 years old. The two had been at odds after the late Kathrada penned an open letter to Zuma in 2016, urging him to resign as president. Kathrada s funeral is expected to be an inter-faith service, but the late struggle veteran will be buried according to Muslim rites.
