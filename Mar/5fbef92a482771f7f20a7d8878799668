Things may be over between the two, but it does not mean Cassper Nyovest does not find his ex-girlfriend Boitumelo &#8216;Boity&#8217; Thulo attractive any more. In an interview with Club 808, the Mama I Made It hit maker was talking about the artists he has been working with on his new album when Boity decided to rock up unexpectadly behind him. Cassper looked at her and could not continue with what he was saying, only saying &#8220;eish ntwana&#8221;, while licking his lips. Watch the hilarious video below: LMAO awkward or awkward? @Boity @CassperNyovest why you lick your lips like that? pic.twitter.com/3zTqHFdnNL &mdash; Mos. (@Mos_iiXXV) March 3, 2017 Since this incident, fans have been calling for them to get back together because &#8220;there is still chemistry between them&#8221;. &#8220;These two should just get back together. Cassper got confused man,&#8221; said one. The pair, who came out to the public about their relationship in July 2015, caught fans off guard last year after Boity confirmed the pair had split due to time constraints. She further denied reports that the rapper had cheated on her. In the video interview, she said: We broke up in December last year. I cried about it I got angry about it &#8230; but eventually life continues. Also read: She deserved better than me &#8211; Cassper on Boity
