A task team made up of cabinet ministers, headed by minister in the presidency Jeff Radebe, has reportedly decided to terminate negotiations with CPS, the company that was seen as the last hope in ensuring that social grants are distributed successfully come April 1st. According to the Mail &amp; Guardian, acting Sassa CEO Wiseman Magasela told the Constitutional Court in an affidavit that the committee had decided that the current negotiations with CPS should be terminated and fresh negotiations should start afresh only if and when the National Treasury gave its prior written approval . The team is said to have included Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan, State Security Minister David Mahlobo, Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba, Telecommunications Minister Siyabonga Cwele, and Science and Technology Minister Naledi Pandor. Meanwhile, the EFF and DA have accused Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini of conspiring to put government in the position where it has no choice but to renew its contract with Cash Paymaster Services (CPS), even after the Constitutional Court damningly ruled in 2014 that the company s contract, ending on March 31, was invalid. The EFF once again questioned the minister s motives after a City Press report suggested the SA Social Security Agency s (Sassa s) hand had been forced when it failed to report back to the Constitutional Court last month about the plan to pay out social grants from April. Sassa CEO Thokozani Magwaza told the newspaper that on numerous occasions his office s plans to approach the Constitutional Court for guidance had been abruptly halted by last-minute instructions from Dlamini. The DA has questioned Dlamini s motives in insisting CPS continue to pay out the grants after a Sunday Times report indicated President Jacob Zuma s lawyer, Michael Hulley, had held meetings with Dlamini and top Sassa officials to advise them to continue with the CPS contract. &#8211; Additional reporting by Simnikiwe Hlatshaneni
