Psychiatric patients in the Northern Cape continue to be held in prisons due to a shortage of beds at existing facilities in the province, Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi said in a written parliamentary reply published on Monday. There are a total of 26 State patients currently accommodated in Correctional Services facilities in the Northern Cape, said Motsoaledi. The minister said the matter was raised with him by the Justice and Correctional Services Minister Michael Masutha in September last year. I discussed this issue with all the Health MECs at a meeting of the National Health Council (NHC) in the same month, said Motsoaledi. The requirements and plans for each province including the Northern Cape to alleviate the current challenges were agreed to, including prioritising building of new facilities where required or adding additional wards in already existing State facilities. The Kimberley Mental Health Hospital was meant to be completed in 2008 at a cost of just under R900 million. The building price had since skyrocketed to just under R2 billion, with construction still incomplete. African News Agency For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
