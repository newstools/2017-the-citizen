If you&#8217;ve been wanting to follow the finance minister on Twitter, then you&#8217;ll have to settle for a parody account that showcases &#8216;Gordhan&#8217;s&#8217; rapping skills. The minister has come under the spotlight again after he was ordered to return form an investor roadshow with his deputy, Mcebisi Jonas. His recall has raised speculation that a Cabinet reshuffle is on the cards after the top six met at Luthuli house on Monday. Here are some of the most noteworthy tweets from the account: Fresh after a recall, the rand drops like a lead football. I&#39;m back at Luthuli House; I&#39;ll keep at this damned game of cat and mouse. pic.twitter.com/wCQUlCnvKF &mdash; Pravin Gordhan (@pravingordhan) March 28, 2017 You may not like my sound, But trust me: I got perfect pitch.
