Earlier this week, Dean Elgar was asked about the University Oval in Dunedin&#8217;s pitch. There was a wry smile before he termed it &#8220;juicy&#8221; but, as it turned out, he was actually saying &#8220;challenge accepted&#8221;. The hardnosed Proteas opener was his side&#8217;s hero on Wednesday as he struck an unbeaten 128 to guide them to 229/4 at the close of the first day of the first Test against New Zealand. Also read: Faf is convinced the Proteas need an under-cooked Morne Morkel Elgar had already established himself as Mr Reliable in the home series against Sri Lanka but this knock was truly the mark of the man who takes a crisis in his stride. On what was indeed a spicy surface, South Africa slumped to 22/3 after Faf du Plessis won the toss and decided to bat. That was a significant decision &#8211; it was the first time in 23 Tests that a captain in New Zealand chose to take first strike. And it seemed to have backfired. Stephen Cook (3) was trapped LBW after he left a Trent Boult delivery that moved back into him. It would seem Hashim Amla&#8217;s hundred in his 100th Test in the Proteas&#8217; last Test has also been a false dawn. The bearded stalwart&#8217;s problems outside off-stump continue after he tried to drive a fiery Neil Wagner (2/59) but only managed to leave a gap between bat and pad. Wagner, born and bred in Pretoria, then had JP Duminy (1) caught at slip with a magnificent bouncer as the absence of AB de Villiers suddenly looked big again. But Du Plessis was on hand to help Elgar flourish. Both men are known for their grittiness and displayed it in a fourth-wicket partnership of 126. It was rather unexpected when Du Plessis, who had just survived a leg-before decision following a review, hit Jimmy Neesham to mid-wicket and was caught. That was not the type of shot needed in that situation but the captain&#8217;s 52 off 118 was nonetheless valuable. Pleasingly, Temba Bavuma hit 7 fours in his unbeaten 38 off 101 to suggest his poor form during the home season might be over. It also confirmed another curious thing about the diminutive batter &#8211; he really does seem to lift his game when the pressure is on. In fact, all his highest scores in Test cricket have been scored when the Proteas are in a spot of bother. Yet in the end, it was the indomitable Elgar that stole the show &#8230; slowly.
