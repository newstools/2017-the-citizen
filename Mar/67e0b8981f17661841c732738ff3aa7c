Ntandoyenkosi Kunene, Miss South Africa 2016, might be waving her crown goodbye, but she gets to keep her parents. Mom Baby and dad Christopher were arguably the best dressed couple appearing on the 2017 Miss South Africa black carpet at the Superbowl in Sun City. The Mpumalanga-based couple wore kangas to this year s ceremony and let s just say they made people wearing designer labels feel basic. Honoured to have with us @MIssKunene&#8216;s parents. We cannot thank you enough. #MissSA2016 #MissSA2017 pic.twitter.com/hXETqhGSQb Miss South Africa (@Official_MissSA) March 26, 2017
