It was reported on Friday night that Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini filed her court papers to the Constitutional Court electronically after it was initially reported that she had missed the deadline to do so. The deadline was Friday for her to file a response with the Constitutional Court explaining why she should not personally pay the costs of her legal fees over the social grants saga. Her department confirmed that she had filed her affidavit electronically. Earlier this month, the ConCourt ruled that the minister was responsible for the crisis that led to the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) being unable to give assurances for the payment of about 17 million social grants to poor and vulnerable citizens dependent on government for social assistance on April 1. The court extended Sassa s contract with service provider Cash Paymaster Services (CPS) for another 12 months following an application by The Black Sash Trust, which asked the court to resume its supervisory role over the payment of grants. The ConCourt had ruled in 2014 that the contract with CPS was constitutionally invalid. For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
