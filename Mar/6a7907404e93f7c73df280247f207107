Okay so maybe the heading is a little misleading, there is nothing confusing about Audi s desire to play in the ever expanding compact SUV market with their new Q2, and steal some premium sales from the likes of BMW and Mercedes-Benz. . From the outside the Q2 hits the spot; it has that whole younger more colourful feel to it while still remaining true to current Audi design language. So if you are an Audi design fan, then you will immediately approve. Even if you are fence sitting, you can t deny the charm of this compact SUV. Inside, it s a similar Audi story: the Q2 has that solid quality feel about it, and our test car had a long option list, so there was everything one could want on board from the likes of MMI Navigation Plus, to deluxe automatic air-conditioning, to adaptive cruise control and Audi virtual cockpit. The only downside is that you feel that should these options not be there, there would not be a lot of spec left to speak of. . Space is adequate for four adults, but this is a car for a young family, singles or even trendy empty nesters. The boot space is also okay but you will find more space in other better priced competitors, if you are prepared to open up your options to out of the premium segment. The test Q2 we had was the 110kW / 250Nm 1.4T FSI Sport fitted with a six-speed manual and comes with clever cylinder on demand (COD) technology. The COD system on the manual deactivates the second and third cylinder at loads up to 100Nm and while coasting when engine speed is between 2000 and 3200rpm. And this is said to return a fuel consumption of 5.4 litres per 100km, but try as I did, I could never get down to this number. My test week settled on 8.5 litres per 100km and this I feel would be far more accurate in the real world. . There is absolutely nothing wrong with the smooth and easy shifting manual transmission, but in this easy shifting traffic soaked world, especially in premium segment, I really can t see too many buyers opting for the manual transmission. Handling is predictably easy and light, if somewhat a bit firmer than other softer options on the market. Dynamics always comes at the price of comfort, but if this concerns you, opt and pay extra for the optional suspension with damper control and Audi Drive Select handling system that lets you not only choose between five modes: auto, comfort, dynamic, efficiency and individual, but also have your way with the ride quality you receive. There is no Quattro drive on offer at this stage, so even though there is an ESC Offroad mode and nearly 15cm of ground clearance, I wouldn t venture too far off the beaten path. The last thing you will want is some guy in his rugged Toyota Fortuner pulling you out the sand. . Perhaps of lesser importance for a car like this, the Q2 hit 100km/h in under 10 seconds, and went just over 210km/h at top. The detailed road test statistics are shown on this page. The funky styling and colourful options come at a heavy premium with a base Q2 1.4T FSI Sport Manual coming in at R511 000, and our particular car was fitted with another R120 940 worth of goodies. So as good as what this Q2 is, the part that confuses me is that if you will never quite get A3 hatch dynamics or Q3 quattro space and practicability with this new offering from Audi, and if you are prepared to shop outside of the premium brands, there is also a number of better priced and specced options to choose from.
