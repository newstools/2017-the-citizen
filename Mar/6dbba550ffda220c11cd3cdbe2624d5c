Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan, his deputy Mcebisi Jonas, director general Lungisa Fuzile, key National Treasury officials, and business and labour representatives will embark on a non-deal international investor roadshow next week. The delegation will spend two days in London (March 27 and 28), one day in Boston in the United States (March 29), and two days in New York (March 30 and 31), the Treasury said in a statement on Saturday. This follows extensive engagements by senior National Treasury officials with domestic investors following the tabling of the 2017 budget by the minister of finance. Treasury has a consistent and longstanding strategy of engaging investors on a regular basis. The purpose of this is to provide an update on the most recent developments, engage constructively with investors, and share government s thinking behind its latest policy proposals, the statement said.
