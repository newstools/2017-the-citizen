The shark that beached on a sandbank near The Point in Western Cape has died. It is thought to have been a young female. Owen Govender, senior section ranger for SANParks Lakes, confirmed on Monday that the shark had died, Knysnaplett Herald reported. The whale shark was last seen in the Ashmead Channel near the SANparks offices this morning. This follows her ordeal in the estuary this weekend after the first rescue on Saturday. Honorary SANParks rangers tried swimming with the whale shark earlier today. She was, however, declared dead and samples have been taken for marine biologists at Bayworld in Port Elizabeth to analyse, but the cause of death was almost certainly a change in water temperature. A cold water offshore more than likely made the whale shark come into the estuary seeking warmer water, said Govender. He said owing to the fact that low tide was even lower than usual because of spring tide, this would probably have caused the animal to beach. The first time she beached on Saturday morning she was helped back into the water by the NSRI, paddlers, members of the public and SANParks. On Saturday around 16:00 we got her as far as the Ashmead Channel and were hopeful she would swim out to sea, but she was seen again in the vicinity on Sunday morning heading towards Leisure Island. She completely disappeared on Sunday evening until we saw her this morning, said Govender. He said everyone from SANParks honorary rangers to the NSRI and members of the public were thanked for their efforts in helping her. Tissue samples will now be taken from the body and then SANParks will take the body out of The Heads to sea as soon as conditions allow. This was one of those cases where nature took its natural toll and despite all efforts by SANParks and others, nothing more could be done, said Govender. &#8211; Caxton News Service For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
