A case against a couple from Barberton, in Mpumalanga, who are accused of child pornography, has been postponed. The couple were caught with an alleged explicit pornographic video of their own seven-year-old daughter on a cellphone, Lowvelder reported. The father was in the process of selling the cellphone when a vigilant shop assistant noticed a video of a woman and a little girl apparently performing a strip dance and making explicit gestures. They were arrested at Cash Converters in Mbombela in August 2013. The girl was moved to a place of safety. The father, 41, and mother, 37, who cannot be named to protect the identity of their minor daughter, appeared in the regional court on charges of possessing, manufacturing, and distributing child pornography, as well as grooming for sexual purposes. Magistrate Vanessa Joubert postponed the matter for continuation until April 24. &#8211; Caxton News Service For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
