Whenever opponents play the Sharks at the moment, they probably hate the thought of having to tackle Jean-Luc du Preez. It&#8217;s quite understandable. The 21-year-old is a hulking man-mountain at 1.94m and 113kg and he&#8217;s really difficult to stop. There&#8217;s actually a stat that proves it &#8211; Du Preez has broken a tackle five times to date, meaning he&#8217;s either wiggled or bumped himself out of the arms of a defender. He&#8217;s actually done that the second-most times in this year&#8217;s tournament. So if you&#8217;re already sort of dispirited just by the thought of having to stop one Du Preez, imagine having to do it with two on the field. Also read: What the Faf? Allister Coetzee dumps Lions&#8217; De Klerk It&#8217;s a scary thought because it&#8217;s happening already. The past two weeks have seen the Du Preez twins, Jean-Luc and Dan, playing in tandem during the second half of matches. Dan is actually taller than his brother at 1.96m and weights 112kg. But it&#8217;s taken more than a year for rugby fans to see these two giants playing alongside each other. While Jean-Luc has established himself over the past two seasons, Dan has been stuck on the sidelines with a groin injury. It&#8217;s the type of frustrating injury that can mentally hamper most 21-year-olds. But Jean-Luc is pretty confident his brother bears no mental scars. &#8220;Look, he was out for 10 months. I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s easy for any player to handle that type of frustration,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Dan obviously was frustrated too but I feel he handled it really well. I&#8217;m actually really proud of him and happy to have him back playing alongside me.&#8221; A strong brotherly bond definitely also helped as the twins are very close and still live at home with father Robert, the Sharks&#8217; head coach. &#8220;We live together, so we almost by default rely on each other. We see each other a lot. Well, relatively because nowadays he spends three times a week at his girlfiend,&#8221; said Jean-Luc with a chuckle. &#8220;But yes, I&#8217;d like to think my support helped.&#8221; The inclusion of 13 Sharks players, numerous of them rookies like Du Preez and 19-year-old Curwin Bosch, for this weekend&#8217;s Springbok training camp illustrates how quickly the Durbanites&#8217; youngsters take responsibility. &#8220;It&#8217;s nice to see,&#8221; said Du Preez. &#8220;We have a culture that the individual that comes into the team needs to step up, young or experienced. You can&#8217;t be hesitant, so we all want to be professional and step up.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
