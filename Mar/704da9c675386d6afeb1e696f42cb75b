While Fifi Cooper, A-Reece and Benchmarq may have left Ambitiouz Entertainment to start their own record label and pursue their music careers independently, Emtee is flourishing. Together with Amanda Black, Sjava and Saudi, they are still doing pretty well. So much so that Emtee copped himself a four-bedroom house for himself, son and longtime girlfriend. The house has a backyard pool, four bedrooms and a home studio. &#x1f607;&#x1f64f;&#x1f3fe;&#x1f3e7;#ambitiouz A post shared by Ruff (@ruff_1020_atm) on Feb 12, 2017 at 10:58am PST Home studio Creating loops ..&#x1f3e7; #ambitiouz #BobMarley A post shared by Ruff (@ruff_1020_atm) on Feb 18, 2017 at 7:07am PST &nbsp; F
