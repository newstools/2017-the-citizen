The Beijing Guoan forward&#8217;s header ensured China&#8217;s first win of in the final qualifying group &#8212; and only their second victory over the Koreans in 32 attempts. The victory sent a packed Helong Stadium into raptures as China, who were bottom and winless after five games in Group A, gave themselves a glimmer of hope of reaching Russia 2018. The game was played against the backdrop of high political tensions following Chinese anger over South Korea&#8217;s deployment of a controversial missile defence system. In front of a partisan crowd and a heavy security presence, South Korea were on top early on but they had a warning when Yu forced a smart save from Kwoun Sun-Tae near the half-hour. And Yu broke through on 34 minutes when he nodded China ahead from a corner &#8212; ending a 407-minute goal drought stretching back to their 3-2 defeat to the Koreans in September. South Korea nearly hit back quickly and Ji Dong-Won twice brushed the top of the netting before China made it to the break with a shock 1-0 lead. South Korea threw on giant forward Kim Shin-Wook for the second half and as they poured forward in search of an equaliser, the game opened up with chances for both sides. Korean captain Ki Sung-Yueng let fly with a rocket of a shot on 65 minutes, and Chinese substitute Wu Xi had a curling effort saved at the other end. On 75 minutes, China&#8217;s Zeng Cheng saved brilliantly from Ji&#8217;s close-range header, and Hong Jeong-Ho saw another attempt cleared off the line as China defended stoutly. The lone flare-up came when Korea&#8217;s Hwang Hee-Chan lashed out at a prone Yin Hongbo in the final minutes, and it was ultimately a deserved win for Lippi&#8217;s well-marshalled team. China will now play war-torn Syria away on Tuesday with renewed confidence, knowing another victory could put them in the hunt for third place in the group and a play-off berth.
