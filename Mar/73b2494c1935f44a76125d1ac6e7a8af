Mercedes-Benz upcoming bakkie has traveled to the Geneva Motor Show to reveal its &#8216;concrete outlook&#8217;, and these images prove we&#8217;re not far from driving it on our shores. . The bakkie comes in two variants and it will be launched internationally in late 2017 and likely to be in SA early 2018 under the name Mercedes-Benz X-Class, South Africa will be one of its main markets. The final design promises to blend elements from two related design concepts, one presented as the &#8220;powerful adventurer&#8221; and the other as a &#8220;stylish explorer&#8221;. The &#8220;adventurer&#8221; is clad in a sporty yellow-green hue with knobby tyres and lifted suspension, evoking a traditional pickup with a focus on off-road capabilities and rigged styling. . The &#8220;explorer&#8221; appears to share a closer relationship with Mercedes-Benz&#8217; existing lineup. Designers opted for a classy white metallic paint and 22-inch chrome wheels, giving the pickup a more upscale appearance. The production edition will presumably tone down the styling a bit more, especially at the rear end. Unique styling elements will remain, though its overall shape is unlikely to stray far from its Nissan Navara underpinnings. . The X-Class interior promises to be full of Mercedes-Benz design elements, borrowing components from the C-Class and V-Class. The German automaker will integrate high-quality materials and its own infotainment and seating systems. The company has confirmed that a V6 diesel engine will power the top-of-the-line trim, paired with 4MATIC permanent all-wheel drive, though additional powertrain details remain unclear. The latest Navara is only offered with a choice between various four-cylinder mills, suggesting Mercedes-Benz will use its own engines. . &#8220;Our future X-Class will be a pickup that knows no compromise,&#8221; promises Mercedes-Benz Vans head Volker Mornhinweg. &#8220;Ladder-type frame, high-torque six-cylinder engine, and permanent all-wheel drive are compulsory for us.&#8221; The X-Class will launch later in 2017 and likely to land on our shores in 2018. Pricing and further information still remain coy at this stage.
