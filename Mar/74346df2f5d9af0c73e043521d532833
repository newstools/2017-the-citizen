Things don&#8217;t seem to be going well for President Jacob Zuma&#8217;s daughter, who is going through a protracted divorce battle from her rich husband. The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, has lost out on R700 000 for overseas trips and R10 000 monthly for private security as part of the interim maintenance by her husband. She had, in court papers, demanded that her husband pay for her two overseas trips a year and two local trips to Cape Town, in addition to another destination of her choice in South Africa. The husband, who has reportedly agreed to pay only for the local trips, said the overseas trips were &#8220;lavish and extravagant expense and should be disallowed&#8221;. He therefore did not agree to pay for them, Sunday World has reported. On the security expenses of R10 000 monthly, the husband reportedly rejected paying for them too, saying they were unnecessary, as their home is located in a secure estate. He, however, offered to upgrade the security system at a cheaper rate. Zuma&#8217;s daughter will also not be getting the services of two nurses, as the husband reportedly said their services that cost him R21 000 were unnecessary as she had medical aid. The first daughter has also applied to stop her husband&#8217;s child with a nyatsi from being introduced to their children. However, she also lost that battle, as the husband claims his wife was being unreasonable and had always known about the child. The husband&#8217;s extramarital affairs are reportedly among the reasons the wife filed for a divorce, though the husband has claimed the child was conceived before they got married. He also rejected his wife&#8217;s demand of R168 700 in spousal maintenance, saying he could only afford to pay R67 000 monthly.
