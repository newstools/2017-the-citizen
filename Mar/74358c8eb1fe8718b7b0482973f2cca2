Dar es Salaam. The spotlight is once again on policymakers and the corridors of power within government as major legal hurdles continue to be a blight on Tanzania s multi-billion dollar extractive sector.Now nearly two years after the promulgation of milestone laws to regulate the sector that has faced criticism from various quarters for underperformance , debate rages on, on what the authorities could have been done better to maximise potential.In July 2015, the National Assembly endorsed the Petroleum Act of 2015, the Oil and Gas Revenue Management Act and the Tanzania Extractive Industries (transparency and Accountability) Acts, even as pressure intensified from stakeholders who asked the government to shelve the bills to allow for further consultations.In the same year, then-President Jakaya Kikwete also assented to the Tanzania Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative Secretariat (TEITI). This is a multi-stakeholder initiative that was formed to increase transparency and accountability in the extractive industries.Yet one-and-half years since, a general feeling of dissatisfaction is still the common denominator among the major stakeholders of the extractive sector. A plethora of legal gaps that policymakers are being accused of sitting on, leaving the country counting its losses, is their serious bone of contention.At a recent breakfast meeting of extractive industry stakeholders in Dar es Salaam, the government and policymakers were mostly at the receiving end of the barrage of criticism for not doing enough. One of the major concerns raised was that the authorities had failed to address the crucial question regarding beneficial ownership of the country s vast mineral resources.A beneficial owner is a person who enjoys the benefits of ownership even though title to some form of property is in another name. It also means any individual or group of individuals who, either directly or indirectly, has the power to vote or influence the transaction decisions regarding a specific security, such as shares in a company. When it comes to natural resources the government of the day must ensure that the principle of permanent sovereign ownership applies; meaning that the country is supposed to be the primary beneficiary of these resources, not the companies, not someone else, said Dr Rugemeleza Nshala, executive director of the Lawyers Environmental Action Team, said.According to him, Tanzania is still losing a lot from the extractive sector due to legal loopholes that have left it prone to manipulation and exploitation. The country must be the one receiving the highest percentage of profits. He echoed remarks made by President John Magufuli last November during a meeting with editors.The President said Tanzania was planning to further tighten controls on its mining sector to ensure that the country maximises the benefits from its wealth of natural resources.Vast depositsTanzania is Africa s fourth-largest gold producer, and also has vast deposits of natural gas, coal, diamonds, uranium and gemstones. Tanzania has a lot of minerals, but there have been a lot of funny deals ... we have to look carefully at our laws so that we move forward as a country, Dr Magufuli told a news conference at State House in Dar es Salaam.He said the new administration recently approved new mining regulations aimed at ensuring that the benefits of the mining sector are shared more equitably between multinational mining companies and the state.Last week, the President reiterated the ban on exportation of mineral sand for smelting abroad. He said the country must build its own gold smelters to stop such exports because they cost the state huge losses in potential revenue.And on Friday, the Energy and Minerals ministry announced an immediate ban on sending copper concentrate or mineral sand for processing abroad.The impact was immediate. Already, there are reports that one of the biggest firms operating in the country Acacia Mining s shares fell as much as 19 per cent on Friday after the company said it had stopped gold and copper concentrate exports.There could be more closures, industry players have warned. However, risks and threats of closures may fall on deaf ears there is no sign yet that the government is planning on backing down.Apparently, there is a general consensus that there are just still too many dark areas in the extractive sector.And Dr Nshala said at the monthly breakfast meeting organised by Policy Forum recently that one year since the birth of the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative, proceeds and profits from the mining companies operating in Tanzania remain a closely-guarded secret.But Ms Alice Swai, a representative of the Tanzania Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative Secretariat, told the meeting that the TEITI had actually made some progress in improving transparency in the management of the extractive sector.She cited the framework for disclosure that now makes it an obligation for the mostly multinational mining companies operating in the country to disclose some key information with regards to their activities.According to her, the TEITI has also helped in ensuring the reliability of data from the extractive sector regarding payments, revenue and production. It was previously hard to get accurate and reliable data on these, she noted. The initiative has helped strengthen accountability among the extractive companies and government entities; one of the recommendations for data to be digitalised to make it easily accessible. This increases transparency, she said.Nevertheless, questions linger on government s commitment in ensuring that the committee performs its duties without undue political influence. For example, while the TEITI is touted as an independent body, there have been more questions than answers on why it has taken the government all this time to appoint a chairperson to stir the body.The chair is supposed to be appointed by the President.Apparently, some lobby groups have been anxiously awaiting the appointment, saying it would be at least serve as a sign of sincerity from the government.Leadership vacuumAt the breakfast meeting, one of the concerns raised was that the vacancy in the critical TEITI office left a leadership vacuum that in itself could be denying the country the opportunity to urgently redress the imbalances in the extractive sector, through overseeing the implementation of the new regulations on taxes and royalties.Explaining why it had taken so long to fill the post, Ms Swai said they were yet to find the right candidate after those who applied for the post fell short of the required qualifications. Most of those who applied were below the required age; the majority of them were less than 30 years old, and their experience was not enough. The position requires needs someone beyond the age of 30, she said.Mr Donald Kasongi, a development consultant with a Mwanza-based organisation known as Government Links Tanzania, also wants the issue of corporate social responsibility addressed.He says there is need for a legally-binding rule to ensure that companies in the extractive sector are more transparent in implementing their CSR policies.
