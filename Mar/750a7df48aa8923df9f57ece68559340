Nottingham Road police and K9 task team members made a breakthrough in the investigations of the Soliks murders when they arrested three wanted suspects, aged 31 and 42, at Umlazi in Durban and in the Impendle area near Pietermaritzburg on Friday night, KwaZulu-Natal police said. The members worked through the night searching for the suspects and the information directed them to Umlazi where the main suspect was arrested. Further investigation led them to Impendle where two suspects were arrested and found in possession of two unlicensed firearms and suspected stolen property, the South African Police Service said in a statement on the official SAPS Facebook page on Saturday. One of the recovered firearm was reported stolen in Orlando, Soweto, in Johannesburg. The confiscated firearms would be sent for ballistic testing to determine whether they were used in the commission of crime in the country. The arrested men would appear in the Howick Magistrate s Court on Monday, the statement said. KwaZulu-Natal acting police commissioner Maj-Gen Bheki Langa welcomed the arrests and applauded the officers for their perseverance. We re delighted that the criminals who believed that they will break the law and hide are now arrested. We will ensure that the suspects are successfully prosecuted, he said. Christine, 57, and Roger Solik, 66, were kidnapped from their home in a Nottingham Road estate during a robbery in February. Their bodies were later found in a river in Impendle about 70km from their home.
