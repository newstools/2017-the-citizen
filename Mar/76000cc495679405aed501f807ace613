Minister of Sports and Recreation Fikile Mbalula is not taking his chances when it comes to the success of our national team, Bafana Bafana. The South African Football Association (Safa) announced the new squad today in a press conference at Safa House, but the new coach was not announced. But there are those who do not think a new coach will solve the national team&#8217;s woes, much to Mbalula&#8217;s outrage, who acted swiftly and took his worries to the Lord in prayer. A Twitter user tweeted Mbalula and said even Manchester United coach Jos Mourinho could not save the national team. &#8220;Bafana Bafana will always be a bunch of losers cause of lack of development,&#8221; they said. He said the team would continue to lose because Safa was busy spending &#8220;millions&#8221; on coaches instead of developing the team. &#8220;SAFA is so concerned about coaches rather football development in SA.&#8221; But the minister was not willing to allow this &#8220;sangoma of darkness&#8221; cast their spell to worsen the team&#8217;s woes, so he prayed in tongues. Hayi Hayi Sangoma sobumnyama. Fire fire rakho lokho shanda ndiya to this prediction of doom. FIRE https://t.co/dA11gtPhl6 &mdash; RSA Min of Sport (@MbalulaFikile) March 8, 2017 &#8220;Hayi Hayi Sangoma sobumnyama [sangoma of darkness]. Fire fire rakho lokho shanda ndiya to this prediction of doom. Fire,&#8221; he said. Mbalula&#8217;s spirituality seems to have been heightened of late, having suspected the use of a doom prophet during the U20 Afcon semifinal match between Zambia and Amajita. The SA side lost 1-0, in a match that took place at the National Heroes Stadium in Lusaka, Zambia, on Wednesday night. &#8220;Is there a doom pastor there #AFFONu20,&#8221; he tweeted during the match.
