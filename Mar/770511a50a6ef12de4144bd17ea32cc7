Keshav Maharaj on Friday should finally have settled a debate that many people in South African cricket don&#8217;t readily want to accept. The Proteas don&#8217;t need a flashy Test spinner with a big personality. They don&#8217;t need to futilely try to find a Shane Warne or hope Imran Tahir can still make it in the five-day format. Also read: Keshav Maharaj prospers on old-fashioned day of Test cricket All they need to do is appreciate left-arm spinners who do their job without fuss. South African cricket didn&#8217;t really afford Paul Harris that treatment, so they have the chance to do so with Maharaj. During the third day&#8217;s play of the first Test against Dunedin, the 27-year-old Dolphins stalwart snapped up his maiden five-wicket haul in Test cricket. His the first South African spinner to do that in New Zealand for 53 years. And the beauty of Maharaj&#8217;s spell of 5/94, which restricted the home side&#8217;s lead to 33, was that it wasn&#8217;t magical at all. It was thoughtful, effective and adaptive on a pitch that doesn&#8217;t support the spinners. To illustrate how versatile Maharaj is, one only needed to look at his improvement from the second to third days. I wasn&#8217;t happy with the way I bowled initially,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I spoke to (Proteas spin bowling coach) Claude Henderson and we addressed a small technical thing. I also decided to change my mindset.&#8221; Maharaj&#8217;s different approach wasn&#8217;t even radical. In fact, he merely went to his default setting: keeping it tight. &#8220;I just kept things simple when we started play (on Friday),&#8221; said Maharaj. &#8220;And it paid dividends. It s extremely tough to bowl on this pitch. There&#8217;s no pace on the ball. &#8220;I have a slower trajectory through the air and that makes it a bit more difficult. When the new ball came along it just skidded. It wasn t really turning much.&#8221; It all sounds like the talk of a man who didn&#8217;t taste much success and yet there was Maharaj, boasting five victims. One has to ask then: what does this Proteas side need from its spinner when its biggest strength remains its pace attack? The answer is simple. It&#8217;s Keshav Maharaj.
