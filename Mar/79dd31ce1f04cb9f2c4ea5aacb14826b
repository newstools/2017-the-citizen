Old Mutual has agreed to sell a 24.95 percent shareholding in OM Asset Management (OMAM) for approximately $446 million in cash, as it proceeds with its managed separation, the company said in a statement released to shareholders on Monday. The sale of the stake to HNA Capital US would reduce Old Mutual s shareholding in OMAM to 25.9 percent. The deal, which is subject to conditions including regulatory clearance, is expected to be completed in two stages: the first within approximately 30 days, the second during the second half of the year. Old Mutual said it was not subject to any lock-up arrangements in respect of its remaining shareholding and intended to continue the reduction of its holding in OMAM in an orderly manner. Bruce Hemphill, Old Mutual chief executive, said the deal represents another step in delivering our managed separation strategy and secures a strategic long-term investor for OMAM .
