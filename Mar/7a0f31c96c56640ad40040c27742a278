A Western Province DA councillor accused of allegedly sexually assaulting a minor was denied bail in Clanwilliam Magistrates&#8217; Court on Friday. DA spokesperson in the Western Cape, Anneke Scheepers, said the man would remain in custody because of the severity of the charge against him. His bail was also dependent on whether he could find an alternative place to live as he had been staying in close proximity to the alleged victim, a 13-year-old girl. Being that he could not as yet provide an alternative address to which he could be released, the bail hearing was postponed until March 29, said Scheepers. The councillor is accused of sexually assaulting the teenager in his office after giving her a lift in his car on Sunday morning. I want to reiterate the DA s position on the matter we do not in any way condone the exploitation of women and children in this manner &#8230; [he] is innocent until proven guilty but should a guilty verdict arise, the DA will act severely against him, she said. The regional spokesperson of the ANC Westcoast region, Sammy Claassen, said the court had made a good decision, taking into account the trauma to both the alleged victim, family and the community. But the DA s lack of action was strongly criticised. We are, however, outraged at the lack of action by the DA, who refused to activate any form of internal disciplinary procedures against [the man]. It seems that the DA does not have a clear understanding of its own constitution, or are too much embarrassed by the conduct of its own. Claassen said the reaction against one of its members smacks of hypocrisy, because we all know that the DA is quick to condemn and discredit its opponents . But when allegations were made against its members, the party was playing hide and seek , he added.
