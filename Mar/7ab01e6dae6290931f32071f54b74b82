The ANC Youth League in the Free State is preparing to nominate Motsoeneng for parliament, replacing Gugile Nkwinti. According to the Sunday Times, chairman of the league Makalo Mohale said Motsoeneng was ready for a role in government and would likely champion the issue of land redistribution. Motsoeneng is pleased about the upcoming nomination, telling the Sunday Times many South Africans supported him. He has in effect been unemployed since a court judgment found he should never have been appointed the chief operating officer of the SABC. &#8220;My support is not just locally, my support is even in the continent. Why? People in the continent talk about me a lot. They write about me. My support is not only from (those structures); there are many people. Even the kings and traditional leaders &#8230; including some churches,&#8221; said Motsoeneng. There is a vacant position after MP Agnes Qikani resigned from parliament. Should the ANC Youth League in the Free State be successful to have Motsoeneng nominated, he could go straight to Cape Town. In an interview, Motsoeneng also said he was ready for a job in government. I want to serve South Africans not political parties. I want to serve the people of South Africa. I want to add value. I want to make sure that people that are black have jobs. I want to make sure even white people they have a place in South Africa, he said.
