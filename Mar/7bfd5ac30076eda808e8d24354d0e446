The South African Policing Union (Sapu) on Tuesday, said they would like to call upon Police Minister Nathi Nhleko to seriously consider overhauling the police crime intelligence division which they we feel has totally collapsed. The so-called illegal mining warfare points clearly to the collapse of the police crime intelligence. Functionary members are more than willing to go an extra mile detecting crime, Sapu spokesperson Oscar Skommere said. It is unfortunate that the crime intelligence is mostly kept busy with partisan political battles within the governing party. Skommere said they call upon Nhleko, to give political leadership in terms of the revival of the crime intelligence division. The first step towards the stabilisation of the crime intelligence is the establishment of its leadership mostly at national level, police seem to be failing to deal with crime effectively because of the lack of capacity of the crime intelligence, said Skommere. It is a well-known fact that they do not have the capacity to deal with illegal mining in South Africa in all fronts, these illegal miners are well ahead of the police in every aspect. Skommere stated that the illegal mining activity in South Africa is an indictment on the police intelligence that is dead. The minister must come to the party and smell the coffee, if the police crime intelligence is not revived criminals will take over the country.
