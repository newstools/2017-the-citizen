Arrogate is to have a well-deserved break before being prepared for back-to-back vic tories in the Breeders&#8217; Cup Classic following his aston ishing display to win the Dubai World Cup at Meydan on Satur day. The Bob Baffert-trained grey produced one of the greatest per formances in the history of horse racing to take the near 5million first prize after facing a near im possible task. The four-year-old, carrying the famous Khalid Abdullah colours also sported by Frankel, was last after being squeezed out at the start and one stage was some 20 lengths behind the leader. Jockey Mike Smith did not panic and going down the back straight worked his way into the race before the turbo kicked in as Arrogate stormed past the leader Gun Runner over 200m out to land an unlikely victory by 2.25 lengths. &#8220;It was an extraordinary per formance. It was one for the ages, as they say,&#8221; said Teddy Grimthor pe, racing manager to the owner. &#8220;So far, he&#8217;s come out of the race fine. &#8220;He&#8217;ll have a break now and aim for the Breeders&#8217; Cup. That will be his main objective. &#8220;Obviously we have to get him back home, see how he is and give him some time to chill and then bring him back with the Breeders&#8217; Cup in mind.&#8221; Meanwhile Postponed is likely to make his next appearance in the Coronation Cup at Epsom after having to make do with mi nor honours when defending his crown in Saturday&#8217;s Dubai Shee ma Classic at Meydan. Roger Varian&#8217;s charge enjoyed a spectacular campaign in 2016, winning the Dubai City of Gold, the Sheema Classic, the Corona tion Cup and the Juddmonte In ternational before finishing fifth in the Arc. Although narrowly beaten in the Dubai City of Gold this time around, hopes were high he could get back on the winning trail on World Cup night, but he could only finish third behind the John Gosden-trained Jack Hobbs and Aidan O&#8217;Brien&#8217;s filly Seventh Heaven. While disappointed, Varian is not despondent and is confident his stable star will enjoy another productive season. &#8220;I suppose after the level he got to last year, you always have high expectations. We&#8217;re disappointed to get beaten, but the more we re flect on it, the more we think he hasn&#8217;t run a bad race at all,&#8221; said the Kremlin House-based trainer. &#8220;Without wanting to make ex cuses, I don&#8217;t think the ground would have suited him, there was also a headwind and a slow pace. &#8220;He just can&#8217;t quicken on that slower ground like he does on quicker ground, but I think you&#8217;ve got to congratulate the winner, who won very well on the night. &#8220;He&#8217;s come out of the race fine. I haven&#8217;t seen him myself but he&#8217;s due to fly back today, so we&#8217;ll see how he is when he gets home. &#8220;He certainly won&#8217;t run before Epsom and we&#8217;d be very keen to get him back for the Coronation Cup again if we can. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;ll bounce back in the summer.&#8221; www.sportinglife.com
