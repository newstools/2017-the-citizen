South African comedian and television host Trevor Noah has made it onto the cover of Time magazine cover for the second time in just over five months. The 33-year-old first appeared on Time s cover in September last year when he shared the limelight with other late-night show hosts in a feature labelled: The partisan politics of late-night comedy. He now graces the March 13 edition cover with a story titled: Next Generation Leaders &#8230; Trevor Noah and nine other stars ready to take over their fields. The article looks at 10 pioneers who cross the boundaries, forge new paths, take their crafts to unexpected places and also improve the world . The host of The Daily Show, in the news earlier this week after he spent R130 million on an apartment in Manhattan last month, has also been on the covers of GQ and Rolling Stone magazines. I inherited a sense of humour from my mom, the ability to laugh in the face of danger, he told Time. My friends say to me, I hope I m never kidnapped with you, because you ll probably get us killed by making fun of the kidnapper , which is true.
