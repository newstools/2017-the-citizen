It s about time cricket s authorities change some of the Code of Laws in the sport. This week the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) announced as from October they will cut down on the size of a bat and give umpires the power to send players off. In recent years, bat sizes have grown to ridiculous dimensions, giving batsmen a distinct advantage over bowlers. Although the introduction of T20 cricket has also played a big role in big scores, one just has to look at how team and individual totals have significantly increased over the years to realise the impact bigger bats have had on the game. In other changes, umpires will be given more powers to punish poor player behaviour, starting with official warnings, through to temporary or permanent dismissal from the field. Offences, including throwing the ball at a player or making deliberate physical contact with an opponent, would result in the immediate awarding of five penalty runs to the opposing team . More serious offences, including intimidating an umpire or threatening to assault another player, team official or spectator, would mean five penalty runs and the offender s removal from the field for a set number of overs . International and domestic cricketers are the role models for our youth. A message that bad behaviour on the field will not be tolerated is a huge step in making sure aspiring cricketers learn the right way to play cricket from a young age.
