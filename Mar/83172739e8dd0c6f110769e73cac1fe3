The Council for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) on Monday began facilitating mediation between the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) and the Bus Passenger Council. This comes after the union last month declared a dispute with the employers after wage negotiations broke down. In a statement, Numsa s general secretary Irvin Jim said workers can no longer afford to survive on starvation wages as employees in this sector workers earn an average of R5,000 per month. It s time for workers in the industry to unite and fight for better pay and an improved quality of life, particularly in this critical time when the government and its partners in business are united in a war against workers, Jim said. Those that say R5,000 is better than nothing, don t care about workers or their living conditions. Numsa is demanding a wage increase of 30% across the board, and is also demanding a living wage of R15,000 per month for all workers. They also demand a R1,500 housing allowance, R1,200 sleeping out allowance, and also want to be paid 1.5 time their normal rate when working overtime and double if forced to work on their day off. However, employers in the bus passenger sector, including companies such as Autopax, Buscor, Putco, Greyhound, Intercape, Golden Arrow, and Mgqibelo, are not moving from their offer of 4.5% wage increase across the board. The facilitation of mediation by the CCMA will end on Thursday. African News Agency For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
