The defence in the trial of Preshalin Naidoo, who was involved in the car crash that killed popular television personality Simba Mhere and his friend Kady-Shay O Bryan, on Monday questioned the accuracy of the evidence given by the state witness from the car-tracking-device company. Naidoo, 24, is on trial in the Randburg Magistrate s Court for the fatal multiple car crash along William Nicol Drive in Fourways, Johannesburg. He faces two charges of culpable homicide. The crash on 31 January 2015 involved three cars. On Monday, defence witness IBF Investigations South Africa chief reconstructionist Stanley Bezuidenhout questioned the accuracy of the evidence supplied by Car Track, which included the speed Naidoo was driving at as well as his overall driver behaviour. Bezuidenhout argued that the data provided by Car Track Fleet Manager Lorenz Stoger was merely files from his computer and not live data, as he was not connected to the internet. It is not protected data, it can be manipulated easily, Bezuidenhout said. State prosecutor Dinesh Nandkissor argued that Bezuidenhout had no place to say Stoger s evidence was manipulated. Earlier, Bezuidenhout told the court that, through his analysis, he couldn t find any evidence of a brake failure in Naidoo s vehicle. Naidoo is on record as saying his car developed a mechanical fault, which caused the accident. However, Bezuidenhout said from observation of the general mechanics of the vehicle that there was no mechanical malfunction detected. Mhere s mother left after Bezuidenhout told the court he wanted to present photographs of the Top Billing presenter s body in the vehicle. The trial continues.
