Saturday may well be April Fool s Day but there will not be any fools lining up for the Grade 1 SA Classic and the Grade 1 Wilgerbosdrift SA Fillies Classic at Turffontein. They are the respective second legs of the R2 million SA Triple Crown and the R1 million Wilgerbosdrift SA Triple Tiara for fillies. Both winners of the first leg, the Betting World Gauteng Guineas and Wilgerbosdrift Gauteng Fillies Guineas, will be lining in their respective second legs. Janoobi, trained by Mike de Kock and ridden by Piere Strydom, showed plenty of guts in holding off the challenge of Al Sahem to win the Guineas while Smiling Blue Eyes from the stable of champion trainer Sean Tarry won the Fillies event impressively, overcoming the widest draw of all. Janoobi is expected to have some problems with the distance but Tarry has high hopes Smiling Blue Eyes will enjoy the extra 200m of the Classic and the 2450m SA Oaks next month to claim the Triple Tiara. Only two fillies have been able to win the R1 million bonus and they are Igugu in 2013 and Cherry On The Top in 2015. Tarry got so close in 2015 when Siren s Call won the first two legs and looked all over a winner in the SA Oaks but was touched off on the line. Hopefully the weather is good as the Country Garden at Turffontein will also offer up wonderful food. Acclaimed restaurateur Thom Hughes is ready to wow racegoers with his culinary delights. Good food done simply. Food that is both easy to handle, affordable yet of the highest standard. The Country Garden will be serving up some of the best food on the day. One lucky person will walk away with R20 000. There are also cash giveaways in the money shower as well as four R5 000 vouchers throughout the day. info: Tickets for the Country Garden are on sale at Webtickets or available at the gate on the day.
