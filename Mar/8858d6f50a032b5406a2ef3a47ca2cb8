Taking to Twitter to speak out on the hot debate that has engulfed Twitter since Sunday, rapper OKmalumkoolkat has finally opted to address being called a &#8216;convicted sex offender&#8217; by City Press. In a string of tweets, the rapper, whose real name is Simiso Zwane, said he was more concerned with protecting his family from the media after he came back from serving a six-month jail sentence in Australia for sexual indecency and assault. While on tour, Zwane walked into a hotel room of a woman he had been travelling with and attempted to grope her, causing her to call the police and report him for sexual assault. He pleaded guilty and served out his sentence, returning late last year to resume his rap career. Before the scandal, Zwane had a budding career and had been featured on Cassper Nyovest&#8217;s album, eventually releasing his new album, Mlazi Milano. AKA enlisted Zwane to design the cover art for his love track, Caiphus Song. On Sunday, City Press ran the headline, AKA collaborates with convicted sex offender Okmalumkoolkat on new cover . While AKA defended Zwane, saying he had paid for his mistake, the rapper kept quiet until today. IT&#39;S NO SECRET, I WAS CONVICTED WITH ASSAULT WITH INTENT OF INDECENCY AND ASSAULT WITH INTENT IN AUSTRALIA WHILE ON TOUR 01/2006 &mdash; #MLAZIMILANO (@okmalumkoolkat) March 8, 2017 His second tweet caused a bit of a stir, with Zwane saying he felt sorry a woman &#8216;felt&#8217; violated. One Twitter user responded that his tweet lacked a sense of accountability because it appeared he was still blaming the woman for feeling violated. &nbsp; @okmalumkoolkat question what does &quot;felt violated&quot; mean? Does it mean you didn&#39;t violate her and it&#39;s all in her feels&#8230;.oro? &mdash; V.S.O.P (@tina_blackrose) March 8, 2017 The reaction to Zwane&#8217;s apology went south from there. Though he kept on tweeting, his fans were less than impressed with his explanation. UNDERSTAND THAT SEXUAL ASSAULT IS PART OF A DISEASE CALLED &#39;RAPE&#39; AND THIS DISEASE PLAGUES THE WHOLE WORLD BUT MUCH MORE WIDESPREAD IN S.A &mdash; #MLAZIMILANO (@okmalumkoolkat) March 8, 2017 I AM A BROKEN MAN FROM THIS BROKEN SOCIETY.
