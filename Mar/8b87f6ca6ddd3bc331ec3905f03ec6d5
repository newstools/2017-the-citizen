Dar es Salaam. Energy companies have focused on onshore exploration.They have minimised their attention to offshore activities while analysing trends in global oil prices.A section of oil and gas operators told BusinessWeek that while onshore activities were taking the lead, their current target was to develop a liquefied natural gas (LNG) project.According to reports, the final investment decision on the $30 billion onshore LNG export terminal will not be made for at least five years and possibly much longer.However, BG Tanzania external relations manager Patricia Mhondo said the company drilled two wells in 2016, but no hydrocarbons were found.Given the volume of hydrocarbons already discovered within blocks 1 and 4 through the drilling of 18 exploration and appraisal wells, BG Tanzania planned to focus on technically evaluating the discoveries and establishing the commercial framework prior to potential future LNG development. We are now developing our discoveries as we focus on the LNG project, she stressed.Statoil Tanzania country manager Oystein Michelsen said companies were looking at onshore activities as opposed to offshore activities in the past.According to him, there have been no new licences for offshore exploration. But he did not go into details because the government was better placed to explain the matter. Since we started exploration in this country our major discovery was block 2 of which our programme is to develop the discoveries as we take keen observation on the LNG project, he said.Statoil plans to take serious engineering work on block 2 including developing the LNG plant.Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation (TPDC) acting managing director Kapuulya Musomba said licences for off shore activities had not been suspended but explorations stopped for a while following the price of petrol declining globally. Our plans this year are to find more gas and oil in various regions of the country by partnering with oil and gas operators, he said.According to him, they are eyeing Rukwa, Morogoro and other regions that have potential for oil and gas.He noted that TPDC was also conducting multiple geological studies and appraising some of the work already in progress.He noted that some of the plans include production.According to reports Tanzania, with 57 trillion cubic feet (tcf), has the second largest natural gas reserves in East Africa. Mozambique leads with 100 tcf.TPDC estimates that the country s gas fields are large enough to cover the domestic power requirements and make Tanzania the next natural gas hub in Africa.
