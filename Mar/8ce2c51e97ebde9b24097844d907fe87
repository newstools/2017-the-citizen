A German sports club is mourning the deaths of two amateur sportsmen who suffered heart attacks on successive days, leaving team-mates wondering if the club is cursed. Last Wednesday, 24-year-old footballer Hannes Rumpker suffered a heart attack while training with his local team in the north-west German town of Edewecht, near Bremen, and later died in hospital. The club, VfL Edewecht, called off a regional league match out of respect. Then on Thursday, Arne Hobbie, 33, who played for and ran the club s basketball team, Edewecht Wattworms, also suffered a heart attack while training. He was revived by emergency services, but later died in hospital. Like the grieving footballers before them, the mourning basketball team also called off a key match, which would have decided promotion. The tiny town of Edewecht, which has a population of 21,000, is in shock. For us, the whole thing is still completely surreal, Hobbie s team-mate Henning von Aschwege told regional newspaper Nordwest Zeitung. After the death of Hannes, it s like a curse is hanging over us. Club official Ute Meinen added: We have never experienced such a thing before. We do not really know how to deal with the situation.
