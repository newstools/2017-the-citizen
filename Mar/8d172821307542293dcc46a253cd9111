&#8220;We don&#8217;t get our constituency funding &#8230; all the funds are centralised from head office. This is a serious concern that seems to divide the organisation. We can&#8217;t do any work in provinces and communities because of this,&#8221; a member of the EFF&#8217;s highest decision-making body, the central command team told Sunday Times. In addition to being unsatisfied with the handling of party funds among provinces, other concerns have been raised such as that of councillors and MPs paying up to 50 and 30% of their salaries to the EFF. This has led to pre-planning for Shivambu to be elected party leader in 2019 according to party insiders. &#8220;Most people can&#8217;t speak out when they have serious concerns. Now there is a sort of cold war, resulting in provinces trying to pronounce themselves on succession,&#8221; a source said. Shivambu has dismissed the report that an early succession battle is already brewing withing the party, saying it was &#8216;pure craziness.&#8217; &#8220;EFF is allocated resources by parliament and the legislatures. It is accounted for nationally. Provinces have to make submissions centrally &#8230; we can&#8217;t decentralise resources. There is never any irregularity, we have the cleanest of audits,&#8221; he added.
