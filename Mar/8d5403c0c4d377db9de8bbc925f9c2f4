A 45-year-old man was sentenced to life imprisonment by the Moretele Regional Court for repeatedly raping his 15-year-old daughter. The Hammanskraal resident, whose identity cannot be revealed to protect the rape victim, was sentenced on Monday following his arrest early last year, Rekord North reported. Police spokesperson Herman Moremi said the teen had earlier confided in her teacher that her father continually raped her. She said her father raped her every morning before she went to school when her mother was not around, said Moremi. The man had even taken her to the family planning clinic to put her on contraceptives. After his arrest, the father alleged that the matter was discussed with his wife who consented that since the girl had started dating boys, then the father should also sleep with her, said Moremi. The man was sentenced to life after he pleaded guilty to the rape charge. The abuse had continued over a two-year period and started before the girl turned 15. During the trial, which went on for several weeks, the teen had given evidence on camera. &#8211; Caxton News Service For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
