President Jacob Zuma has officially appointed Setlhomamaru Dintwe as the South Africa s new Inspector-General on Intelligence, effective from March 15. In a statement on Monday, Zuma s office said the president had appointed Dintwe for a period of five years in terms of section 7 (1) of the Intelligence Oversight Act. The said Act provides that the President shall appoint an Inspector-General of Intelligence nominated by the Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence and approved by the National Assembly by a resolution supported by at least two thirds of its members, the presidency said. Dr Dintwe is currently employed by the University of South Africa as an Associate Professor of Forensic at College of Law, School of Criminal Justice. The I-G on Intelligence post has been vacant for almost two years after the term of Faith Radebe came to an end in April 2015. The process to nominate an I-G was stopped and started several times. The ANC s original choice, Cecil Burgess, who oversaw the processing of the controversial Protection of State Information Bill, was rejected by opposition parties. The nomination of the Inspector-General of Intelligence post needs a two-thirds majority in the National Assembly to pass. On November 29 last year, most political parties, barring the Economic Freedom Fighters, voted in favour of Dintwe s nomination.
