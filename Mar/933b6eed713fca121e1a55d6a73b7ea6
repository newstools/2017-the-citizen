The Gauteng Cricket Board have noted with sadness the passing of Ahmed Kathrada, South African politician and former political prisoner and anti-apartheid activist. Kathrada was widely known for his love of the game of cricket, and it is especially his commitment to the youth of this country that stood out for GCB president Jack Madiseng. Uncle Kathy, as he was fondly known, had a deep belief that our country could be great and that the biggest potential lies within the youth. He devoted his life to supporting youth empowerment initiatives, amongst the other great things that he accomplished. Cricket as a whole has enjoyed his support over the years, but it was especially his involvement with the Lenasia Premier League and his devotion to nonracialism that had an incredible impact on so many young cricketers lives. It is a deeply humbling experience to be able to pay tribute to a life lived for the betterment of others by someone who was the epitome of selflessness and who cared for others in the most sincere manner. The Gauteng Cricket Board salutes his life as a phenomenal human being and hope that his legacy will continue to inspire the masses. We can certainly all do with a little more of Uncle Kathy in us.
