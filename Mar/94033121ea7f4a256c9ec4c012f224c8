South Africa possibly losing the bid to host the 2022 Commonwealth Games due to financial challenges has led to a twar between sports presenter Robert Marawa and Minister of Sports and Recreation Fikile Mbalula. It started off with Marawa responding to the announcement made on Twitter, saying the loss was imminent as Mbalula&#8217;s department was busy acting like &#8220;Tarzan&#8221;, a comment Marawa made because he was being vindictive, according to Mbalula. Why would he equate the department to Tarzan? Mbalula asked. He further advised Marawa to get over his &#8220;hangover&#8221; because life was just too short. Marawa never believed in the country hosting the Games, said Mbalula, who further told Marawa to study the facts first before &#8220;blowing his usual hot air&#8221; on the matter. But, according to Marawa, blowing hot air is usually what Mbalula&#8217;s department does. And then, he calls the Department Tarzans and when we respond to that it&#39;s an attack ? pic.twitter.com/hGg3S714b5 &mdash; RSA Min of Sport (@MbalulaFikile) February 28, 2017 The twar stopped being about the Games, with Marawa accusing Mbalula of trying to get him fired from Metro FM. &#8220;Why would I want you to get fired? Smh, you should have long been fired, I defended you. Don&#8217;t digress,&#8221; said Mbalula. He told Marawa to go to his archives and check that he defended him from getting fired when he was still ANCYL president. &#8220;Amnesia won&#8217;t assist,&#8221; Mbalula said. When someone you&#39;ve defended against firing far back when you were a President of ANCYL before you became a Minister says you want him gone pic.twitter.com/DLiFCHZRcg &mdash; RSA Min of Sport (@MbalulaFikile) February 28, 2017 Mbalula implied in a press conference on Tuesday that Durban s chances of hosting 2022 s event, which features various sporting codes, had all but disappeared. I don t want to raise your expectations and say everything looks good it doesn t, he said according to various reports. We are unable to agree on the fundamentals. There s a possibility that the Commonwealth Games will be out of the window.&#8221; We can t find each other on the final figures,&#8221; said Mbalula.
