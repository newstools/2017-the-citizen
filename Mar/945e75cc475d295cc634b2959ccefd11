Montpellier s South African coach Jake White said Tuesday he is ready to retake the helm of his national side, which he led to glory at the 2007 World Cup. Current South Africa coach Allister Coetzee oversaw a catastrophic 2016 season but last week his federation gave him a vote of confidence despite a record of eight defeats in 12 tests that year.

Apparently a series loss to France in June would his final straw with rumours doing the rounds that the Springboks actually need to achieved 3-0 series clean-sweep. White is scheduled to quit Montpellier, who are third in the French top flight, at the end of the current Top 14 campaign in June. &#8220;I would like to be involved in international rugby again,&#8221; 53-year-old White told South African TV in an interview recorded before Coetzee was retained. &#8220;Any guy who has competed at the highest level will tell you that s where you measure yourself,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I was lucky enough to have some success. And as a guy that s been involved in the Boks and more importantly measured in test rugby, it s something that I&#8217;d like to get back into.&#8221; White will be replaced by Scotland coach Vern Cotter in June, just ahead of France s tour.
