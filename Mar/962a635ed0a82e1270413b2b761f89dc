Kunene has said &#8216;I do&#8217; for the second time to Nkululeko Mhlanga in Northern Cape. According to Sunday Sun, over 200 guests witnessed the umabo ceremony. Self-proclaimed blesser Serge Cabonge attended the wedding. Kunene was welcomed by Mhlanga&#8217;s family and the ceremony resumed at Seperepere Conversion Centre. Kenny, 46, met the 22-year-old Mhlanga four years ago and knew instantly that she was the one, though he had doubts about the age gap between them. But it was Mhlanga s maturity that made him realise age would not be a problem. For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
