Isibaya has never disappointed when it comes to having a solid plot, and the award-winning drama continues to serve up drama-filled episodes with the Zungu family going up against the Ndlovus and Ngwenyas. Since Menzi Ngubane joined last year, playing Judas, the show has taken a dramatic twist with Judas&#8217; daughter Zama falling in love with the son of her family&#8217;s nemesis, the Zungus. Their love story has seen Zama and Jabu keep their romance a secret, fight over their families, face rejection and eventually end up at the Zungu household, with Zama in hiding from her bloodthirsty dad. Last night&#8217;s episode saw Judas and his son Qhapela head over to the Zungu homestead to fetch Zama. Viewers watched as Zama, played by Linda Mtoba, was dragged by her borther, kicking and screaming helplessly. Isibaya is nominated in the best soapie category for the upcoming SA Film and Television Awards. #isibaya producers&#39; after last night&#39;s episode pic.twitter.com/qojEjgOYvo &mdash; Khwezidashian (@Khwezidashian) March 3, 2017 #Isibaya Tonight pic.twitter.com/C1Pduiceex &mdash; B R I A N (@MarkBrian_M) March 2, 2017 #Isibaya is one of this country&#39;s best productions.
