Mike de Kock has entered Dubai World Cup fourth Mubtaahij in the Audemars Piguet HK$20-million QEII Cup over 2000m at Sha Tin on April 30. De Kock won the race with Irridescence in 2006 and Archipenko in 2008. Should five-year-old Mubtaahij, who finished second to California Chrome in the Meydan showpiece last year, go to Hong Kong for the R33.34-million race, he will be taking on three past winners of the race, including Werther, who was impressive last year. Fifty-one horses have been entered, with Hong Kong also represented by Designs On Rome (QEII Cup winner in 2014) and Blazing Speed (2015 winner), while Werther&#8217;s stablemate Rapper Dragon, the first horse to complete a clean sweep of Hong Kong&#8217;s Four-Year-Old Classic Series could be put to the test in this International Group 1 race. Japan struck gold twice at December&#8217;s Hong Kong International Races and could play a big role again, with last year&#8217;s Group 1 Hong Kong Vase (2400m) winner Satono Crown prominent in the entries. Also engaged is Group 1 Dubai Turf (1800m) winner Real Steel, 2015 QEII Cup runner-up Staphanos and Group 2 winners Neorealism, Yamakatsu Ace and Admire Deus. Australia also has a number of horses entered, including Group 1 Caulfield Cup (2400m) winner Jameka and Group 1 Turnbull Stakes (2000m) victor Hartnell. Hartnell is owned by Godolphin, who has another entry in the form of Group 1 Epsom Handicap (1600m) winner Hauraki. The United States, winner of the 2016 Group 1 Ranvet Stakes (2000m) and 2016 Group 1 Australian Derby (2400m) winner Tavago are also nominated. Group 1 Arlington Million (2000m) winner Mondialiste heads up the European contingent that also has two Ballydoyle big guns, three-time Group 1 scorer Alice Springs and Group 1 Belmont Derby (2000m) winner Deauville.
