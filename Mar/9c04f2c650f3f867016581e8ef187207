Judge President of the Gauteng Division of the High Court Dunstan Mlambo has expressed sadness at the death last week of former judge Jacobus Pierre Roux. Roux served as a High Court judge of the Gauteng division from 1986 until his retirement in 2003. Roux was born on January 13, 1933 in Pretoria, where he lived his entire life. He matriculated at Pretoria Boys High and graduated from Stellenbosch University in 1955 with a BA LLB degree, Mlambo s office said in a statement. He was admitted as an advocate in 1956 and took Silk in 1977. Notably, he was also admitted as an advocate in the High Court of Botswana in June 1976. During 1982 and 1983 he was appointed as an acting judge at the then Transvaal provincial division of the Supreme Court. In 1986 he was permanently appointed as a judge of the same High Court, Pretoria. Roux also acted as a judge at the Bophuthatswana High Court in Mmabatho during February 2002. He was discharged from active service on January 14, 2003, at the age of 70 with just over 17 years of active service on the bench. He is survived by his four children Charles, Pierre, Andrew, and Nan and seven grandchildren. His eldest son, two of his daughters-in-law, and his son-in-law all followed in his footsteps in the legal profession as advocates. For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
