A man of many talents, EFF spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi showed off his singing skills when he uploaded a video of Malema and Ndlozi singing in the background on to his social pages. We&#8217;ve always known Ndlozi has an impressive voice, and he has broken into song a few times. Malema is celebrating his 36th birthday today, and birthday wishes have been rolling in.
