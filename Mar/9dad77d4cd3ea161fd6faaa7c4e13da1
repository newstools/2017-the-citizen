There is a very real possibility that social welfare grant recipients could not be paid by April 1. Times LIVE reports that in his response to legal papers, CPS CEO Serge Belamant said that if his company&#8217;s contract with Sassa was not sorted out by Wednesday, social grants would not be paid. Yet in his letter court Belamant warns &#8220;CPS will not be in a position to commence payment on 1 April&#8221;. Belamant writes: &#8220;It is imperative that Sassa understands the time frames required for the logistical planning with specific reference to the cash cycle. I attach hereto a schedule of the time frame as well as the activities to facilitate this planning and ensure uninterrupted grant delivery.&#8221; ALSO READ: Bathabile Dlamini: social grants crisis just propaganda by opposition For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
