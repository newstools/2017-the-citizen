Robert Marawa celebrated his birthday on Wednesday, and his bae, Pearl Thusi, had the sweetest words to say to him. Taking to Twitter she called him the greatest man in the world of sports and a gem to the hearts of Africans, &#8220;and an all-round amazing man&#8221;, she said. The sports presenter turned 44. &#8220;Thank you for always being honest to those who listen to you, watch you and even those around and closest to you. We pray you have an incredible day and many more to come. There is truly no one like you. So talented yet so hardworking and with a heart to back it up,&#8221; she said.

Marawa responded, thanking her for the sweet birthday message. &#8220;I will continue to attend the classes that you conduct on how to be amazing,&#8221; he said. It must have been a special day for the sports presenter, as even his bae&#8217;s best friend, DJ Zinhle, had something cute to say. Apparently, Kairo had been singing the birthday song all morning yesterday. Also read: You tried to get me fired, Marawa tells Mbalula
