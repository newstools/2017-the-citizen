Speaking to TshisaLIVE, Mboro, who is the owner of End Times Disciples Ministries church on the East Rand says he believes that Grace Bible Church should have hosted the memorial for free because that is the Christ like thing to do. A furore erupted when actor Mangaliso Ngema tweeted about how the Mafela family could not afford R89 000 quoted by the Soweto-based church. They opted to have the memorial at the Joburg Theatre on Thursday. &#8220;The church can say that there are overhead costs that need to be paid for, but it would have been a good thing to give support to the family. This was a traumatic incident that the family was not prepared for, and they obviously do not have that kind of money to pay. The right thing to do would be to help them not kick them out on the street,&#8221; Mboro told TshisaLIVE. He said his church helped people who could not afford memorials and funerals. Not assisting the poor led to people having to wait to raise funds to bury their loved ones. &#8220;As a church we represent Christ, and we help people in need, as Christ would have. We must just give,&#8221; Mboro said. ALSO READ: Family, friends celebrate Joe Mafela s life and legacy For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
