As speculation mounts on whether President Jacob Zuma will fire Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan in coming days, a convoy of ministers&#8217; cars was seen leaving the Union Buildings on Wednesday night following a Cabinet meeting. The meeting, which is said to take place twice a month on Wednesdays, comes in the wake of mounting speculation that Zuma is set to fire Gordhan and his deputy Mcebisi Jonas. No word emerged on what transpired during the meeting. Earlier this week, Zuma sent shockwaves when he recalled the duo while they were on a roadshow aimed at attracting potential investors. It remained unclear why they were recalled, as the Presidency remained mum on the issue, but reports suggested a Cabinet reshuffle was on the cards and that Gordhan was set to get the axe. According to numerous reports, Zuma allegedly revealed his reasons for wanting to fire Gordhan to the ANC&#8217;s top six. TimesLive reports that Gordhan&#8217;s recall had to do with an intelligence report the president received which claimed the minister and his deputy were using the now-cancelled roadshow as a way to reach out to influential people hellbent on &#8220;overthrowing the State&#8221;. Zuma is said to have used this as an excuse to fire Gordhan, expressing concerns over the minister&#8217;s close relationship with such people. However, the ANC&#8217;s top six is said to be divided on the issue, with Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe and treasurer Zweli Mkhize reportedly against Gordhan&#8217;s removal. A spokesperson for the state security department denied any knowledge of the alleged report on Gordhan. #Cabinet meeting is sad to have been a routine meeting that happens twice a month on Wednesdays. #VK pic.twitter.com/EDD5Z9jzUW &mdash; Virginia Keppler (@VKeppler) March 29, 2017 #Cabinet meeting, pres.
