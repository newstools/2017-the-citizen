While hatred for and visceral fear of Muslims began long before President Donald Trump s campaign hatched, his odious rhetoric and reckless decisions promise a potentially horrifying climax.Given Trump s intentions for a Muslim ban and the fury his followers harbour for Islam, the backdrop for Islam in America right now consists of white nationalist fliers on college campuses, grisly hate crimes, tenuous civil liberties and profound suspicion. Friends and family fear that anything appearing remotely Muslimy will provoke malice.There are also concerns that the clash of civilisations sought by Trump s advisers will embolden groups like the Islamic State, which seek those disaffected by the West as recruits.Trump s presidency has become a moment of reckoning for the country s 3.3 million Muslims as their faith finds itself embattled, besieged by uncertainty and under duress. Muslims face a temptation to embrace victimhood and retreat, but also a solace, as Islam has been in a similar place before.In the dusty pages of old Sunday school books are the stories of early Muslim communities that thrived when their faith was beset with challenges. Propelled forward by the universal themes of justice, equality and solidarity that form the Koran s bedrock, their enlightened struggle resonates under Trump s presidency.Born in 610, Islam s call for social and economic reform became a radical response to the growing inequities in the city of Mecca. Long honoured tribal ideals had perished as wealth became disproportionately concentrated in the hands of a few oligarchs who controlled the city and all of its political, religious and economic affairs.The only choiceIn God s eyes, justice is never a matter of choice, but the only choice. The pursuit of justice then becomes a means of showing devotion and demonstrating commitment to God, a duty.In his letter from Mecca in 1964, Malcolm X wrote of how Islam s belief in the oneness of God had bred equality within the religion s adherents. After years of being hardened by America s racism, oppression and exploitation, he was heartened to see a world in which justice was manifested as love and brotherhood:Slept on the same rug During the past eleven days here in the Muslim world, I have eaten from the same plate, drunk from the same glass, and slept on the same rug - while praying to the same God - with fellow Muslims, whose eyes were the bluest of blue, whose hair was the blondest of blond, and whose skin was the whitest of white. And in the words and in the deeds of the white Muslims, I felt the same sincerity that I felt among the black African Muslims of Nigeria, Sudan and Ghana.We were truly all the same (brothers) - because their belief in one God had removed the white from their minds, the white from their behaviour, and the white from their attitude. It is this same spirit that animated 20 rabbis who were arrested while demonstrating against the Muslim ban in front of the Trump Tower in Manhattan and that inspired evangelical Christian leaders to condemn Trump s executive order for giving preference to Christian refugees over Muslim ones.Poses challengesWhile Trump poses challenges for Muslims, his presidency also presents opportunity as we adopt the struggles of our neighbours and marry them to our individual struggles.Every instance of police brutality, an arrival of an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent at a door extends the opportunity to strengthen forge new alliances.As American poet Emma Lazarus wrote, Until we are all free, we are none of us free. Actually, there is perhaps no better time to be a Muslim in America.This article first appeared in Washington Post
