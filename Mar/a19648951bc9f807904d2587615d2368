2017 has started off with a bang for the comedian and TV host after he launched his autobigraphy and bought a luxury New York three-bedroom pad worth R130 million. Trevor has covered Time magazine, one of a select few to do so. Now, news has just come in that his show has gained viewership since he took over from Jon Stewart. It appears Trevor is going down very well with American viewers who were expected to be a tough crowd to pull in. According to US audience measurement system The Nielsen Company, The Daily Show managed to attract more than 1.5 million viewers in February. The number was up 17% from the year before. &#8220;February was The Daily Show&#8216;s most-watched and highest-rated month ever among total viewers. It continues to dominate among Comedy Central s core, key millennial audience, finishing February as the most watched and highest-rated daily late night talk show among all millennials,&#8221; Comedy Central said in a statement.
