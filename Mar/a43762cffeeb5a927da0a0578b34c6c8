Local hero and defending champion Charl Schwartzel was struck on the left wrist by a golf ball and withdrew from a pro-am after 10 holes ahead of Thursday s start of the PGA Valspar Championship. A ball struck by one of Schwartzel s amateur playing partners on the first hole bounced off a tree and hit the 2011 Masters champion, causing his wrist to swell and his hand to go numb briefly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve played golf for 28 years now and I&#8217;ve never been hit by a golf ball until this morning,&#8221; Schwartzel said. &#8220;It was a bit of a fluke. Really bad luck.&#8221; With ice and painkillers, Schwartzel was confident he would make his scheduled morning start alongside two-time Masters champion Bubba Watson of the United States and Sweden s sixth-ranked Henrik Stenson, the reigning British Open champion. &#8220;I&#8217;m planning on playing, whether I have to limp around or not,&#8221; Schwartzel said. &#8220;I just hope it s not something serious because I feel like I&#8217;m playing really well. I don t want to have to sit out because of this silly injury.&#8221; Schwartzel, hoping to become the event s first back-to-back winner, is especially anxious to get more rounds played with the Masters less than a month away. A sore left knee has limited his play so far this year. &#8220;I struggled with my knee a little at the end of the year, and it never really got better, so by the time it came to January for my MRI scan, it turned out I needed a longer break,&#8221; Schwartzel said. &#8220;That has actually allowed me to be a lot fresher than I think I would have been, to sort out some of my clubs and get some practice done to get my game in shape. I think overall it s been a good thing. It was nine weeks &#8230; and it s the freshest I&#8217;ve ever been.&#8221; Schwartzel missed the cut in Malaysia and last month at Riviera, but challenged for a top-10 finish last week before a closing 75 left him sharing 38th at the World Golf Championships event in Mexico City. &#8220;My game feels in really good shape, Schwartzel said. I&#8217;m really just starting out my year. I&#8217;ve worked hard. Swing really feels good. Putting well. I just need some rounds. I really need to start playing some golf.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
