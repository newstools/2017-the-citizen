Dar es Salaam. It was drama that gripped the entertainment industry early November 2016 when the MTV EMA announced Wizkid as the winner of the Africa act category.And as it turned out the true winner of that category was Tanzania s AliKiba, the announcement set the social media ablaze as his followers both locally and elsewhere accused organisers of double standards. After a series of back and forth communication between the singer s team led by Christine Mosha aka Seven and the awards committee, organises admitted the mistake and gave the award to the rightful winner AliKiba.His arrival at the Julius Nyerere International Airport was one of a kind as hundreds of young people who form his fan base turned up to welcome the self proclaimed King of Bongo Flava.Speaking on his return from his tour in South Africa AliKiba said that the award was delayed due to a tight that came towards the festive season. It is true that it took us some time to bring this award home but there was no need for hurry because we had been announced as winners already, he told a gathering at a welcome dinner in Dar es Salaam.In another development singer Ali Kiba left the country yesterday morning for the US where he is expected to stage five concerts as part of his tour.After the US performances the singer who last week released the remix of Aje is expected to return home for preparations for his European tour later in the year.
