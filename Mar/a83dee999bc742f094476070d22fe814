Cassper is maintaining his composure after he came under fire from AKA last week, who rubbished his claims that he was a &#8216;king&#8217;, saying good music would last while everything else wouldn&#8217;t. The two were battling it out for the top spot on iTunes after AKA&#8217;s single, &#8216;The World is Yours&#8217; held the top spot for weeks and was temporariily dethroned by Cassper&#8217;s &#8216;Tito Mboweni&#8217;. This week, Cassper had to contend with iFani also taking shots at him, implying that he didn&#8217;t make proper hip-hop. iFani told his Twitter followers they should rather download Nasty C&#8217;s &#8216;Hell Naw&#8217;. Cassper finally responded on Wednesday evening, saying he would not be drawn into commenting. &#8220;I&#8217;m a musician, I make music. I&#8217;m not a tweleb. If I have something to say, it&#8217;ll be on my album,&#8221; he added.
