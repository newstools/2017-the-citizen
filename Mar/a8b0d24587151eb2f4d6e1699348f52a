The Methode Cap Classique and champagne festival in Pretoria on Friday and Saturday was a great success. Just to be on the safe side and to avoid potential wet weather, the functions took place on the top floor of Brooklyn Square in Pretoria. And what would bubbly be without some fabulous food to accompany it? Catering was courtesy of award-winning chef Vanessa Marx, who provided a range of marvellous meals, including pulled pork buns, crispy sesame chicken on Asian slaw with sticky glaze; no-carb noodles with chicken, basil pesto, sundried tomatoes and feta (for the banters), bacon and cheese beef burgers; various bruschetta with roast beef and mustard, smoked trout and cream cheese and mozzarella, marinated tomato, basil and capers, and cheese and meat boards. Mini doughnuts and affogato rounded off the meal in style. We wanted to provide a range of dishes that are not only hearty and comforting, but stylish and classy, Marx said. There was live music from musicians Dylan Live and Jared Coetzee. Brooklyn Bubbles allows guests to sample some of South Africa s best Methode Cap Classiques, as well as some of France s finest champagnes. said organiser Darielle Robertson.
