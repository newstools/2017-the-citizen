by Steven GRIFFITHS Kane struck twice as Pochettino&#8217;s side closed the gap on Premier League leaders Chelsea to seven points with a 3-2 win over Everton at White Hart Lane on Sunday. Having taken his goal tally for the season to 24 in 28 appearances, Kane expressed disappointment he hadn&#8217;t managed a fourth hat-trick in his last 10 games. Kane&#8217;s ruthless attitude mirrors Pochettino&#8217;s own steely desire for success, so it was no surprise to hear the Spurs boss outline his plan for overhauling Chelsea. &#8220;I&#8217;m a little disappointed with the way we finished, but we dominated for a long time against a team with very good players,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The most important thing is to show on the pitch that we believe. Today we showed that. It&#8217;s better than talking about it. &#8220;We need to be there. It&#8217;s not up to us of course, but if we keep going in this way maybe we will achieve our goal in the end if Chelsea fail. &#8220;It&#8217;s true it&#8217;s not easy for teams to come here with the way we are playing at the moment. &#8220;We feel very confident. It&#8217;s a special moment. The feeling is very good. For us it&#8217;s important to keep that for the future.&#8221; With Kane in such unstoppable form, Pochettino has every right to dream of catching Chelsea, who must win at West Ham on Monday to restore their 10-point advantage. Kane&#8217;s hot streak underlines why Pochettino ranks him alongside the world&#8217;s best strikers and the Argentine gave a revealing insight into the England international&#8217;s work ethic. &#8211; Fantastic asset &#8211; &#8220;He makes a lot of double sessions, he is professional, takes care of himself and because of that he is fresh,&#8221; said Pochettino, whose side have won a club record nine successive home league games. &#8220;It is about the consistency of his training. To be fresh you need to work hard everyday. If you just eat and sleep maybe you are like me, you are fat! &#8220;He had a big chance for a hat-trick. He was a little bit upset. When you have the chance to kill the opponent you have to score. &#8221; &#8220;He is in a very good level but not only now, if you watch him from when he started to play regularly in the Premier League, his stats are unbelievable. He is a fantastic asset to have. He has showed he&#8217;s one of the best strikers.&#8221; Everton manager Ronald Koeman was frustrated his team made sloppy mistakes for Kane&#8217;s second goal and Dele Alli&#8217;s late third. And while he conceded Tottenham were worthy winners, he doesn&#8217;t believe the north Londoners will pip Chelsea to the title. &#8220;Overall Tottenham were the better team. You know if you make the mistakes we did for the second and third goals you won&#8217;t get a point,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This is the third season of Pochettino at Tottenham. You can see a lot of his daily training work in the team. If we get that time at Everton we can do the same. &#8220;Tottenham is really strong and have a difficult system to play against. &#8220;But it will be very difficult because of the distance in points. I think Chelsea is too strong for the rest.&#8221;
