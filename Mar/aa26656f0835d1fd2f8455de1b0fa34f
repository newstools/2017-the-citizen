Police in the Eastern Cape arrested a 32-year old man on Friday for the possession of an unlicensed firearm, 40 rounds of ammunition and drugs worth thousands of rands. Police spokesperson Colonel Sibongile Soci said an intelligence-driven operation was conducted in the Lusikisiki area by members of Crime Intelligence and the Public Order Policing Unit. Soci said the suspect was found in possession of an unlicensed firearm with 40 rounds of ammunition, drugs with an estimated street value of R11 790 and cash. The firearm will be sent for ballistic testing to determine if it has not been used in the commissioning of crime, she said. Police believe the suspect is part of the Amavongo gang operating and tormenting communities in Lusikisiki. The Eastern Cape provincial commissioner, Lieutenant-General Liziwe Ntshinga, welcomed the arrest and said that all leads would be followed up and evidence would be obtained to confirm the possible involvement of the suspect in other crimes in the area. The suspect will appear in the Lusikisiki Magistrates&#8217; Court soon. African News Agency For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
