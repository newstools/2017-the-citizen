We are only entering round five of this year s Super Rugby and the injuries are already starting to pile up for the South African franchises. To say the southern hemisphere rugby tournament is gruelling is an understatement. In the past, many teams title aspirations have been derailed by injuries to key players. Teams need a fair share of luck when it comes to injuries if they are to progress deep into the competition. This week, the Lions were rocked by injuries. Centre Lionel Mapoe is expected to face a lengthy period on the sidelines due to a hairline hand fracture, fullback Jaco van der Walt (foot) will be out for two months and prop Johannes Jonker had concussion. But most serious of all, prop Dylan Smith is out for the campaign due to a shoulder injury. Howard Mnisi s knee injury also ruled him out for the season. The Stormers have also been hit hard, particularly in the backline. Huw Jones, ruled out for the season, didn t even play Super Rugby after injuring his hamstring in Six Nations action. He joins fellow midfielders Juan de Jongh and Damian de Allende on the sidelines, while flyhalf Jean-Luc du Plessis (pelvic bone stress injury), Cheslin Kolbe (ankle sprain) and Jano Vermaak (calf strain) have all missed game time. For the Sharks, captain Pat Lambie is still out for some time with a back injury, while the Kings have lost skipper Schalk Ferreira. The Cheetahs have also had to contend with a spate of injuries. Although Sergeal Petersen and captain Francois Venter are back today, injuries to Nico Lees, Ox Nche, Raymond Rhule and Clinton Swart has had a devastating impact on their campaign. Backrower Uzair Cassiem has spent time on the sidelines while lock Reniel Hugo is out for the remainder of the season. Should this trend continue, it could be an extremely long season for South African teams. For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
