Sushi King Kenny Kunene took to Twitter on Tuesday night to say that he had just come from the police station where someone had lodged an extortion case against a woman that involved allegedly false claims of rape. According to Kunene, &#8220;bitches&#8221; on social media and in night clubs are seducing men and having sex with them, only to then apparently demand money in exchange for not laying a charge of rape against them. &#8220;Gents BEWARE of extortion scam by bitches on social media n clubs who seduce n have sex wit u,demand money if u don&#8217;t pay they claim rape,&#8221; he wrote.

My friends n clients are falling victim to these extortionists. I am from a police station again today to see someone who fell prey to this &mdash; Kenny Kunene (@Kenny_T_Kunene) March 7, 2017 Kunene advised men to be aware that a woman smiling at them might have bad intentions, particularly at night clubs. &#8220;BEWARE BROTHERS,&#8221; he advised. Gents NOT every woman who smiles at you has good intentions especially at a club. That is a deadly smile&#8230;BEWARE BROTHERS &mdash; Kenny Kunene (@Kenny_T_Kunene) March 7, 2017 He denied that he has himself fallen prey to such an extortion scam, since he doesn&#8217;t get excited when a woman seduces him any more, and he runs &#8220;away very quickly&#8221;. No not me. I saw them coming long time ago. I no more get excited when a woman seduces me. I run away very quickly https://t.co/QUtGEZPkpT &mdash; Kenny Kunene (@Kenny_T_Kunene) March 7, 2017 One user joked that Kunene should be happy that he still gets seduced. Another referenced Kunene&#8217;s history of eating sushi off naked women&#8217;s bodies. @Kenny_T_Kunene They&#39;ll be wanting Sushi eaten off their naked bellys,don&#39;t read too much into hehe &mdash; iQuant (@masango1) March 7, 2017 Clifford Bembe wanted to know if this was simply &#8220;new tactics of prostitution? They must get jobs period instead of selling indirectly.&#8221; Kunene&#8217;s new wife would probably be happy to know about how he now runs away from all those women who smile at him. He once made headlines for declaring that he was dating more than 20 women at the same time. The businessman announced recently that he is tying the knot this month with his long-time 22-year-old girlfriend, Nonkululeko Whitney Mhlanga, in a traditional ceremony to be held in Kimberley. Kenny also announced Mhlanga was expecting a baby boy a first child for her and the fourth for him. He has defended against recent criticism of the huge age gap between the two, saying that it has always been &#8220;traditional&#8221; and &#8220;cultural&#8221; for older men to marry younger women in Africa.
