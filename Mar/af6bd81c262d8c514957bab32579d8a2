Lerato Manaka, a brand manager from Roodepoort, in Johannesburg, has claimed that reality show star and musician Penny Penny owes her over R200 000 for the work she did for him. The 34-year-old woman said she started working with Penny Penny on his reality TV show, Papa Penny Ahee, in July last year. The agreement between the two, according to the woman, was for her to get 20% of endorsements, as she apparently got him sponsors for the show. What hurt Manaka most, Daily Sun reports, was that Penny Penny blocked her on WhatsApp in January, allegedly sending her threatening messages and bullying her. She told the tabloid she had tried to work the issue out with Penny Penny in private, to no avail, and now her lawyers have advised her to go to DStv to stop the show. The musician, however, denied owing Manaka money. He reportedly told the tabloid he did not sign any contract with her, as he did not know English. He accused Manaka of trying to scam him. However, Daily Sun said it was in possession of the contract Penny Penny denied signing.
