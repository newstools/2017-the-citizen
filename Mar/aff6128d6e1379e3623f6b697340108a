Dar es Salaam. The business community has identified issues that should be addressed to achieve Tanzania s industrialisation goal.The country targets to become a middle-income economy by 2025 as stipulated in its vision for that year and the contribution of manufacturing is expected to account for a minimum of 40 per cent of the gross domestic product.The government of President John Magufuli has declared that it is crucial to transform the nation into an industrial economy by 2020.To achieve the vision, Tanzania aims to transform itself from being dominated by natural resource exploitation activities and extractive industries (agriculture, tourism and mining) to become an economy with a broad and diverse base of manufacturing, processing and packaging industries that will lead both the productive as well as the export trade sector. Foreign direct investment inflows are expected to provide the capital for the desired industrial development.However, the private sector which is basically expected to drive the industrialisation says much is yet to be done to achieve the targets.Speaking during a live show called Kipima Joto broadcast by a local television channel ITV last Friday, Confederation of Tanzania Industries (CTI) and Tanzania Private Sector Foundation (TPSF) representatives idenfitied issues that should be tackled as the future remains bright for industrialisation.The two were also joined by economics and business researcher Bravious Kahyoza from Kampala International University.Ranging from financing policies, infrastructure patterns, taxation, importation and predictability of policies, they asked the government to play its role by creating a conducive environment for the private sector to exploit potential of industrialisation.TPSF membership services director Louis Accaro said the government has good policies and strategies for industrialisation but unfortunately the financing aspect of implementing those plans was not reflected in the Budget. The government has very well written plans and strategies for industrialisation but we don t see anything in the budget to financing them, he said.He also said that Tanzania has little power generation with about 1,500 megawatts as the national installed capacity. The government targets at least 10,000 MW come 2025. When we talk of industrialisation, power is very key and 1,500MW are not enough, he added.He also mentioned taxation as another challenge facing the private sector and the business community in general in the sense that its administration was burdensome.Mr Accaro explained that the financing aspect of industrialisation was becoming weak as commercial banks were facing liquidity problems following the decision by the government to direct all its institutions to shift their accounts to the Bank of Tanzania.On the other hand, CTI policy and advocacy director Hussein Kamote said that Tanzania s industrialisation was on the right track but the government had to address the issue of counterfeit products which distort the market of genuine goods especially those which are produced locally. There is also a problem of smuggling into Tanzania as some defiant traders use porous borders to import and escape taxes. As a result, their items are sold cheaply and that is very dangerous for the market, said Mr Kamote.He also pointed out that Tanzania should make its policies predictable to win the confidence of investors in the industrialization process.However, economist Kahyoza was of the view that the government should not completely pullout of the industrialisation investment and leave everything to the private sector which he described as weak.According to him, the manufacturing sector for example had a stronger contribution to the economy during the early years after independence than of late despite liberalisation of the economy.He went further saying some of the privatised industries collapsed as a result of the weak private sector. It s true that there are many challenges like taxation facing the private sector but the government should not leave industrialisation to the business community alone as it s also weak, he said. Way forwardMr Accaro proposed the industrialisation to prioritise agro-processing which will produce products needed in the local market and that of the East African Community.He also said that the government is supposed to establish as many industrial parks as possible in the country to promote investment in industrialisation all over the country.He also suggested Tanzania to create a special industrialisation committee to be formed by members from both the private and public sectors and operate under the President in efforts to shorten time for starting a factory or industrialisation-related business.Mr Kahyoza stressed the need for industries which are integrated with people and create infrastructure which also link the two.According to him, the education system should also be restructured in a manner that will support skills for industrialisation.Mr Kamote stressed the trust between the private and public sectors as an important tool towards industrialisation.
