Bonang Matheba is getting a reality TV show, with filming apparently having started already. Bonang, who has shaken off rumours about her reality show before because of her busy schedule, was reportedly not paid enough money to finally allow South Africans into her very private life &#8211; but not any more. TimesLive is reporting that cameras have already started following her around, further saying fans will get so much more than what we see on social media. Her boyfriend, AKA, will also feature in the show. This year promises to be great for Queen B. She announced last year that her book would be available nationwide in April this year, news that gave her fans something to look forward to. Without giving away more details about the book, fans are already saying Matheba will be talking about her drama with DJ Zinhle, Pearl Thusi and past relationship with DJ Euphonik. She probably won&#8217;t dish out dirt on him, as he has also said he has plenty of dirt on her. We look forward to the book and the show.
