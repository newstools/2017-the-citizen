Actor and presenter Pearl Thusi has come to clear her name against allegations that she was also one of the celebrities who were part of the &#8220;ANC war room&#8221;. In an interview on Wednesday, the Quantico actor said she knew nothing about the war room, and as a result, could not comment further. &#8220;Why do you want to tell me about a knife that somebody is trying to stick in my back that I don&#8217;t even know about, and I&#8217;m not bleeding. I don&#8217;t know about anything that you&#8217;re saying, that you&#8217;re about to say, I really don&#8217;t. I just heard &#8216;saga and wall, and name&#8217;, and I don&#8217;t want to know the rest because of how you also led up to the question. I know nothing about that,&#8221; she told TimesLive. Sihle Bolani, the woman behind the alleged ANC war room , who is suing the ANC for R4 million for public relations work performed for the local government elections last year, implicated Thusi, who she has accused of participating in 12 episodes of a campaign called Right to Vote with Pearl Thusi. However, in the interview, Pearl seemed as if she did not even know what &#8220;ANC war room&#8221; was.
