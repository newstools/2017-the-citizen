Agri SA came out with guns blazing on Friday, saying Thursday s late night Cabinet reshuffle indicated disregard to the economy, ignorance with respect to investor confidence and carelessness about the future actions of rating agencies . A statement from the country s agricultural industry association added that South Africa s political leadership blatantly bedevils the economy . Agri SA s president, Johannes M ller, said President Jacob Zuma s cabinet reshuffle was not only about individuals, but more about the underlying message being conveyed especially in relation to the economy . We perceive this step by Mr Zuma as one of disregard to the economy, ignorance with respect to investor confidence and carelessness about the future actions of rating agencies, he said. Pointing to recent declines in foreign direct investment (FDI) M ller said: Clearly foreigners are not prepared to accept local policies just willy-nilly. He said FDI into South Africa had decreased by almost 70 percent in 2015 from the previous year. It thus made little, if any, sense for President Zuma having ordered minister Gordhan to cancel meetings with investors in London and New York and to return home. What message does this convey about the level of trust to be placed in our current senior country representatives and even, as was announced last night, their successors. M ller warned that a rethink of policy formulation and political conduct was necessary to avoid South Africa becoming a failed state .
