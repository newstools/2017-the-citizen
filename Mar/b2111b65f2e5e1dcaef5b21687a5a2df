Taking to Instagram, he wrote: &#8220;People were created to be loved. Things were created to be used. The reason why the world is in chaos is because things are being loved and people are being used.&#8221; On Twitter, he said: &#8220;A dog comes hungry in your yard, feed it but the minute it shines it goes back to the master, that&#8217;s how ungrateful bastards behave.&#8221; Some of his followers supported him, encouraging him to continue doing the &#8220;good&#8221; work that he has been doing for those in need.
