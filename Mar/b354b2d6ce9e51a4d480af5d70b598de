Amid frenzied speculation and alarm that President Jacob Zuma has not only axed Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas but also another 13 unlucky ministers and deputies, the rand has gone into the kind of sudden drop last seen when Zuma unexpectedly axed the former finance minister, Nhlanhla Nene. It has now been confirmed that Gordhan has been removed, with Malusi Gigaba replacing him. Neil Sinclair tweeted a graph of the damage so far. The rand had actually been doing well prior to this week, heading back to as high as R11 to the dollar. But Zuma obviously had other ideas.

One user wondered if the party was merely oblivious to its own role in this or whether they might actually be boasting. .@MYANC retweeting: &quot;Rand in freefall&quot; pic.twitter.com/i5HZzUlHNA &mdash; Doron Isaacs (@doronisaacs) March 30, 2017 Here are some of the other responses: @doronisaacs @pierredevos @MYANC This is just too much pic.twitter.com/Kd2f4Lt8zt &mdash; Zuma must GO (@MOSTHEBE) March 30, 2017 @doronisaacs @pierredevos @MYANC There&#39;s a good chance they&#39;re reading the graph upside down. &mdash; Alex Tarr (@alexthetarr) March 30, 2017 @doronisaacs @pierredevos @MYANC They have no shame to even tweet abt this &mdash; Buki B (@bukiswa) March 30, 2017
