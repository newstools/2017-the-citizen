After losing out on song of the year at the Metro FM Awards last month, Dr Malinga has taken a decision to award it to himself. The musician was nominated in the category for his hit song Akulaleli, along with Wololo, Mthande, Ndud&#8217;, Amazulu, Umsindo, Ska Bhora Moreki, Lion of Judah and Imali, but Nasty C&#8217;s Hell Naw took the award. Dr Malinga says Hell Naw did not deserve the award and suspects, along with many other people, that Mabala Noise boss Reggie Nkabinde may have bought airtime for people to vote for his artists. Some things about the awards did not make sense, he says. The Akulaleki hit maker told Daily Sun that he was the most booked artist who has used his God-given talent to sustain himself and his family. Instead of going on a holiday, Dr Malinga has chosen to reward himself with a Lingas Entertainment song of the year award that he bought himself and would put up for display.

Sources reportedly told that publication that she sobbed uncontrollably when the winner was announced. Durban ICC staff apparently had to calm down her and her dancers. The Wololo hit maker was nominated in four categories at the Metro FM Awards: Song of the Year, Best Female Album, Best Dance Album and Best New Artist, but lost out on all of them.
