Social grant increase On the other side of Soweto in Orlando East, sisters Nellie Ngobese (87) and Agnes Ncongwane (86) are not concerned about on-going Sassa contract negotiations and look forward to social grant increases. As of April 1, the old age grant will increase by R90 to R1 600 for pensioners over the age of 60 and R1 620 for those over 75; the child support grant will increase by R20 to R380; the disability and care dependency grant will increase by R90 to R1 600 and the foster care grant will increase by R30 to R920. . Even with these increases, we don t believe that this grant money is helping us as it s too little. If you look at the prices of food, they keep rising, says Ngobese. Ncongwane agrees with Ngobese, saying that their payouts are reduced by unauthorised deductions, estimated to be R200 in some cases. Human rights organisation The Black Sash has documented many complaints of unauthorised deductions from Sassa beneficiaries accounts for loan repayments, airtime, water and even electricity allegedly sold by other Net1 subsidiaries using the confidential information given to CPS. . For now, Ncongwane says the most vulnerable citizens are forgotten. We are constantly put on the side. As old people, we are the ones who worked for the country s democracy. I don t see a change at all in this country, it s getting worse even in a democracy. Brought to you by Moneyweb
