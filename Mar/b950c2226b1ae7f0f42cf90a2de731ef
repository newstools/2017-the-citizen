Musician Penny Penny has bought himself a new car, and everyone is talking about it. Penny Penny went to a garage and picked his car but was not impressed with its colour, so he asked for it to be pimped up. The car is now silver, with a touch of &#8216;goldie&#8217; on the front, and we must say, it is beautiful! For those who do not understand where the word &#8216;goldie&#8217; comes from, Penny Penny refuses to be labelled as black, as he says he&#8217;s a gold bone. Music producer Sipho Ngwenya met Papa Penny on Thursday and took a video of the car. Watch the video below: The real thing!!!
