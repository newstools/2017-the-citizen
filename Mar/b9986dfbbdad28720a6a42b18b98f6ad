Sanchez, 28, was reported to have stormed off the training pitch last week before becoming involved in an angry confrontation with his team-mates. He started Saturday&#8217;s 3-1 Premier League defeat at Liverpool on the bench and made a goal for Danny Welbeck after Wenger brought him on at half-time. The Chile forward was present for training at Arsenal&#8217;s London Colney base ahead of Tuesday&#8217;s Champions League last 16 second leg against Bayern Munich and shook hands with Wenger before the session. Sanchez has been linked with a move away from Arsenal at the end of the season, with Juventus and Paris Saint-Germain among the clubs reported to be monitoring the situation. Arsenal slipped out of the Champions League places following the weekend loss at Liverpool and must overturn a 5-1 deficit against Bayern to remain alive in this season&#8217;s competition. Wenger, whose own contract expires at the end of the season, was due to address the media later on Monday. Sanchez, a July 2014 signing from Barcelona, is Arsenal&#8217;s top scorer this season with 20 goals in all competitions and is seen as their most important player along with German playmaker Mesut Ozil. But as Arsenal&#8217;s form has dipped, his on-pitch displays of frustration have become increasingly noticeable. Wenger conceded that his decision not to start with Sanchez at Anfield had backfired, but said he had &#8220;no special regrets&#8221; about the call. Former Arsenal striker Ian Wright said he would be looking to leave the club if he was in Sanchez&#8217;s position. &#8220;If I can&#8217;t get in Arsenal&#8217;s team when they&#8217;re coming to places like Anfield when you need to win to try and stay in the top four and there&#8217;s unrest around him anyway, why do I want to stay?&#8221; Wright said on BT Sport. &#8220;We&#8217;re not actually challenging for anything. We got hammered out of the Champions League. &#8220;He is a sought-after player and if I&#8217;m sitting in the dressing room like Alexis Sanchez today, his agent his probably making phone calls now!&#8221;
