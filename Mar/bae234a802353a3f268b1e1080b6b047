Kempton Park model agency boss Dawie De Villiers told the Johannesburg High Court on Wednesday that he had run out of funds and needed time to raise money for the private compilation of a pre-sentencing document. The founder of Modelling South Africa (PTY) was found guilty of rape, sexual assault, sexual grooming, fraud, exposure of pornography to children and access to child pornography last month. State prosecuter Arveena Persad told Judge Carla Van Veenendal she believed De Villiers was employing delaying tactics as he had been given the opportunity to make use of legal aid when his counsel withdrew from the case. My advice would be for De Villiers to approach legal aid and his bail be extended to Tuesday. Advocate Annade Theart, acting for De Villiers, told the court that he would be unrepresented on Tuesday. Standing in the dock, De Villiers told Judge Van Veenendal that he only notified his lawyer he did not have funds this morning and that he was self-employed. I am self-employed, and with all the impact of the media and everything else that has been happening, that has affected my income, he said. Earlier, Theart told the court they were instructed to withdraw as funds were not paid for the continuation of the trial. De Villiers said he required a further three months to raise the funds for the pre-sentencing procedures. Persad said de Villiers s request was unreasonable, as he was found guilty of raping a minor. She said the defence notified her a week ago that there were no funds and that they were withdrawing from the case. Judge Van Veenendal told De Villiers that she understood that his finances were dire but that did not mean he could manipulate court processes. Think about having the sentencing report being drafted by the state and I d advise you to approach legal aid directly, she said. The case was postponed to March 14.
