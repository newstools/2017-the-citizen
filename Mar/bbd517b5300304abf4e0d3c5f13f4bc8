Malawian rapper Gemini Major has parted ways with Cassper Nyovest&#8217;s record label, Family Tree. In a statement, the rapper said it had been a &#8220;great journey&#8221; with &#8220;special memories&#8221; made and was thankful for the opportunity to have worked with the Mama I Made It hitmaker. &#8220;Now it&#8217;s time to focus on other things and grow as an artist and brand,&#8221; reads the statement. The Ragga Ragga rapper is leaving Family Tree to start Rudebouy Major, his own record label in partnership with Fresh 2 Def, owned by Da L.E.S. &#8220;The future is full of possibilities, and I charge ahead with so much optimism and positive vibes. It&#8217;s a matter of time before Rudebouy Major becomes a force to be reckoned with in the local music space. Watch out for us and all the new artists and collaborations we will unleash in the not so distant future,&#8221; he said.
