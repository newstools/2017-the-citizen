A 61-year-old lawyer charged with stealing at least R4 million from clients has pleaded guilty to all 33 charges of fraud and money laundering against him, in the Kimberley Magistrate s Court, Northern Cape police said on Wednesday. Sentencing proceedings against Henry Coetzee would get underway next month. Coetzee was practising in Kimberly between March 2001 and November 2010 when he embezzled almost R4 million from various victims whom he represented on their property purchases, civil matters and road accident fund claims. He was served with court summons and first appeared on 18 November 2016, said spokesman Captain Philani Nkwalase. His guilty plea shortens the court process as he doesn t have to stand trial but will await sentencing. The State said Coetzee carried out the fraudulent acts while practising in Kimberly. He later relocated to Port Elizabeth in the Eastern Cape. African News Agency (ANA) For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
