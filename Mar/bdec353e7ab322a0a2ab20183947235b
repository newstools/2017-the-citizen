Leader of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) Julius Malema has come out to lambaste the Black First Land First (BLF) on Sunday. This after the BLF started a Twitter hashtag, #EFFSoldOut, in which it insinuated the EFF sold out when they voted for the &#8220;pro-white and racist&#8221; DA during the 2016 local government elections. This controversial move by the EFF saw the DA take over Johannesburg, Tshwane and Nelson Mandela Bay metros. The BLF also said &#8220;it was also in London that the EFF for the first time criticised the president of Zimbabwe, [Robert Mugabe], and denounced the land revolution&#8221;, adding the &#8220;EFF has also denounced radical land reform as well as Mugabe, who is the only person who has been able to return land to blacks&#8221;. The BLF has always been of the view that the EFF changed its &#8220;revolutionary&#8221; ways after their 2015 visit to London, where they had a meeting with Lord Robin Renwick. The EFF leader responded by calling BLF a &#8220;curry-first&#8221; movement, implying the BLF is funded by the controversial Gupta family to delegitimise the EFF. Deputy president of the EFF Floyd Shivambu said: &#8220;I think this is the ingredient that makes staff riders that that fell off the mighty EFF to tweet #EFFSoldOut. We will never sell out.&#8221; I think this is the ingredient that makes staff riders that that fell off the mighty EFF to tweet #EFFSoldOut.

Moonsamy further labelled Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba s controversial comments against foreign nationals deliberate crucifixion of what the unification of African people is all about . How do you engage the entire mass base and convince them convince them that this is our decision let s own it? What has it yielded? In Tshwane right now there s crisis. In Johannesburg there s crisis. What has voting with the DA yielded for the black people of Tshwane or Johannesburg? I just want someone to give me a simple answer. There s chaos. The mayor of Johannesburg says that people are criminals. [He] refers to immigrants which, in the main, we know that they come from the continent, as criminals. And this is it s a dire attack it s a deliberate crucifixion of what the unification of African people is all about, said Moonsamy.
