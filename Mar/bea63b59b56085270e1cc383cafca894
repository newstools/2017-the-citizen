The &#8216;kiss cam&#8217; has now landed in Mzansi, and its first instalment is nothing short of amazing. It was during the Kaizer Chiefs and Baroka FC game at Peter Mokaba Stadium when the &#8216;kiss cam&#8217; went to the audience just to try and spice things up during the break on Saturday. Couples responded positively, giving their partners a smooch, much to the commentators&#8217; amusement. However, the camera got to one shy couple who thought they would get away without kissing. The couple, ZCC members, gave in and the man took off his cap before giving his lady a cute kiss. Watch the video below: Also read: WATCH: When a public marriage proposal goes wrong
