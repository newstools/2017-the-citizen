OK Mzansi reports that Babes was seen sobbing uncontrollably at the lavish award ceremony which took place about two weeks ago. She is apparently not taking all this well and is heavily disappointed she can&#8217;t seem to catch a break and win major awards. Her popular song, Wololo lost out to Van Damme at the SABC song of the year late last year. Everybody could campaign and I still said at the launch that these are the rules and they can t be changed at the end of the game, said SABC spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago. The voting was audited by an external company and we were informed of the winners on the day, except for the Song of the Year category, which saw votes close on the night of the awards. Twitter also noticed that Babes went home empty handed. #ThingsTrevorShouldHaveDone bought Kwesta, Dr Malinga, King Monada and Babes Wodumo METRO FM awards &mdash; Ke Mosotho (@marty_R200) February 28, 2017 With or without the METRO AWARDS, i&#39;m still your fan@ Babes Wodumo &mdash; Winile (@mkhulisewinnie) March 1, 2017 @BABESWODUMO deserves a televised apology from The President then 15 Metro Awards! &mdash; #ISLOLO (@RomzDeluxeDj) February 28, 2017 These Metro fm awards were truly corrupted I see by that @BABESWODUMO and @KwestaDaKAR didn&#39;t win! &mdash; Sphelele Mkhwanazi (@sphelele_pegza) February 26, 2017
