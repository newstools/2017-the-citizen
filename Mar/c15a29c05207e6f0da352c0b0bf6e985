Go Life International announced on Tuesday that it had agreed a strategic partnership with Elysium Healthcare that would enable the two companies to reach an estimated 2.5 billion people across 25 countries. Go Life, an integrated life sciences group with a range of patented technologies, products, ingredients and proprietary formulas in the nutraceuticals and cosmeceuticals markets, said the agreement meant it would add generic and pharmaceutical medicine to its range and expand its market potential to an additional 13 African countries, as well as India. The company, which is listed in Mauritius and on the AltX of the JSE, said the deal meant it was able to offer extensive medical services and equipment. Elysium Healthcare offers a wide range of services and products, from healthcare equipment and drug distribution and supply to healthcare marketing management, healthcare facility management and pharmaceutical development. A statement from Go Life added that the deal gave it access to extensive production and manufacturing capability, as well as a well-established e-commerce platform. It also meant Go Life would get assistance with regulatory approval, distribution and marketing from an experienced and established partner. In return, Go Life would become the exclusive nutraceutical partner and provider to the Mauritian-registered Elysium Healthcare, thereby expanding the range of medicines it offered. Go Life added that it would help Elysium Healthcare to enter 11 African countries, including South Africa, Angola, Mozambique, Tanzania and Zambia, and would assist with marketing and distribution in these countries. Also, the company said, it had committed to research and develop new nutraceutical products for Elysium Healthcare, as well as provide the company with assistance and support in development and operations of retirement, frail-care and Alzheimer centres.
