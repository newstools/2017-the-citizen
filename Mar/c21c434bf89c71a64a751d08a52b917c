Reality TV star Dineo Ranaka has shared that she had to wrap her head with a towel to hide her weave so she could take a picture with legendary musician Hugh Masekela. &#8220;It&#8217;s a true story ladies &#8211; Bra Hugh (I prefer to call him Ntate Hugh but he insists on Bra Hugh) will not be photographed with any artificial or straightened hair!! Lol,&#8221; she said. While most are offended by Masekela&#8217;s preference, Ranaka said she could not let it kill her joy, adding she refused to let her ego rob her of a moment to smile and laugh with this &#8220;lovely&#8221; man. &#8220;Respecting each other&#8217;s differences and being open to meet one another half way makes life, and it&#8217;s precious moments all the more pleasurable.&#8221; Also read: &#8216;Hobo ke mmao&#8217; &#8211; Florence Masebe slams natural hair hater The legendary musician has never made his dislike for weaves a secret, and it is a well-known fact that he refuses to take pictures with women who wear weaves except for Kuli Roberts.
