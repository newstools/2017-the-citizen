Bafana Bafana face Guinea-Bissau Saturday afternoon and Angola on Tuesday in friendlies that, in all fairness, look a little lightweight in comparison to the off-the-field issues facing the South African Football Association. Safa keep delaying the announcement of a new head coach and stand accused of further administrative incompetence in relation to midfielder Kamohelo Mokotjo. Safa apparently called up the player without being aware that he had renounced his South African citizenship, prompting a mad scramble to have him repatriated before Saturday s game. On top of this, there is the possibility that Bafana could be forced to replay November s 2018 World Cup qualifier against Senegal, which they won 2-1, with Ghanaian referee Joseph Lamptey already banned for life for unlawfully influencing the result of that match in Polokwane. Safa have not been implicated in any match-fixing here, but it is still a serious headache the association could do without. The reason for these friendlies against two former Portuguese colonies has been touted as preparation for home and away 2018 World Cup qualifiers against another former Portuguese colony, Cape Verde, in August and September. After them, a new head coach is expected to take over. The question is, will he have one or four points to play with on the road to Russia?
