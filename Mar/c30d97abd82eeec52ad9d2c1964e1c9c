In a dispatch that seemed to have come from another universe altogether, we received the news this week that Ferrari and Hublot have joined forces to design a super special edition watch. What better way for an ageing Italian marque to celebrate its 70th birthday than with an outrageously luxurious item, a limited edition for 70 of your biggest fans. That s right folks, the Hublot Techframe Ferrari 70 Years, will be available in three versions King Gold, PEEK Carbon and Titanium with just 70 limited editions of each. The watchmaker and the carmaker have said the Ferrari-designed Hublot watch was conceived with the same approach used for designing a car at the Ferrari Design Centre integrating Hublot s watchmaking expertise. The Ferrari design approach was described as using the same creative processes as that used to develop a new sports car with the starting point, the Hublot movement, being described as the engine around which a high performance chassis is designed. The Techframe Ferrari 70 years Tourbillon Chronograph opens a new chapter in the partnership that unites Hublot and Ferrari, we are told. Designed by Ferrari, crafted by Hublot, worn by as I said, it s happening in another universe.
