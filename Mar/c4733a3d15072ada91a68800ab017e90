South Sudan has given a number of foreign oil companies until the end of April to fully implement oil exploration contracts awarded by Juba or leave the country. South Sudan s Petroleum Minister, Ezekiel Lol Gatkuoth, said that if the oil companies failed to implement their oil surveys and engage with the government by April s end then they should leave the oil sector and their contracts would be terminated. The Sudan Tribune reported this week that the companies include Total and Tullow who were awarded two blocks, Block B1 and Block B2. You cannot hold my block for 30 years and think that I will be celebrating and dancing with you. This is my resource and it is my country and it is my oil. You must do it my way and if you don t do it my way, get out, Gatkuoth told reporters. The reasons behind the minister s harsh remarks remain unclear, but Total started oil exploration in Sudan in the 1970s, before South Sudan became independent. Following the outbreak of war in 1983 in Jonglei state, the company ceased oil activities before returning to the state in 2005 following the Sudanese Comprehensive Peace Agreement that guaranteed self-determination for South Sudan in 2011. Following South Sudan ceding from Sudan in 2011, it got the lion s share of the oil. However, its ability to profit from this natural resource was crippled by the only export route for the crude being through Sudanese territory, giving Khartoum political leverage over its former enemy. Levels of oil production had peaked at 350,000 bpd in the past but plummeted following a dispute with Sudan over fees for pumping South Sudan s crude through Sudan s export pipeline, ultimately culminating in a complete halt in production in 2012. Since 2013, civil war has wracked the world s newest country with hundreds of thousands killed and displaced and the country s economy decimated by the instability and a fall in crude oil prices.
