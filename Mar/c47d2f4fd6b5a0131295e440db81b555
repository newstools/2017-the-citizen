Win or lose against New Zealand in the deciding one-day international in Auckland Saturday morning, the Proteas have shown they have put an ordinary first part of 2016, and even more disappointing 2015, behind them, and they are well on their way to consistently competing against the world s best. The five-match series against the Black Caps is squared at 2-2 entering Saturday s encounter. After missing out a triangular series involving hosts the West Indies and Australia in June last year, the Proteas have really stepped up a gear, winning 12 one-day internationals, including two series whitewashes, in a row before their streak was broken on this tour. After losing the fourth match of the series in Hamilton this week they dropped to number two in the world rankings, but that won t worry Russell Domingo s men. With only three months to go until the Champions Trophy in England, they look a settled and happy squad. Yes, they have had to rely heavily on skipper AB de Villiers throughout the series. Yes, there are still positions up for grabs as not all of the combinations are clicking. But what s good news is there are positive signs that this team has found their rhythm. Saturday s must-win game will go a long way in showing if the Proteas can step up another gear. For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
