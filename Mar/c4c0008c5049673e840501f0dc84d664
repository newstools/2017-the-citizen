Presenter Sizwe Dhlomo should arrange a meeting with EFF leader Julius Malema and take lessons on how to successfully negotiate a deal. Former Reserve Bank governor Tito Mboweni on Wednesday saw Cassper Nyovest&#8217;s cover for his new single, Tito Mboweni, set to be released on Friday, and saw an opportunity to cash in. Knowing what a great negotiator Malema is, he asked him to handle the deal for him, and the results show that Juju is still the best in the game. &#8220;Juju, homeboy, can you negotiate with Cassper for royalties before Friday? Sizwe Dhlomo has successfully failed man. Eish,&#8221; he jokingly said. Those who don&#39;t know, this is the reason for negotiations! Juju, hurry up before Friday. Urgent! pic.twitter.com/TysirACBIO &mdash; Tito Mboweni (@tito_mboweni) March 8, 2017 Juju took on the task and negotiated for his former governor. Now Mboweni has again shared with his followers that the deal went through and he said that Cassper had contacted him. &#8220;Juju has fulfilled the task. @CassperNyovest has made contact with me. Khotso! Pula! Nala! Let the Youth dance and rejoice! Yours is the time!&#8221; Cassper also shared with fans that he spoke to the former governor and he gave him the go-ahead.
