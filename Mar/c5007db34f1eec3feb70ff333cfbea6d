At the Joe Mafela memorial that took place on Thursday, former Generations actress Palesa Mocuminyane approached Zola to get his comments on the passing of the TV veteran. Zola refused, and Palesa apparently took to Twitter to voice her outrage. Though the tweets have since been deleted, screengrabs were taken of all the drama. &nbsp; Actress Rami Chuene was one celebrity who took Palesa on, telling her to apologise to Zola. Palesa? Really? You had to go there? I&#39;m praying to God you&#39;re hacked or drunk! This is unacceptable, unprofessional, un-everything! Tjo! https://t.co/PNjYkG5Iel &mdash; Rami Chuene 1st Lady (@ramichuene) March 23, 2017 He obviously declined to be interviewed but does that mean u have to attack him like this? U called him irrelevant! U imply he&#39;s starving?!? https://t.co/7vP1C9eX9e &mdash; Rami Chuene 1st Lady (@ramichuene) March 23, 2017 Instead, Palesa issued a statement that she had not tweeted but her PR company. Her PR manager apologised for tweeting about Zola and said she was now out of a job. as her PR manager controlling the tweets, id like to appologise for my unprofessionalism and tweeting without her approval @PalesaMoc &mdash; Palesa Mocuminyane (@PMocuminyane) March 23, 2017 Twitter was having none of it though. #Palesa whose speaking here #PR person or Bahumi&#39;s Mom? pic.twitter.com/poLqVLw2WB &mdash; SabeloMngoma (@SebzND) March 24, 2017 Someone regulate Palesa! Zola is a national treasure! &mdash; FILMART (@ThatXhosaChick) March 24, 2017 Me on the left and my PR person on the right. As you can see, I&#39;m wearing flats and she&#39;s wearing heels.

Boiler plate and all. &mdash; Wendy Tlou (@mswendyt) March 24, 2017 People must stop fabricating accounts/tweets all in the name of throwing shade. It doesn&#39;t make you look any wiser. #Palesa #Zola &mdash; Neo Ruby Gana (@rubygana) March 24, 2017 The way Black twitter went in on Palesa over her Zola comment gave me hope that one day they might just get the land back. pic.twitter.com/dsxzDArs7L &mdash; #MaDaCiti (@TimaSipoko) March 24, 2017 ALSO READ: Pastor Mboro says he wouldn&#8217;t have charged a cent for Mafela memorial For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
