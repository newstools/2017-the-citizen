DJs Black Coffee, Fresh and Euphonik attended P Diddy&#8217;s house party and made sure to let Mzansi in on it. The DJs partied and did what they do best playing music to a dancing crowd. &#8220;Shout out to my brother Black Coffee for bringing the vibrations to another level,&#8221; said P Diddy after the party. &#8220;If you&#8217;re African please go to bed today comprehending that @RealBlackCoffee hasn&#8217;t only opened the door for us. He kicked it wide open,&#8221; said DJ Euphonik. Coffee has been trending since a video of him and P Diddy hugging it out was shared on social media. Check out some of the videos and pictures shared of the three partying hard: The way we just partied HARD @diddy house pic.twitter.com/qP2xUXNsfq &mdash; Euphonik (@euphonik) March 26, 2017 Taking over the streets of Miami. #MiamiMusicWeek #EuphonikInThehouse @signaramadftl pic.twitter.com/Sqip5OGpsx &mdash; Euphonik (@euphonik) March 24, 2017 Black Coffee x pic.twitter.com/quieHaXXMz &mdash; Thabo Makgobi (@Thabo_Makgobi) March 26, 2017 #MOER #TheCultOfCoffee pic.twitter.com/lD4La4rYQ0 &mdash; DJ Fresh (Big Dawg) (@DJFreshSA) March 25, 2017 Housepartynyana!
