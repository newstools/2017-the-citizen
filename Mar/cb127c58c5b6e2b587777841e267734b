Most South African sport fans enjoy it when young stars emerge quickly at the top level and rugby has a rich tradition of doing that. This past weekend&#8217;s action saw that being continued as two 19-year-olds feature in our team of the week. 15 &#8211; Dyllin Leyds (Stormers) He&#8217;s already known as one of South African rugby&#8217;s hardest working wings. Given the opportunity to have extra space at fullback against the Sunwolves, he soared. 14 &#8211; Madosh Tambwe (Lions) The teenager built on a promising start from last week&#8217;s debut against the Reds. And this time he actually scored tries too! 13 &#8211; Francois Venter (Cheetahs) It&#8217;s astonishing to think this stalwart only played his first competitive of 2017 at the weekend. He broke tackles at will as he looked for space, scored a try and defended well. There was certainly no signs of rustiness. 12 &#8211; Andre Esterhuizen (Sharks) He&#8217;s not the most flashy player and he definitely doesn&#8217;t play in the flashiest backline. But the big midfielder does his job superbly. 11- Raymond Rhule (Cheetahs) The winger is playing brilliant, consistent rugby. Surely he&#8217;s knocking on the Springbok door. 10 &#8211; Curwin Bosch (Sharks) Need one say more on this freakishly talented 19-year-old? 9 &#8211; Cobus Reinach (Sharks) This man is an absolute terrier but he doesn&#8217;t solely rely on his determination. Reinach is skillful and his tactical kicking has improved tremendously. South African rugby will miss him when he departs for England. 8 &#8211; Warren Whiteley (Lions) The Lions skipper is doing little to suggest that he&#8217;s not the first-choice No 8 for the Boks against France. 7 &#8211; Ruan Ackermann (Lions) There&#8217;s still some rough edges but that&#8217;s to be expected from a 21-year-old. His ball-carrying is sound and his defence is improving. 6 &#8211; Jaco Kriel (Lions) No flanker in South Africa comes close to matching him when he&#8217;s in such a rampant mood as against the Kings. It was his game-breaking skill that helped his side get the bonus point. 5 &#8211; Franco Mostert (Lions) Wholehearted performance from a wholehearted player. 4 &#8211; Ruan Botha (Sharks) He&#8217;s rapidly becoming one of the forwards of the tournament to date. Botha is the quintessential modern lock &#8211; a line-out organiser and a bully in the collisions. 3 &#8211; Coenie Oosthuizen (Sharks) He was like an extra flanker in Bloemfontein and his scrumming is strong. It&#8217;s good to see him slowly reaching some of his potential. 2 &#8211; Malcolm Marx (Lions) We all know this hulk of a hooker will always be a strong ball-carrier but the improvement of his primary skills is what&#8217;s really impressive. 1 &#8211; Thomas du Toit (Sharks) He only played 19 minutes but his work-rate was enough to make him stand out above the rest, especially on defence.
