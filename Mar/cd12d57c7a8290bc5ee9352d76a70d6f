Two people were injured but rescued from a car which plunged into a water canal in Airport Road in Bloemfontein on Friday evening, Free State paramedics said. ER24 paramedics arrived at the scene where police had found the car submerged by water, ER24 spokeswoman Annine Dormehl said. It was believed that the car skidded on the wet road and plunged into a water canal next to the new Bram Fischer Hospital in Bloemfontein just after 6pm. A construction crane had to be used to lift the car out of the water and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was performed on a 22-year-old man. ER24 transported the man to Mediclinic Bloemfontein. He was unresponsive at first and was stabilised before he was transported to hospital. One other person was transported to a nearby hospital by other emergency services on the scene, Dormehl said.
