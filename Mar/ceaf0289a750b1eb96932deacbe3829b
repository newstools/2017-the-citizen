The Proteas return to South Africa on Thursday evening following their successful tour of New Zealand. It caps off a superb summer season of cricket for the national side, who won four Test series and three One-day series during that period. But, as ever, there&#8217;ll always be interesting themes that pop up &#8211; no matter what results are achieved. Also read: Proteas ratings: Bavuma dishes up but Cook spoils the broth Russell Domingo, the Proteas coach, discussed several of them. The doubts over Domingo&#8217;s tenure &#8211; his contract expires in August &#8211; remains I haven&#8217;t reapplied for my job yet. In fact, I don&#8217;t even know what the process is. At the moment, I&#8217;m going fishing for a couple of weeks so that&#8217;s the last thing on my mind. It&#8217;s out of my control, what happens will happen. I don&#8217;t know (yet if I&#8217;ll apply again), I suppose everyone wants to coach the national side. It&#8217;s where you want to coach. I&#8217;ve loved my four years but if they&#8217;re up, so be it. I&#8217;ve had some great results and some disappointments. I&#8217;m not looking too far ahead. The Proteas are embracing transformation I sit and watch games at a place like SuperSport Park in Centurion and I realise the demographics of our support base seems so different now. It&#8217;s fantastic to see people of different races and cultures supporting us. It&#8217;s special to be a part of that. I&#8217;ve had a long chat with Temba Bavuma. His numbers might not look spectacular at this stage of his career. But he&#8217;s won us a Test in Hobart and won us the one here in Wellington. He played a massive role in winning us the Test in Perth too. Temba has delivered some unbelievable performances at crucial times. There are a few things he still needs to learn but there&#8217;s no doubt he&#8217;ll be a special player. Kagiso Rabada is already a champion. We&#8217;ve seen some amazing things from him. It&#8217;s wonderful to be a part of this new generation of players who conduct themselves so well. Faf du Plessis is rapidly becoming a Proteas legend He&#8217;s been fantastic and done a great job. He hasn&#8217;t only made an impact through his leadership but his batting too. Faf has come back really strongly after that tour tour to India in late 2015 with the bat. I&#8217;m really pleased for him. He walks the walk and demands a lot from his players. He&#8217;s willing to walk onto the field and live up to those demands. I&#8217;m very proud of him. The selectors need to take a long, hard look at some of the top-order batters, like Stephen Cook and JP Duminy There are some challenges in this regard, of that there&#8217;s no doubt. With a big Test series in England looming, we&#8217;ve got some work to do. We need to sit down with the selection panel and plan the way forward. We&#8217;ve got some quality players. It&#8217;s just about giving them some confidence and helping them play well again. They&#8217;ve all made great contributions before, it&#8217;s just to get them back in a good space.
