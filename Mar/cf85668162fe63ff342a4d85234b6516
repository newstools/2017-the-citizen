Returning to top-flight competition, Ashleigh Moolman-Pasio admitted she had been hampered by a niggle on Saturday after settling for 18th position at the Strade Bianche road race in Italy. The Cervelo-Bigla rider, who broke her hip in a crash late last season, finished one minute, 46 seconds (1:46) off the pace in the 127km one-day contest, which formed the first leg of the 2017 Women&#8217;s World Tour. Olympic bronze medallist Elisa Longo Borghini of Italy (Wiggle High5) won a hard-fought battle at the front of the peloton in 3:44:45. &#8220;My hip just locked up so the race was maybe a little too hard,&#8221; Moolman-Pasio said. &#8220;It was the first real test and this is a hard race, but I am still ahead of where anyone thought I&#8217;d be, so I am happy.&#8221; With the race also forming the fifth leg of the Men&#8217;s World Tour, South African team Dimension Data secured another top-10 finish. British rider Scott Thwaites took 10th place for the SA-registered outfit in the 175km men&#8217;s contest. He was nearly three minutes behind former world champion Michal Kwiatkowski (Team Sky) of Poland who broke clear up front to win convincingly in 4:42:42.
