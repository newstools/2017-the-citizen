In an event described as a stroke of fate in a report by the Good Things Guy, a trained emergency response specialist happened to be driving past the Fourways construction site when a worker fell six to seven metres on Friday morning. The report by the Good Things Guy said the specialist, Michael Dawes, who resides in Fourways, is a member of the Off Road Rescue Unit, which works closely with local and national Emergency Management Services. Dawes reportedly was able to assist at the accident scene until Netcare 911 paramedics arrived on the scene. The Citizen reported on Friday that Netcare 911 airlifted the critically injured patient from the scene. For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
