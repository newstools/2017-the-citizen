A grandmother, using her car, fought off an armed man who tried to hijack her in north Durban, Northglen News reports. Pretty Gwambe, who was driving to pick up her granddaughter from Crusaders Sports Club, when the incident occurred under the Duff s Road bridge at about 7.45pm on Tuesday night. The 66-year-old managed to knock the hijacker off his feet using her car as a buffer. I wasn t driving fast, I was doing about 100km/h when I saw two men on the other side of the bridge. Suddenly I saw somebody jump right in front of my car. He then began banging on my bonnet and then began grappling with my driver s door handle. He had a knife which he was brandishing. The two men, who were his accomplices, also tried to run across the road, thankfully a car coming the other way halted their progress.&#8221; READ MORE: One suspected hijacker dead after shootout I just swerved my car in the armed man s direction, and I knocked him off his feet, and heard a loud crunch. I just wanted to get away, I thought it was my tyre, and I said I m not stopping there, so I just drove off. I saw the hijacker getting up off the ground in my rearview mirror. I sped to the Rinaldo Road petrol station and pulled over because the adrenaline had worn off. I was in complete shock. The whole time the man was trying to get in I just kept thinking of picking up my granddaughter, she said. Gwambe said she wanted to warn other motorists driving in the vicinity to be on the lookout. I just want to warn people, don t stop or be fooled by these antics. I m too scared to even drive there now, I m lucky that I was able to escape, she said. &#8211; Caxton News Service For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
