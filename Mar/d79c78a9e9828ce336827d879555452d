&#8220;Today (Thursday) I was interviewed as part of a long scheduled hearing by the Swiss federal prosecutor and I answered his questions,&#8221; the former chairman of Germany&#8217;s 2006 bid committee said. &#8220;Out of respect for the very correct federal prosecutor&#8217;s office, and also at his request, I will not speak any more about this case,&#8221; added Beckenbauer. The Swiss investigation is focusing on a payment of 6.7 million euros made by the German Football Federation (DFB) to world football&#8217;s governing body FIFA in 2005. Beckenbauer, 71, who won World Cup titles for West Germany as a player and a coach, headed the 2006 bid and has admitted making mistakes, but denied any wrongdoing over the tournament.
