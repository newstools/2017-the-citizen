Refiloe &#8216;Cassper Nyovest&#8217; Phoolo has released his much-anticipated single, &#8216;Tito Mboweni&#8217;, and Twitter had mixed feelings about it. While there were those who said the song was not good, his fans commended him for giving them &#8216;good&#8217; music after a long wait. Even his rival, AKA, retweeted the song, though we&#8217;re not sure if he retweeted because he thought it was great, or just shutting down accusations that he threw shade at Cassper earlier this week. EFF leader Julius Malema, a huge fan of Cassper, had words for those who said his music was trash. &#8220;Go and hang,&#8221; said Malema. Let&#39;s go Papa, haters can go and hang @CassperNyovest @tito_mboweni #TitoMboweni pic.twitter.com/rqcwhpNWN1 &mdash; Julius Sello Malema (@Julius_S_Malema) March 10, 2017 After only 20 minutes of its release on iTunes, the single took the number one spot, dethroning his rival AKA s The World Is Yours , which has been occupying the spot for a weeks now. Before the single was released, Cassper told his fans that he was going for number one, and now he s there. He said he would get there without using publicity stunts, in a tweet that left many wondering if he was throwing shade at AKA for his breakup stunt.
