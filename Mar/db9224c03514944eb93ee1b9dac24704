Priya Khoshal, Nomasonto Mshoza Maswanganyi&#8217;s client, was left fuming after the kwaito artist failed to deliver the skin-lightening creams she had ordered from her last year. After doing research on skin-lightening products in South Africa, Khoshal said she sent Mshoza a message on Facebook and told her she was getting married in July and wanted her to help her get rid of her skin problems. Mshoza reportedly told Khoshal she could sell her skin-lightening products that would make her as beautiful for R20 000. Khoshal told The Sowetan she gave Mshoza everything in December and was told she would receive her products &#8220;in two weeks&#8221;. Three months later, and she has not received her products. The bride-to-be reportedly told the daily Mshoza was avoiding her, as she had blocked her on Facebook and WhatsApp. When she calls her, Mshoza just hangs up, she said. Mshoza has, however, called this whole thing a &#8220;misunderstanding&#8221;, saying she was also a victim of a scam. She said she was working with a woman from Swaziland to sell skin products and said the woman used her because she was famous. She told the publication she would receive money for orders but never got the products back. As a result, she has had to pay people their money back and said she would pay Khoshal her money back. Mshoza has previously revealed she takes 18 pills for her condition , though she also clarified that they were not skin-lightening pills. She said being a public figure, she felt that if people wanted to continue saying she hated being black, they could do that. Deep down, I know for a fact that it s not about that. I still don t feel like I want to explain my condition, and the sad part is that this is going to keep happening. It s a condition that I m going to have to live with for the rest of my life.&#8221; Read more: Mshoza takes 18 pills daily for her &#8216;condition&#8217; &nbsp;
