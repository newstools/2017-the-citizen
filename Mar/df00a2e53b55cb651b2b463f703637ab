There are times when the best-handicapped is not necessarily supported by the form which is the case in the Listed Ibhayi Stakes over 1400m on the turf track at Fairview on Friday. Based on merit ratings Green Lantern comes out as the best weighted runner. However, based on their last run, which was over the course and distance, the Alan Greeff-trained runner looks unlikely to get the better of Story Of My Life. The pair last met over this course and distance in a Sophomore Plate at level weights. Story Of My Life went on to win that race, beating The Merry Widow by 0.50 lengths. Green Lantern could only finish sixth, although he was just 3.60 lengths behind the winner. On this occasion Green Lantern is 2kg better off but that should not be enough to make up the deficit. The same rule applies to Cock-A-Hoop from the Justin Snaith yard. He 1kg out with Green Lantern based on merit ratings but when they met in September it was Cock-A-Hoop who came out on top by 4.25 lengths. Once again Green Lantern is 2kg better off but looks unable to turn the tables, although that last meeting was on the Polytrack. Cock-A-Hoop returned to Cape Town where he contested the Grade 2 Selangor Cup and two other handicaps against some decent opposition. He did not win a race but in the last handicap race he finished a 1.30 length third behind Rinjani after losing ground at the start over 1400m at Kenilworth. Gavin Lerena takes the ride and the three-year-old son of Western Winter looks the runner to beat, although he has been out of action for 62 days.
