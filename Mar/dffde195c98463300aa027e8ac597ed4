Transformation has been a reality for years, even for the Springbok side. And if there&#8217;s one thing national coach Allister Coetzee believes it s about quality and not quantity. The Springboks have been set a transformation targets of at least nine players of colour in the matchday squad by 2019. Four of those must be ethnic black players.

It&#8217;s about getting talented players, white and black, or should I rather say black and white, into our mix, giving them opportunity and backing them.&#8221; Despite criticism last year for not reaching his targets, Coetzee insists he has never shied away of giving players of colour opportunities, as long as it was based on merit. &#8220;I m not scared to give players opportunity. I even invited young guns to the camp but they also have their Under-20 camp. Talented players like Curwin Bosch and Embrose Papier are being looked at,&#8221; he said. Coetzee, desperate to improve on his record of four wins in 12 Test matches, recently went on a fact-finding mission to the United Kingdom as part of his more thorough planning process for this year. &#8220;The logistical planning is done, where we are flying, which airlines you flying with, where we are staying, that s done and dusted,&#8221; he said. I went on a recce tour to the UK &#8230; I spent eight days there.&#8221; The Bok mentor though doesn&#8217;t want high expectations to be limited to the national side. &#8220;It s time we win Super Rugby and it s time we win the international Under-20 title as well. &#8220;I know expectations are high and with Boks it s a massive thing. So what I ve learned is that every Test match is so vital to win, regardless who you play. This is the view and philosophy I have and it will stay like that.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
