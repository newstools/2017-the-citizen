Security has been taken to an advanced level at the public protector&#8217;s Pretoria office after two criminal complaints were made by Busisiwe Mkhwebane following the leaks of the state capture and the draft report into Apartheid-era state bailouts. The State Security Agency has been called into debug the offices as per Mkhwebane&#8217;s instructions, according to the Mail and Guardian. A sweep of Mkwhebane and deputy Kevin Malunga&#8217;s offices were debugged by SSA and consent was given by Malunga. Public protector spokesperson Oupa Segalwe told the newspaper the request was authorised by Malunga and Mkhwebane. &#8220;Feedback was received from the SSA, advising that both the public and deputy public protector&#8217;s offices have been debugged,&#8221; he said.

She felt strongly about protecting the independence of the PP&#8217;s office because it deals with sensitive information, confidential whistle-blowers that need to be assured of protection.&#8221; ALSO READ: Prasa contractor paid R80m to ANC lawyer and Zuma&#8217;s friend For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
