Sports presenter Robert Marawa and Pearl Thusi are definitely serving us relationship goals right now. Marawa celebrated his 44th birthday last week, and Pearl had nothing but sweet things to say to her man. Robert has shared a video of the surprise birthday party Pearl organised for him, and it&#8217;s all sorts of amazing. In the video, Pearl can be seen leading Robert, who was blindfolded, to a group of guests including her daughter, Thandolwethu, Zakes Bantwini and her business partner, Jennifer Bala. The party seems to have been a lot of fun, with Anele Mdoda saying she would go back for the leftovers. Robert shared a sweet message to &#8220;chief organiser of the party and of my heart&#8221; Pearl and those who were involved in the planning. Watch the sweet video below: Thanks to all the co-conspirators who kept this well-guarded secret and who attended!!! I will get u back soon!!
