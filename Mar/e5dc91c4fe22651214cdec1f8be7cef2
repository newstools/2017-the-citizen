An administration block and eight classes were burgled and then set alight at a school in Nelspruit at the weekend, but police said no arrests have yet been made. Nelspruit police on Monday urged people to come forward with information that could lead to the arrest of the thieving arsonists who set alight a high school at Madras in Marite near Hazyview. The thieves, who are now on the run, first broke into the administration block of Lamulelani High School. They then took all the tools, food as well as other valuable items before burning the whole administration block as well as eight classes, police spokesperson, Sergeant Gerald Sedibe said. Community members, who were herding cattle near the school, noticed the damages on Sunday and alerted the police. It was the second school torched in Madras this month. First to be torched was the Bakutsoe High School which was set alight on March 15, during a service delivery protest, said Sedibe. Anyone with information that could lead to the arrest of the culprits is urged to Lieutenant Colonel Dudu Shabangu at 072 937 3542 or call the Crime Stop number 08600 10111.
