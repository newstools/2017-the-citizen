Dar es Salaam. The controversial Lake Natron Soda Ash project is yet to attract a reliable investor, nearly a decade since the search started, the National Development Corporation (NDC) has confirmed.NDC corporate affairs manager Abel Ngapemba told BusinessWeek that although an environment impact assessment (IEA) had been carried out no investor had shown up.Lake Natron is located in Ngorongoro District.The lake is in the Rift Valley. It is near the famous active volcanic mountain of Oldonyo Lengai.The lake has a huge reserve of soda ash arising from deposition of volcanic materials for millions of years, according geologists. The project awaits a prospective investor, said Mr Ngapemba.However, according to NDC s 2014 report, a preliminary feasibility study has shown that the project is profitable to both investors and the government as it can generate at least Sh240 billion annually.The report showed that after a seven-year stalemate, the proposed project was back on track with the NDC intending to get 500,000 tonnes of soda ash annually.Last year s report released by the NDC showed that the area along the lake had soda ash deposit of 4.7 trillion tonnes that can last for 540 years.According to NDC, the figure makes Tanzania the third country in the world after the US and Turkey for having large deposits of soda ash.National Environment Management Council director general Bonaventure Baya recently said that NEMC had not yet approved NDC s EIA. We are still working on it. Mr Yukundus Mhonda of the University of Dar es Salaam s Department of Aquatic Sciences said as the EIA was yet to be okayed it would be difficult to attract the investor for project which triggered protests from environmentalists.During the fourth phase government, the then Prime Minister Edward Lowassa spoke about the importance of proceeding with the project for the sake of economy, but nothing came out of it.Since 2008, the Lake Natron Consultative Group (LNCG) has been protesting against the soda ash plant in this important laser flamingo breeding site.But NDC maintained that the project would continue as it had been designed despite Tata Chemical s announcement that it would await a Ramsar Management Plan being developed for Lake Natron.Since 2008 when the Tata Chemical withdrew from the project, there has been no other prospective investor.Soda ash, chemically known as sodium carbonate, is an essential constituent in the manufacturing of all kinds of glasses, production of detergents, industrial chemicals; water treatment, paper industries, petroleum refining, textile industries, flue gas desulphurisation and mineral processing.Lake Natron is the most important breeding site for lesser llamingos in the world, according to BirdLife International.East Africa has at least 2.5 million lesser flamingos, representing three-quarters of the world s population and most of them are hatched at Lake Natron, reads part of the 2008 report of International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). It is the only significant and regular breeding site in East Africa for three quarters of lesser flamingos in the world. Lesser flamingo is classified as near-threatened by BirdLife on the IUCN Red List. It is listed on Appendix II of CITES and on Appendix II of the Convention for the Conservation of Migratory Species.The ecosystem also supports the pastoral livelihoods of the local communities and is an important habitat for other wildlife species elephant, buffalo, hyena, lion, Oryx among others, according to IUCN.
