Dar es Salaam. Analysts believe that while policy issues were at stake, the election of outspoken Chadema director of legal affairs Tundu Lissu as new president of the Tanganyika Law Society (TLS) is a protest vote against the political establishment whose relations with members of the bar association is generally seen to be heading South.They have also said that the victory of the firebrand politician marks the beginning of a fresh battle pitting the government against the TLS, which has in recent years been chastised for not doing enough to defend the rule of law in the country.While there have been mixed signals in the weeks leading to the election day on the possibility of a Lissu victory, it was the landslide on Saturday that might have been aimed at sending a strong message to the government, some observers believe.The opposition politician, a renowned lawyer, clinched the TLS presidency after garnering an overwhelming 1,411 votes, an equivalent of 84 per cent of the 1,682 ballots cast in the election held in Arusha at the weekend.His closest challenger, Ms Victoria Mandari, came in second with 176 votes. Shockingly, former TLS president Francis Stolla garnered a paltry 64 votes, while another aspirant, Mr Godwin Mwasonga bagged 24.Former Home Affairs minister Lawrence Masha withdrew his candidacy a day before the election, ostensibly to boost Mr Lissu s bid.There is a general feeling among political analysts that the government shot itself in the foot by taking its war against the lawyers to the public.President John Magufuli was the first to reveal how unhappy the government was with the direction the bar association had taken.Speaking during Law Day celebrations, he warned lawyers to avoid meddling in politics, and said he would have to think twice before appointing anyone from the 600-member TLS to a senior position within the Judiciary.The President also made a veiled reference to Mr Lissu s bid for the presidency, and expressed displeasure over information he said he had about individuals from certain political parties who were eyeing the bar association s top office.Later on, Justice and Constitutional Affairs minister Harrison Mwakyembe let the cat out of the bag when he threatened to disband the body, accusing it of meddling in politics.Prof Kitila Mkumbo, a political analyst and senior lecturer at the University of Dar es Salaam, says the minister s threat betrayed the fear in government of a vibrant TLS. In the past two years, the lawyers association had become so ineffective and toothless, he says, It had reached the extent of failing to challenge the government on democracy and good governance issues, and refrained from engaging in critical issues. He is optimistic that the recently-elected TLS leadership will usher in a new era. Strong message According to the UDSM don, the lawyers have just used the election of their presidency to send a strong message to the government that they would not tolerate being cow-towed, but believe in their ability to make independent decisions. The government has been making the mistake of attempting to interfere with the independence of various organisations. This time they hit the brick wall because TLS members are self-recognising. Dr Hamad Salim, a political analyst at the Open University of Tanzania (OUT), says it may be too early to predict the nature of the relationship between the government and bar association, going forward.But he is also of the view that the overwhelming choice of Mr Lissu to lead the lawyers body is a protest vote against the government.He notes: I am convinced that the lawyers voted under protest; a friend of mine who is a TLS member made it a point to attend this year s Annual General Meeting after absconding the previous gatherings. But Mr Bashiru Ally, a lecturer at UDSM, differs.He dismisses the notion that votes were cast in protest against the government saying TLS members are professionals who need not wait until an election to make their grievances known by the responsible authorities. Mr Lissu won the position because of his popularity, he says, adding, Conflict with the government could hardly be prevented; it will always be there regardless of how much people are hurt, but in the end they will be settled. Despite his popularity as a person, what could have possibly helped catapult Mr Lissu, who is also the Singida East Member of Parliament, are the forces that seemed to be working against his candidature at a time there is a lot of suspicion on plots by the powers that be to hijack the bar association.Just days ahead of the election, the Kisutu Resident Magistrate s Court set Mr Lissu free after the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) dropped sedition charges against him, but in a dramatic turn of events, the MP was re-arrested on fresh charges, and taken to the Central Police Station for questioning.Mr Lissu said it was a plot hatched by the government to stop him from vying for the TLS presidency, which then was week away. The government through its puppet attorneys has hatched a plan to stop me from running for the TLS presidency. They wanted to file a case to stop my candidature, but we pre-empted them, and now they have decided to use the Police Force. They are living in fear, he said in a statement circulated on social media.Mr Lissu further claimed that the plan was for police to hold him until the TLS elections were over, adding that puppet TLS members had been lined up to argue that any absent contender should be barred from the contest.Mischievous plan I want all advocates who want a new start for TLS to reject these mischievous plans. There is nowhere in TLS regulations prohibiting a candidate who is absent from the election venue from being elected. I ask you to stand firm and ensure that all those who have been nominated are included on the ballot. This should be the end of the government picking leaders for us and a fresh start for TLS that will enable it to stand for the interests of its members and Tanzanians in general, Mr Lissu said.And Mr Masha, the former Home Affairs minister, said in a post on his Facebook page: This year s election is exciting because the majority of lawyers are tired of seeing the rights of Tanzanians abused by state organs. Tanzanians want respect for the rule of law and good governance...they want a lawyers association that is free to criticise the government when they see that justice is not being done. Two days before the elections, Mr Lissu was arrested again at his Dodoma home as he was preparing to attend a case at the High Court.He was transported to Dar es Salaam where he appeared before the court last Friday, and granted bail hours before travelling to Arusha where TLS meeting had had begun.The hero s welcome he received on arrival had everything laid bare before voting started.Some analysts are of the view that the government now faces two options to go back to the drawing board and change tact in its dealing with the lawyers body, or continue gambling with its confrontational attitude. There are no signs yet that, after the vow to never accept a TLS led by a perceived politician, the government would reach out.President Magufuli himself has taken a hardline stance warning that he would not Never, over my dead body! You must observe neutrality. Once you are neutral everyone will respect you. The development of this country doesn t depend on any political party, he told legal experts in Dar es Salaam on Law Day last month.Days later, Dr Mwakyembe threatened to amend the law that established the TLS decades ago, to disband it. UDSM political science lecturer Richard Mbunda says the future of any form of a relationship between the two sides will depend on whether or not the government was eager to change.Prof Kitila Mkumbo concurs, and quickly points out that some government officials should change, and leave the TLS alone.And Dr Salim believes that TLS is in itself a powerful and influential body, hence the fears in government. He believes once the election dust settles, the two can work together.
