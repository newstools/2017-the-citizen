People who inject themselves with drugs (PWIDs) in Dar es Salaam face the risk of being infected with Tuberculosis (TB) due to low immunity and their poverty situation, experts have warned.It is estimated that 42 per cent of PWIDs in the city have low immunity due to HIV infection, the experts have further revealed in an interview with Your Health.Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH) Genexpert Focal Person, central Tuberculosis Reference Laboratory, Saidi Mfaume said that the bacteria causing TB attack patients with low immunity, such as those infected with HIV, the diabetic patients as well as injecting drug users.Kinondoni Regional Tuberculosis and Leprosy Coordinator Dr Mrisho Lupinda said that doctors at Mwananyamala Hospital are now treating about 30 addicted drug users and injectors who are currently on anti-TB drugs.Dr Lupinda says the Mwananyamala Methadone Centre is now encouraging the patients to go out to the community to talk other drug users and sensitise them to report to hospital for check-ups in case they have TB.He noted that National Tuberculosis and Leprosy Program (NPLP) estimate that 50 per cent of TB patients in Tanzania are also infected with HIV. Actually, it is estimated that 5 to 10 per cent HIV infected patients can get Tb and HIV/AIDS, he said. Active case findings for tuberculosis conducted at the Medically Assisted Treatment (MAT) recently has shown that there is a more than 20 to 37 fold risk of TB compared to non HIV infected persons.As of 2009, Tanzania ranked fifteenth among 22 countries with a high TB burden by the World Health Organisation (WHO).The epidemics of tuberculosis TB and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are intertwined with heroin addiction in the country, experts say.As of 2005, there were an estimated 200, 000 250 000 individuals using heroin in Tanzania, with approximately 40 000 injectors.Although methadone treatment is available, demand for treatment outpaces supply.Methadone treatment program for the drug users was introduced in 2011 at the MNH to address heroin addiction with the goal of reducing injection use, preventing HIV and helping those with HIV to engage them in care and treatment.This was the first public methadone clinic in sub-Saharan Africa, and all clients were heroin injectors. An early methadone patient died of TB, prompting concerns that others may have TB.A pilot study carried out recently at the methadone treatment clinic revealed that out of 150 patients surveyed, about 16 per cent had one or more TB symptoms and were referred for laboratory testing. Six new TB cases were identified in this active case finding program, with a prevalence of 4 per cent.This prevalence is 23 times that of the general population of Tanzania.The study explained that in East Africa, Tanzania has been an important stop along international drug trafficking routes for three decades. The United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime estimated that there were 1,736 000 heroin users in Africa in 2011, of whom approximately a third reside in Eastern Africa.The WHO recommends that all services dealing with drug users have should have a case-finding protocols for identifying TB patients and subjecting them to treatment.These undiagnosed cases could be lethal without early treatment, and could pose an infection risk to fellow patients and health care workers, says the WHO.In response to this, and in line with WHO recommendations for screening drug users, MAT implemented an active case-finding program among methadone clients to assess prevalence and link cases to treatment.
