Jurie Roux, chief executive of the South African Rugby Union (Saru), believes the local governing body will continue to perform poorly financially if the Springboks don&#8217;t sort out their own bad form. Some critics will say that&#8217;s merely a way of shifting the blame but there&#8217;s merit to the argument. Under Allister Coetzee, the Boks won a pitiful 4 out of 12 Tests in 2016 and have done precious little to attract new sponsorship following the withdrawal of several partners at the end of 2015. As a result, Saru reported a R23.3 million loss for the last financial year. &#8220;People accuse me of oversimplifying the debate. But if we don&#8217;t improve the product on the field and create a better experience for fans, we&#8217;ll continue to have this problem,&#8221; Roux said following the unveiling of Fly Safair as the Boks&#8217; new domestic airline carrier. &#8220;We need to play rugby that people enjoy. That&#8217;s not running rugby necessarily. It&#8217;s winning rugby. People like teams that win.&#8221; Saru controversially stated in a press release announcing the financial results that they felt the loss was actually &#8220;satisfactory&#8221;. Naturally, some observers were quick to pick up on that. Roux had an explanation for that. &#8220;It was a poor year. We have to be honest about that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We lost a major sponsor at the 11th hour at the end of 2015, along with two other smaller partners. That left us with a gap of R130 million in our budget. &#8220;A sponsorship like that takes 18 months to negotiate. To try and rescue something like that in a year is very difficult. That&#8217;s why we used the term &#8216;satisfactory&#8217;. We were on our way to losing R130 million yet limited it to R23 million. In a year where the Boks lost 70% of their matches, it&#8217;s probably a triumph of sorts.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
