The hip hop artist&#8217;s 25-year sentence handed down in 2012 was changed to an eight-year sentence for culpable homicide in 2014. He and his friend killed four schoolchildren during a drag racing accident. Since then, he has released a new rap track, &#8220;Ke Kopa Tshwarelo&#8221; (Please Forgive Me), which talks of how sorry he is, in Setswana and English.
