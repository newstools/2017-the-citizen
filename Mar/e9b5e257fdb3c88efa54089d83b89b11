Following the news that India&#8217;s Bank of Baroda, which the Gupta family uses to run its affairs in South Africa, may also be closing their accounts to stay in keeping with banking law, South Africans took to social media to air their views. Most were very dismissing of the family, though they also had their supporters. Former Gauteng premier Mbhazima Shilowa joked that Minister of Mineral Resources Mosebenzi Zwane needs to up his game when it comes to protecting the Guptas. Mosebenzi should convene the Cabinet Committee on Gupta bank closures to urgently meet with the Bank of Baroda. Family must be protected &mdash; Mbhazima Shilowa (@Enghumbhini) March 2, 2017 He also joked that ANC Youth League president Collen Maine&#8217;s mortgage might be in trouble after reports that the Guptas have sponsored his house. I am worried about what will happen to Oros s bond. This is just not onhttps://t.co/b7UBb06LGu &mdash; Mbhazima Shilowa (@Enghumbhini) March 2, 2017 Bank of Baroda that financed Oros mansion shuts Gupta accounts&#8211;&gt;Bank of Baroda SA closing Gupta accounts https://t.co/PE4wvaUcD7 (via ) &mdash; Mametja Elvis (@MametjaE) March 2, 2017 EFF deputy president Floyd Shivambu was more scathing: &#8220;Bank of China closed their accounts, and now Bank of Baroda is closing their accounts, but we have Zombies campaigning that SA government must institute a commission of inquiry against SA Banks for closing the bank accounts of these corrupt business associates of Zuma. &#8220;The Guptas are running a mafia state, a gangster state presided by their business partner and they will loot SA to nothing if we all fold our hands.&#8221; India&#39;s Bank of Baroda (Oros&#39; house financier) are closing Guptas (Zuma&#39;s business partners) bank accounts. The Mafia State has short legs. &mdash; Floyd Shivambu (@FloydShivambu) March 2, 2017 One of the Guptas&#8217; defenders theorised that the SA Reserve Bank had bullied the bank into taking action. Bank of Baroda must have been bullied by SARB where the other banks are shareholders since Richards Bay Terminal exports coal 24hrs a day &mdash; M||o (@MxolisiBob) March 2, 2017 A Twitter user expressed mock concern that Black First Land First leader Andile Mngxitama might now miss a pay cheque. Mngxitama has long been accused of being on the Guptas&#8217; payroll. @Mngxitama &#8230;I&#39;m sure uve heard that the bank of Baroda has closed Gupta account. How r u going to be paid my man? &mdash; Lumko (@mndabeni) March 2, 2017 Mngxitama had earlier accused the media of publicising &#8220;imagined&#8221; Gupta corruption but being silent on the alleged corruption of companies his enemy Johann Rupert is involved with. Very strange: People who are angry about the imagined Gupta corruption. Are silent on the real Rupert corruption. https://t.co/y03LzQoeFC &mdash; andile (@Mngxitama) March 2, 2017 Manya and others will probably blame Gordhan and Rupert for the closing of Guptas bank accounts by Bank of Baroda. pic.twitter.com/QnkZwdAyhQ &mdash; Lesia (@lesiamolibeli) March 2, 2017
