Penelope Machete has defended her &#8220;bad attitude&#8221; on Sunday night&#8217;s episode of Date My Family. Responding to Twitter users who asked her why she was rude towards Thembinkosi Sikhupela, she blamed the show and said they edited out the bits where she was nice to him. &#8220;The thing is way edited, all the nice things I said were not showed,&#8221; she said in a tweet that has since been deleted. . Penelope, Amanda and Thandi were contestants on the show, competing to win over Thembinkosi&#8217;s heart. The 29-year-old digital media coordinator and businessman had been single &#8211; probably still is, since the date didn&#8217;t work out &#8211; for 18 months. He said he was looking for a &#8220;smart&#8221; woman. However, things didn&#8217;t quite go according to plan after meeting the three women&#8217;s families who criticised him for, among other things, not having a car, his financial stability and physical appearance. After all the bad comments about him, Thembinkosi chose to go on a date with Penelope, whose comments left Twitter fuming. While Date My Family trends every Sunday night, she got her own hashtag, with people dragging her for being rude to &#8220;sweet&#8221; Thembinkosi. &#8220;I am still hurt by the way Penelope treated Thembinkosi. Very rude, negative comments about someone&#8217;s appearance, disgusting,&#8221; said one. Most said her beauty was overshadowed by her bad attitude, saying she did not deserve good things in life. There were those, however, who said Penelope just knew what she wanted in a man and was not willing to compromise. &#8220;Penelope is the one,&#8221; said one of her supporters.
