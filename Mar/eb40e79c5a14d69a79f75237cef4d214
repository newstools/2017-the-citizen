It would be accurate to say that Western Cape Premier Helen Zille and US President Donald Trump have both stepped into the ever open jaws of the trap social media offers. The initial problem for high profile users is the very accessibility and instantaneous nature of Twitter as a medium. The true down side is the fact that once a thought has been wafted into the willing ether, it remains indelibly. Trump, an inveterate user of social media he has both personal and presidential accounts has never been known for restraint in what he puts out there. His tweeted promise for the future is just one such case. Today, I was thrilled to announce a commitment of $25 BILLION &amp; 20K AMERICAN JOBS over the next 4 years. THANK YOU There is little doubt that this will come back to haunt him if that promise remains even partially unfulfilled. Zille s case is similar, yet intriguingly different. She is an astute politician, a gifted journalist in her own right and tough enough to have endured the slings and arrows her varied careers have handed her, yet willingly weighed in on the touchy subject of defending colonialism. The lesson? Engage your brain before you open your Twitter. Bizarre to burn Zille at the stake over colonialism tweet For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
