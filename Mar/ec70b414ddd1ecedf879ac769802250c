The 35-year-old striker has quickly established himself as a fans&#8217; favourite at Old Trafford, having so far scored 26 goals in 41 appearances in his debut season after joining on a free transfer from Paris Saint-Germain. Ibrahimovic has the option of another year on his contract, with United manager Jose Mourinho &#8212; under whom he played at Inter Milan &#8212; making it clear he would like him to stay with the English giants. &#8220;I&#8217;m a person when I go into something I put my head 200 percent and I do what I&#8217;m good at,&#8221; said Ibrahimovic in comments reported by the Manchester Evening News. &#8220;I go in, I go for the kill and I go out. And when I go out, there is no complaints, that&#8217;s what I do. I never leave a job unfinished. &#8220;Let&#8217;s see what happens, we are talking. I have an option for another year, I want to do great as long as I&#8217;m here, so let us see, there is a lot of time.&#8221; Meanwhile Ibrahimovic made it clear how much he was relishing his time under Mourinho at United by adding: &#8220;I&#8217;m enjoying being at a fantastic club, without doubts, one of the biggest clubs in the world with a great coach. I know him before, he&#8217;s a winner, he&#8217;s the perfect coach for this club. &#8220;Being a Manchester United player, I don&#8217;t know how many people have that possibility but I am a Man United player, people wanted me here. I chose the best English club.&#8221;
