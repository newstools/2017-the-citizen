The world&#8217;s top soccer players are known for endorsing well-known products. Think of Lionel Messi and the Spanish painter that steal his Lay&#8217;s potato chips or Real Madrid&#8217;s stars using Nivea products. Even Bafana Bafana skipper Itumeleng Khune made headlines with his unauthorised endorsement deal with Danone. But Messi, arguably soccer&#8217;s biggest superstar, has, however, been associated with a far more dodgy product too. Peruvian police earlier this week seized $85 million (R1.6 billion) worth of cocaine that had the Barcelona play-maker&#8217;s portrait as well as his branding on it. The haul totalled 1.4 kg and 1288 packages and was hidden in a container of frozen fish. https://twitter.com/Sporf/status/844942562288963584 Image: Police in Peru have seized 1,417 kilograms of Cocaine worth 85m with the photos of Messi on it.
