While five ministers lost their jobs, the new minister of finance was celebrating his new portfolio at the Cape Town International Jazz festival. By the looks of wife Norma Gigaba&#8217;s Instagram account, he is on top of the world and clearly happy about his promotion to heading one of the most powerful and influential ministries in government and the country. While Gigaba holds no experience or educational qualifications relating to this ministry, he has been lauded for bringing youthful vigour to the Cabinet. The snazzy dresser, who enjoys social media, is likely spending the weekend in the Mother City with his wife, as the jazz festival is a four-day event. &nbsp; #topdeck &#x1f36b; &#x1f389; #fashion&amp;allthatjazz &#8230;galadinner A post shared by Norma Gigaba (@norma.gigaba) on Mar 30, 2017 at 11:00am PDT SACTWU Fashion Show at the CTICC #wearsouthafrica dressed by @scalodesigner &#x1f483;&#x1f3fc;&#x1f64c;&#x1f3fd;#glamxfestjazz A post shared by Norma Gigaba (@norma.gigaba) on Mar 30, 2017 at 10:55am PDT #pricelessmoments #fatheranddaughtermoments #StCypriansClassof2017 &#x1f389;&#x1f389;&#x1f389;&#x1f483;&#x1f3fc;&#x1f483;&#x1f3fc;, thank you @gavinrajah for making my angel looking simple and elegant &#x1f64c;&#x1f3fd;&#x1f451; A post shared by Norma Gigaba (@norma.gigaba) on Mar 30, 2017 at 9:58am PDT ALSO READ: Malusi Gigaba is the new finance minister For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
