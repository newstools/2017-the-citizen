 Nando s has for the last 30 years subscribed to the notion that laughter really is the best medicine, while the Savanna Comics Choice Awards has created better opportunities for local comedians over the past six years. Nando s and the Savanna Comics Choice Awards are both at the forefront of keeping South Africans laughing and are a match made in comedy heaven, which is why we are delighted to announce that we will be partnering with the 2017 Savanna Comics Choice Awards, says Doug Place, Nando s chief marketing officer. The awards will take place at the Lyric Theatre at Gold Reef City in September 2017. The theme for the awards is Freedom of Funny . Says Place: As a company that is committed to encouraging laughter and protecting the right to make South Africans laugh, we admire the courage, passion and pride that drives comedians to produce material that embraces difference, surprises and delights, and is consciously original. Nurturing talent is a key part of our brand and this is the perfect platform to extend that sentiment. Place says Nando s is also sponsoring the Best Friend of Comedy A ward for 2017. This award is made to the individual, group, organisation, media platform, brand, agency or other entity that has provided support, facilitated or championed South African comedy significantly in the past 12 months.
