In my practice as an oncologist, I am often questioned by my patients, What actually causes cancer? This is natural. Patients are usually in shock after receiving the news of their new diagnosis, and, this prompts curiosity.As part of my duties, I have to calm the patients down. I am also duty-bound to satisfy their curiosity by providing answers to their questions.I do this, knowing that the treatment for any cancer is not limited to surgery and chemotherapy but also preparation of my patients mind.So, my answers are usually specific to the patient I care not to hurt them though. I try to work as counselor, a friend and a doctor.What actually causes cancer?There are several causes of cancer known today. They include radiation, viruses; and chemicals, some lifestyles habits like cigarette smoking, poor diet and physical inactivity.In some cases, the cancers have occurred due to the genetic makeup of an individual and hence there are those malignancies which can run in families.It was widely believed that for those cancers running in families, the ancestors were to blame for passing on bad traits to their generations.But now, we all know that for the genes to express themselves and cause cancer, there must be an interaction of the genes with the environment.In 1863 a renowned pathologist, Rudolf Virchow, observed a common pattern in which many cancer patients developed a tumour on the spot that had received a blow or where an object was rubbed repeatedly. In his lab, he observed the presence of white cells in cancerous growths at those injured areas.He came to believe and later advanced a hypothesis that the cancers developed during the process of wound repair. He claimed that as the natural process was taking place to restore the body tissue to normal shape, and that something went wrong and the repair turned into a cancer.This hypothesis was ridiculed by other scientists till 130 years later in Havard Medical School where Harold Dvorak forcefully argued in support.In his article, the Harvard scientist claimed that one in six cancers was directly linked to a chronic inflammation.Inflammation means a physical condition in which part of the body becomes reddened, swollen, hot, and often painful, especially as a reaction to injury or infection.Today, we have many cancers that follow this pattern, such as cervical cancer; which is attributed to Human papilloma Virus (HPV) or stomach cancer which is attributed to a bacterium, Helicobacter Pylori.Colon cancer patients have also been known to suffer from several chronic inflammatory diseases of the intestines.Cancer of the liver is linked to infection by hepatitis B and C viruses.Mesothelioma, another cancer was linked to the asbestos rock while lung cancer is due to the inflammation caused by the additives in cigarette smoking.What actually happens is that after the damage on the body tissues, the immune cells (body defense cells) gear up for the challenge.They produce substances known biologically as cytokines, prostaglandins and leukotrienes. These substances increase the inflammatory process but are also used in repairing the wound.As the cells carry out that process, they are likely to make cancer cells grow more. So, you can see that for cancer to occur, it exploits an existing natural mechanism.It has therefore dawned on oncologists that inflammation in cancer care should always be taken into consideration in assessing the causes of certain cancers.It can be used to predict the likelihood of recovery because, the more the inflammation, the more aggressive the cancer is.The link between inflammation and cancer has opened up a window for not only prevention but also treatment of cancer.
