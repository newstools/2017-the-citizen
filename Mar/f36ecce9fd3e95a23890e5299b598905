Kiernan &#8216;AKA&#8217; Forbes has changed, and his followers have noticed. The rapper would always trend for trolling his followers and other artists, especially Cassper Nyovest, who he at one point admitted to slapping at a club. Though drama always finds its way into his life, he has apparently been handling it a lot better lately. One of his Twitter followers said he had become more mature, caring and loving and gave all the credit to his girlfriend, Bonang Matheba, who is not really a fan of drama. According to the follower, the change was nothing like they had imagined. Though Bonang agreed with the follower, she refused to take credit for the change and said her boyfriend had always been like that. He&#39;s always been that way&#8230; Trust me. https://t.co/5OYBGNYiek &mdash; Bonang B* Matheba (@bonang_m) March 8, 2017 The Caiphus Song hit maker on Tuesday came to the rescue of his friend Simiso Okmalumkoolkat Zwane after a City Press headline that read AKA collaborates with convicted sex offender Okmalumkoolkat on new cover . In a series of tweets, AKA said the publication was making its agenda too obvious by writing the headline now that Okmalumkoolkat had worked with him, when he had also worked on other projects since his release from prison without being disparaged. Okmalumkoolkat designed the artwork for AKA s latest single, Caiphus Song. Though he has admitted Okmalumkoolkat made a mistake, he says the artist has been punished and is still paying for it, further clarifying that the rapper never raped anyone. That man owes nobody an explanation except for the victim, his own child and his family. The rest of you self righteous rubbishes can go jump!
