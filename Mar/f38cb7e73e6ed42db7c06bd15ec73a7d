Blind, 55, had been in charge since July 2015, succeeding Guus Hiddink, but Saturday&#8217;s loss in Sofia left the Dutch in fourth place in qualifying Group A, six points behind leaders France. Only the group winners are guaranteed a place in the 2018 finals in Russia. Blind&#8217;s assistant Fred Grim will take charge of the team for Tuesday&#8217;s friendly against Italy in Amsterdam, the Dutch football federation (KNVB) said. &#8220;We (the federation) have a lot of respect for Danny, but due to negative results and the difficulty we have to qualify for the 2018 World Cup, we must part company with him,&#8221; said the KNVB in a statement. The Netherlands, three-times World Cup runners-up, also failed to qualify for Euro 2016. &#8220;To qualify for Russia will be very complicated,&#8221; admitted star midfielder Wesley Sneijder.
