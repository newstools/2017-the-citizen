The first steps of what promises to be a new and more intricate political path for this country were taken over the past few days. The calls continue to ring loud for the DA s Western Province premier, Helen Zille, to resign over her tweet about the positive influences of colonialism. Not least of the voices raised in the uproar which followed was that of her own party leader, Musi Maimane. The long-term effect on the efficacy of the DA is still to be measured, but there can be little doubt that there will be a reaction among the voters. The second was the official launching of the newly registered South African Federation of Trade Unions (Saftu) under former kingpin of rival trade union federation Cosatu Zwelinzima Vavi. Vavi promises it will be a game changer and paves the way for the birth of a vibrant, independent, democratic and militant workers champion, which will turn the tide against exploitation, mass unemployment, poverty and inequality and take us forward to the total liberation of the working class . If Vavi and the new federation continue to gain momentum, political clout will inexorably follow the path Saftu has chosen and if this is taken to the polls, it could have significant effect.
