The 23rd instalment of the South African Music Awards (Samas) will be held at the Sun City Superbowl, organisers announced on Monday. This after the hosting venue for the awards was moved to Durban last year while the Superbowl underwent a multimillion-rand revamp. Recording Industry of South Africa (RiSA) CEO Nhlanhla Sibisi commented on the exciting return to Sun City. &#8220;It&#8217;s such a delight to be returning to Sun City. The convenience it brings during a weekend of celebration makes it the ideal location for us. Sibisi also invited music lovers to join the industry as it makes the trip to the luxury resort for a &#8220;party fit for our country and the continent&#8217;s finest musicians&#8221;. The music awards have been hosted a whopping 14 times at Sun City since the awards ceremony was launched in 1994. The North West government also expressed excitement at the return of the glittery awards to Sun City. The government said hosting the events would offer an &#8220;unforgettable experience&#8221; for those attending. &#8220;We are delighted that this will contribute significantly to our Rebranding, Repositioning and Renewal strategy through Agriculture, Culture and Tourism,&#8221; the government said. The Samas will be held on the weekend of May 26 2017. Riky Rick leaves Mabala Noise, accuses them of taking back gifts For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
