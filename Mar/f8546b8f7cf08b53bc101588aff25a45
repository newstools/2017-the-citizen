Ithala Bank has denied the allegations made by Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini that it owed the South Africa Social Security Agency (Sassa) more than R1 billion. This comes after Dlamini on Tuesday told the Parliament s Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) that her department was not in favour of using commercial banks to take over the payment function of social grants, as they had behaved improperly in the past. Dlamini said Standard Bank owed Sassa about R500 million and that Ithala Bank owed about R1.1 billion over dormant accounts, including interest held back by both institutions. However, Ithala chief executive Peter Ireland denied Dlamini s R1 billion debt allegations, saying the bank had no liability to the social security agency. Ithala can confirm that it does not owe the South Africa Social Security Agency any money. Ithala therefore has no liability to Sassa, Ireland said in a statement. Any queries pertaining to the allegation of money being owed by Ithala must be directed to either the minister s office or Sassa. Sassa has come under the spotlight over the payment of social grants to more than 17 million beneficiaries because the contract with Cash Pay Services ends in just over two weeks, and no new deal has been signed. This has raised the ire political parties and civil rights groups who demand answers as to why Sassa failed to implement its undertaking to take over the payment function from April. They also want Dlamini to step down. Last week, social development director-general Zane Dangor resigned over the Sassa debacle. The Constitutional Court has since given Sassa until Monday to answer a number of questions about grant payments. Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng issued the directives on Wednesday. Sassa must provide information on who was responsible for deciding that the agency cannot pay grants itself after March 2017, and the date when that person became aware that Sassa could not do so.
