In an interview with Drum magazine, Ayanda said Sfiso&#8217;s mother Fikile hadn&#8217;t checked up on her and her two sons since the funeral last December. The two haven&#8217;t had a close relationship even while Sfiso was alive, with him telling Drum at one point that his mother had bad spirits or zombies in her home, and he and Ayanda couldn&#8217;t visit her because of that. Fikile also accused Sfiso of not supporting her financially, saying she had nothing in her fridge while he bought his pastor a car worth more than R1 million. At the time of Sfiso&#8217;s passing, however, the family tried to reunite and put up a brave face while dealing with funeral arrangements. On the day of the funeral, this fell apart as Sfiso&#8217;s sister and other relatives walked out of Moses Mabhida, citing not being allocated proper seating and having to sit in the rain with everyone else. Ayanda revealed she was hurt that their relationship was practically nonexistent. &#8220;She has not checked on us. Sfiso was all about healing through song. I thought the funeral would unite us,&#8221; she said. About reports that Sfiso&#8217;s family were left in the dark about what he died from, Ayanda said they should call her. &#8220;If family members want to know something they know what to do. I will not disrespect my husband and publish his postmortem report,&#8221; she said.
