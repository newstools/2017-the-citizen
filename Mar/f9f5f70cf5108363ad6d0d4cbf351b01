ANC Youth League treasurer Reggie Nkabinde&#8217;s record label, Mabala Noise, is so big that even the heavens would have decided to sign Jesus to the label if he were still walking on this earth. Without meaning to offend Christians because his &#8220;mama taught me better than that&#8221;, winner of the first season of Big Brother Mzansi Mandla Hlatshwayo said he had used Jesus as an example because the stable seems to have signed everyone. &#8220;No blasphemy intended&#8230;it just seems like anyone who&#8217;s anyone is over there&#8230;hence the comparison of the iconic two.&#8221; If Jesus was alive he&#39;d probably be signed to Mabala Noise&#8230;#RandomEpipheny &mdash; Mandla (@eenMcloud) March 6, 2017 The record label made headlines last year after signing so many artists that it raised eyebrows. Some of the artists signed to it include Khanyi Mbau, Letoya Makhene, Gigi Lamayne, Kay Sibiya, Major League, Zola, Nasty C and Riky Rick. After its announcement, fans were left wondering what it was about the record label that made almost every artist want to be a part of it. Then EFF leader Julius Malema came along and gave South Africans an explanation. Last year, he alleged at a press conference that an amount of R5 million was apparently being paid to Mabala Noise artists, which is owned by Nkabinde. This hefty claim was made by a once ANC insider. Malema made further allegations, accusing Nkabinde of using the record label as a front to launder millions he had received in water and sanitation tenders from Nomvula Mokonyane, the former Gauteng premier, now the water and sanitation minister. Mokonyane was also the head of the ANC s election campaign. Nomvula likes them young. All these boys that are working for and with her are young boys, said Malema. He joked that Nkabinde was getting tenders from Mokonyane s department, as if water has something to do with music. Read more: Malema: Metro FM Awards &#8216;corrupted by Mabala Noise&#8217; &nbsp;
