The 90s R&amp;B quartet visited South Africa on a tour, with performances in Cape Town, Johannesburg and Bloemfontein. Speaking about the experience of sharing a stage with his childhood heroes, Louw said: The two nights sharing with All 4 One were just magical. They are such humble guys and gave me advice on how it s crucial to be myself &#8230; They are so consistent and the reception was mind-blowing at Grandwest and at Carnival. I still get shocked the crowd reacts to me. Sometimes they give this confusing stare as If I&#8217;m not the one singing. In all that, who am I to complain to share the stage with Grammy-Award winners right at the takeoff of my career? Louw was discovered during his time on the reality competition on Mzansi Magic&#8217;s SA Idols show. They spotted my performance of their song &#8216;These Arms&#8217; On Idols season 12, and they reposted my video and said when they come to the country they would like it if I joined on stage. The young singer&#8217;s crowd-pleasing performance included a tribute to late Kwaito star Mandoza as well as other pop classic hits from his time on the season 12 of the reality show. &#8211; For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
