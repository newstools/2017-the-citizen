President Jacob Zuma and Sport and Recreation Minister Fikile Mbalulu on Sunday expressed sadness at the death of founder and former owner of Bloemfontein Celtic Football Club Petrus Molemela. The history of football in South Africa is rich with contributions from legends like Dr Molemela, Mbalula said in a statement. His sad passing [re]presents a huge loss in the football fraternity. We can draw lessons from his life that was an inspiration and motivation to work hard in the development of football. In 2012, the department of Sport and Recreation SA honored Dr Molemela with a lifetime achievement award in recognition of his immense contribution. Recently, with the premier of [the] Free State, we opened an upgraded stadium in Bloemfontein named after him. It is these among many accolades that demonstrate the legend that he was. More to this, I am happy that we had an opportunity to celebrate his contribution when he was still with us, he said. Mbalula expressed his deepest condolences to the family and friends of Molemela and to the entire football fraternity. In another statement, Zuma also extended his heartfelt condolences. We have lost a legend who was dedicated to sport and who has made an immense contribution to South African football. We wish to convey our deepest condolences to the Molemela family. May his soul rest in peace, he said.
