Less than 24 hours after the publication of her collaboration with Levis Strauss SA on their new Levi s 501 Skinny s online campaign, rising star rapper Rouge Barbara Wedi reveals that she will be teaming up with cosmetic giant MAC (South Africa) as their new influencer and personality for the launch of their new Shadescents Ruby Woo lipstick range. The stars are truly aligned for the young rapper, whose talent and beauty have caught the eye of major brands such as Levis, MAC and Adidas, who have each asked the young rapper to serve on their upcoming campaigns for 2017. Rouge represents the new generation of young, creative and powerful women changing the face of African hip-hop while remaining true to her authentic self, so it s only fitting for these large brands to want to collaborate with such a dynamic, energetic and clearly bankable young artist. When asked about the new collaborations, Rouge stated that It s a blessing; it has been really eye opening for me to work with such well-known brands who feel I have style and an energy that fits the respective brands! While the Levi s 501 Skinny s will be available in all Levi stores and major retailers nationwide, MAC has created an offer code which gives her fans and social media followers all 6 Shadescents fragrance samples for free with any purchase on the MAC website.
