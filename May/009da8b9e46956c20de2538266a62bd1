Police Minister Fikile Mbalula has been listening and responding to people&#8217;s requests on Twitter, and also informing them of the progress made by police in responding to cases that have been reported. However, the minister has one problem: not being able to be everywhere at the same time. Responding to a user who asked him to visit Manenberg, Hanover Park and Mitchells Plain, Mbalula said he could not be everywhere at once. &#8220;I wish I was the Holy Spirit and be everywhere with everyone at once but I can&#8217;t,&#8221; he said, further promising to visit more places. Following his appointment as police minister in March, Mbalula promised South Africans there would not be any dysfunctional police stations in South Africa no more naps for those cops who take them while on duty, as Mbalula said they would be responsive to the safety and security of the people. He also warned the owners of night clubs, saying there would be random drug searches. Owners of night clubs must take responsibility in the fight against drugs &#8230; No to Drugs. The minister has further urged South Africans to help report crime, as police could not do it alone. If you feel that you cannot go to a police station, just inbox the minister. Some have reported cases to the minister and he told people on Twitter about it, making fun of them. He said he had received complaints from people who said nyaope addicts had snatched their weaves. &#8220;I&#8217;m shook at this, it&#8217;s a new development,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Hoping these aren&#8217;t Bra Hugh Masekela&#8217;s prayers being answered,&#8221; he joked. Masekela is famous for refusing to take photographs with black women wearing weaves as he believes they aren&#8217;t being true to African traditions.
