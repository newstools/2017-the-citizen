Muntari was sent off last week for leaving the field after claiming he was racially abused during a Serie A game against Cagliari. The 32-year-old, who was initially booked for dissent, had his suspension overturned, but the former Inter Milan star believes racism is &#8220;everywhere and getting worse&#8221; and he is determined to take a stand. &#8220;I went through hell and was treated like a criminal,&#8221; he told BBC Sport on Monday. &#8220;I went off the field because it wasn&#8217;t right for me to be on the field while I have been racially abused. &#8220;If I had this problem today, tomorrow or the next game I would go off again.&#8221; Muntari called on FIFA president Gianni Infantino to do more to clampdown on the evil of racism in football. &#8220;I think he is capable of doing something in a good way to fight racism. I want him to fight racism,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I never heard anything like that in England because I think they don&#8217;t tolerate it. &#8220;England is the example for the world. If a country doesn&#8217;t tolerate it then it means you get rid of it.&#8221;
