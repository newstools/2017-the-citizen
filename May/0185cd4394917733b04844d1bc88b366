A good showing from Sir Duke in today s final leg of the WSB East Cape Poly Challenge (Non-Black Type) will guarantee him the R50 000 consolation bonus. No runner can win all three legs as Juan Two Three, who thrashed the opposition in the first leg over 1200m did not run in the second leg over 1400m. But the rules have allowed for a consolation bonus to the horse who earns the most points over the three legs. The one proviso is that the runner has to have won at least one of the legs. That has left Tara Laing-trained Sir Duke almost unstoppable in his quest to collect the windfall. He was runner-up behind Juan Two Three over 1200m and then sneaked in front of Peach Delight to win the second leg over 1400m. Peach Delight is not running in this race and the only runner who has an iota of a chance to catch him is Kiss Me Hardy but he would have to win this race and Sir Duke would have to run a complete shocker. Sir Duke has not won over 1600m on the Polytrack but in his three starts over the course and distance has placed in all of them. In addition he has Callan Murray in the irons and he is riding with such confidence at the moment that owners Mayfair Speculators can start writing out the deposit slip. However, that does not mean the son of Trippi will win this race. Justin Snaith saddles Jet Explorer and he is unbeaten in two starts over the course and distance. With Piere Strydom in the irons for the first time the eight-year-old son of Jet Master looks likely to keep his unbeaten record intact. Although badly under sufferance under the race conditions Our Icon from the Alan Greeff yard could take third place.
