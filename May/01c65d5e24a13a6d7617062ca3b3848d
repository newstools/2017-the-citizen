Bulls coach Nollis Marais was once again bemoaning his side s lack of clinical finishing, but he had an added complaint about the unpunished lawlessness of the Hurricanes after the defending champions beat them 34-20 in their Super Rugby match in Pretoria at the weekend. The Bulls enjoyed 60% territory and 57% possession in the match, but were outscored by five tries to two.

Referee Egon Seconds did not produce a single card in the whole game and the Hurricanes defensive line were allowed to camp offside and they also killed the Bulls attacks illegally. At certain stages the Hurricanes gave away too many penalties in their own 22 and we should have had more reward from that, said Marais. In the end though, it was the same old story, we played well and we created enough opportunities, but we just could not convert. Under pressure we made mistakes and we have missed a lot of tackles this season, they caught out our inexperienced players at times. The defensive errors will come if you give a very dangerous side like the Hurricanes too much momentum and ball. The embattled Bulls coach, who has been demoted with the arrival of John Mitchell as the Executive of Rugby, said he was proud of the character his side showed, however, in an improved display. We showed a lot of character. After the last four weeks, the players had to decide what to do, it was up to them to determine what people think of them. That attitude came out, they were in the fight, Marais said. For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
