Although nothing has been said regarding Dj Zinhle&#8217;s boyfriends pending case, we do know that she might be cooking up a new reality show. Radio and TV personality Bonang Matheba announced earlier this year that she would be giving her fans a closer look into her glamorous life. The reality show is set to feature boyfriend AKA and will broadcast on Vuzu AMP this July. Dj Zinhle has had her fair share of drama with Bonang Matheba and baby daddy AKA over the past two years. It appears the drama is over, but what could two reality shows mean for the trio? &nbsp; No babe. I&#39;m home with a crew filming a new reality show. I don&#39;t have bad luck either. We all know that Move writes lies.. Bad luck? https://t.co/4ELNqlm3Ys &mdash; #djzinhlecolours (@DJZinhle) May 3, 2017 Anyway, I need to get back to work. Can&#39;t keep the crew &amp; ancestors waiting. &mdash; #djzinhlecolours (@DJZinhle) May 3, 2017 ALSO READ: Bonang gets a reality show on Vuzu For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
