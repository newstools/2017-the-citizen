Lowly Huddersfield dramatically gained promotion to the English Premier League next season following a 4-3 penalty shootout win over Reading on Monday evening. The match ended scoreless after extra time. Despite the obvious heartache for the Reading players, one spot kick would&#8217;ve brought back particularly nasty memories for manager Jaap Stam. In Euro 2000, Stam skied one of the Netherlands&#8217; penalties in the semifinal shootout against Italy, costing them a place in the final. 17 years later, he saw his right-back Liam Moore do exactly the same thing&#8230; (Liam Moore&#8217;s penalty is at 1:16 of the video) Moore&#8217;s miss placed undue pressure on Jordan Obita, who had a tame shot saved by Huddersfield keeper Danny Ward.
