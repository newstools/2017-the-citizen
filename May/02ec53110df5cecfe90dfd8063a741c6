At least 23 people died and 11 more were seriously injured Saturday when a bus carrying women and children plunged off a cliff near the southwestern Turkish sea resort of Marmaris. &#8220;Sadly, we have had 20 fatalities and 11 other seriously injured,&#8221; said Amir Cicek, the governor of Mugla province, calling it a &#8220;horrible accident.&#8221; His deputy Kamil Koten said the bus plunged through a crash barrier and fell 15 metres (50 feet) on to a lower road, smashing a car with its three occupants. &#8220;If we count these three deaths, the number of the dead rises to 23,&#8221; the state-run Anadolu news agency quoted him as saying. The accident occurred near the Sakar Pass on a steep winding road filled with hairpin bends. Cicek told NTV television an investigation was under way. &#8220;The bus&#8217;s brakes may have malfunctioned,&#8221; he said. Television images showed the yellow bus lying on its side and bodies wrapped up in cloth lined up next to it. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, currently on a visit to China, said he was &#8220;extremely pained&#8221; by the tragedy and asked local authorities to take measures to ensure that &#8220;such tragedies&#8221; do not recur. The Hurriyet newspaper quoted Marmaris mayor Ali Acar as indicating an &#8220;error by the driver&#8221;, without giving further details. Other media outlets reported that the bus left from the western city of Izmir carrying only women and children who were on a trip for Mothers&#8217; Day, celebrated in Turkey on Sunday. Marmaris is one of the country&#8217;s main resorts on the Mediterranean, and a popular weekend destination for many Turks as temperatures climb.
