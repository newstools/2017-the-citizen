This last weekend has seen some reputations boosted and others blasted and that has resulted in a change to the betting for the R4.25-million Vodacom Durban July over 2200m at Greyville on Saturday 1 July. The first announcement to come out yesterday morning was the scratching of Hat Puntano, the Argentinian-bred three-year-old who was supplemented into the race earlier this month by Mike Azzie. No reason was given for his withdrawal. Going into the weekend the big talking point was around Elusive Silva, the Justin Snaith-trained gelding who started a well-backed 18-10 to win the Grade 2 Betting World 1900 at Greyville on Friday night. He ended up in fifth place, beaten 3.25 lengths by Ten Gun Salute, who was easy to back at 40-1. Elusive Silva was available at 7-1 for the July prior to the Grey ville 1900 but has drifted to 10-1 with Betting World. Ten Gun Salute has shortened from 66-1 to 25-1, while third-placed It s My Turn is now 14-1 from 16-1. Another runner who short ened markedly is Nebula, who was on offer at 100-1 earlier but is now at 18-1 following his win in Race 9 at Greyville on Friday night. Jockey Donovan Dillon was full of praise for Brett Crawford s charge following his 1.25-length victory over Baritone in a Pinna cle Stakes over 1600m. What a horse! That&#8217;s all I can say, honest ly! he commented on Facebook after the full brother to Met win ner Martial Eagle cruised home.
