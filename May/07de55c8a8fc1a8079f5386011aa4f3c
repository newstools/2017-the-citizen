Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) deputy president Floyd Shivambu married Siphesihle Pezi in a traditional wedding ceremony at Mahosini village, outside Malamulele, in Limpopo, on Saturday, and from the videos and pictures that have been shared on social media, it is clear fun was had. If there is one thing EFF leaders know what to do, it is to celebrate, and love always takes priority. In a video that EFF leader Julius Malema shared on Twitter, he, along with with the national spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi and national chairperson Dali Mpofu, can be seen trying to keep up with the Tsonga music. We knew Nldozi could dance and sing, but no one had actually seen Malema and Mpofu dance, and to Tsonga music, for that matter. We must say, they killed it. Watch the video below: @BennyMayengani is dangerous getting @AdvDali_Mpofu,@MbuyiseniNdlozi and CIC @Julius_S_Malema to dance like this iyaaaaa ditlabowa maaan pic.twitter.com/sq1M1GbqMD &mdash; Ntobeng Ntobeng (@ntobengndo) May 1, 2017 ALSO READ: PICS: Floyd Shivambu ties the knot to his ANC bride
