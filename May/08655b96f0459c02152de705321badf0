Springbok coach Allister Coetzee on Tuesday named a Springbok squad mixing the good with the confusing. He undoubtedly made the right decision in naming Warren Whiteley as the national side&#8217;s new captain but who else did he pick that can be considered a &#8220;win&#8221;. And who were his stranger picks? THE HITS Frans Steyn: The 30-year-old utility back still divides opinion because he&#8217;s one of South Africa&#8217;s more misunderstood players. He&#8217;s been switched around too much in his career but there&#8217;s enough evidence to suggest he&#8217;s a fine player when there&#8217;s a specific role for him. Steyn knew where he stood under former Bok coaches Jake White and Heyneke Meyer and repaid them with good performances. Given his fall-out with Saru four years ago, it must say something about his commitment that he wants to play international rugby again. Lukhanyo Am: The 23-year-old Sharks centre has been one of the finds of the Super Rugby campaign. He probably won&#8217;t play in the series against France barring injuries but don&#8217;t for one moment think Am&#8217;s inclusion is politically motivated. He&#8217;s thrived under Sharks coach Robert du Preez&#8217;s more practical game plan, combining excellent defence with good playmaking skills. In fact, Am&#8217;s expected to play the kind of rugby at the Sharks that one can expect at Test level too &#8211; and that makes him a good fit for the Boks in future. Duane Vermeulen: Yes, he&#8217;s already 30 but Vermeulen hasn&#8217;t lost his edge. South African rugby isn&#8217;t blessed with experienced, big ball-carrying flankers and that&#8217;s why his availability is good news, In time, promising youngsters like Jean-Luc du Preez and Ruan Ackermann will come through yet for now fans should rejoice the plan to let Vermeulen play No 7. He&#8217;ll be a fine senior player. THE MISSES Lood de Jager: Granted, the towering lock has been playing a poor Bulls side this year though the fact that De Jager has failed in the last 18 months to regain his form from 2015 tells a story. Either he&#8217;s in a really long slump or his ability is being overestimated. Nonetheless, how he&#8217;s being picked above players like the Sharks&#8217; Ruan Botha is a mystery. Damian de Allende: There&#8217;s precious little science to his selection. The mercurial midfielder has only played 28 minutes since his return from an ankle injury when the Bulls&#8217; Burger Odendaal and Lions&#8217; Harold Vorster have been performing with compelling impact. It&#8217;s not as if De Allende had a storming season in 2016, so this pick seems to have been made with loyalty and familiarity in mind rather than form. Rudy Paige: Yet another selection where form clearly wasn&#8217;t important. The Bulls scrumhalf has been treated badly since being unexpectedly picked for the 2015 World Cup and has lost much of his confidence. It hasn&#8217;t returned recently and the must-win series also isn&#8217;t the place to hope it does. &nbsp; &nbsp;
