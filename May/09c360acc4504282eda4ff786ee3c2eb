South African rugby mirrors South African society at the moment. There are a few bright spots but you don&#8217;t really highlight them because the gloom is too widespread. After all, there was the massacre at Loftus; another Stormers defeat and the mother of all chokes in Bloemfontein. But let&#8217;s at least try to remember the Lions look unstoppable and that the Sharks have unleashed a new gem of a wing. Nollis remains defiant In a period of massive uncertainty for the Bulls, there&#8217;s one thing you can be assured of: Nollis Marais won&#8217;t walk out on his own. Following a record-breaking defeat of Loftus to the Crusaders &#8211; 62-24 &#8211; the pressure has almost become unmanageable. But Marais is philosophical. &#8220;That&#8217;s a decision (the decision to get fired) that I can&#8217;t make and there are two coaches in life: It&#8217;s the one who is fired and the one who is going to get fired &#8221; he said. &#8220;The only thing I can do now is to focus on the team getting ready. I know there are unhappy people and I can accept that. Whatever happens now is a board decision and whatever decision that is made I&#8217;ll accept.&#8221; The Bulls mentor is a feisty, honest man who won&#8217;t back down but his insistence that there&#8217;s still a vision the Bulls are working towards will have many sceptical. &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t mistaken when I went to the board and explained to them the way I wanted to play this is the plan and this is the way forward in terms of how I want to play &#8221; said Marais. &#8220;I&#8217;ll stick to that because I have a certain way and a certain belief in terms of how I want the team to play even though that&#8217;s not the case at the moment. I&#8217;ve always had results in every team that I&#8217;ve coached.&#8221; The Sharks discover a gem Coach Robert du Preez isn&#8217;t a man that gets too excited about things. That&#8217;s why 21-year-old S&#8217;bu Nkosi&#8217;s debut against the Force must&#8217;ve been special. The rookie winger did indeed enjoy an outstanding outing. He missed out a magnificent, side-stepping try due to a forward pass but it didn&#8217;t affect him one bit. Nkosi kept his work rate up, attacked well and, vitally, showed himself to be a very good defender. &#8220;I&#8217;m very happy,&#8221; said Du Preez. &#8220;He&#8217;s a guy who has impressed us in pre-season. He is very dedicated. I thought he had a very good first Super Rugby game. He made the right decisions. It was a good start for him.&#8221; Rampant Lions aren&#8217;t too concerned over the &#8216;New Zealand&#8217; factor Johan Ackermann&#8217;s troops are the only men keeping certain rugby fans sane. They continue to show the strength of their culture and the clarity of the way they want to play. But some are wondering how the Lions will shape when they face New Zealand opposition in the play-offs. Remember, that&#8217;s the first time they&#8217;ll do so in 2017. &#8220;It&#8217;s up to us to ensure our training and intensity stays up to standard against the New Zealand sides later,&#8221; said Ackermann, after the 47-10 win over the Rebels. &#8220;It will be disappointing if we don&#8217;t play at that level when we receive that honour. But there are enough players with experience of last year&#8217;s campaign. They know how to win quarterfinals and semifinals against the Crusaders and Highlanders. We&#8217;ll draw on that. Also, we&#8217;re still not playing the best rugby in 2017 to date.&#8221; Scary but a valid thought. For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
