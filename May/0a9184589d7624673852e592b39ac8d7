A man was killed and another was critically injured when two trucks collided head-on on the N3 in Van Reenen s Pass in KwaZulu-Natal early on Saturday morning, paramedics said. ER24 paramedics, along with another service, arrived on the scene to find two trucks on the side of the road. One of the trucks had burst into flames, ER24 spokesman Russel Meiring said. Fire services were on the scene to extinguish the blaze, taking a few short minutes. Upon closer inspection, paramedics discovered the body of a man lying inside the smoldering wreckage. Unfortunately, nothing could be done for the man and he was declared dead. The driver of the second truck was assessed and found to be in a critical condition. Paramedics treated the man and provided him with advanced life support interventions. He was thereafter transported to a nearby hospital for further treatment. The cause of the collision was not yet known but local authorities were on the scene for further investigations, Meiring said.
