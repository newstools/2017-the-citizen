It is mind-boggling to learn that of the state s R600 billion budget, 40% is eroded by fraud and inflated prices from suppliers. It is even more frightening to learn that Treasury unearthed 12 000 dead people in its register of companies that do business with the state during the clean-up of Treasury s information system. This came to light in an exercise to curb spending by the section s acting head, Schalk Human. Also jaw-dropping was the revelation that 14 000 state employees are listed as directors of companies awarded state contracts in violation of regulations. This all points to mismanagement of state resources and corruption on a grand scale. As much as R240 billion is being creamed off for the self-enrichment of the elite few at the cost of the increasingly unhappy, financially disenfranchised masses, whose protests have grown even more violent as promises of service delivery have failed to materialise. Treasury has vowed to pursue the miscreants and subject their findings to the courts. But we would suggest this is a task that could prove to be beyond them. And in the case of the deceased individuals, who are they going to call? Ghostbusters?
