About a year ago, former Dolphins coach and Proteas legend Lance Klusener looked at a dejected Khaya Zondo. He knew how his upcoming batter was hurting. Zondo had been treated harshly by the Proteas selectors on the 2015 tour of India, where they picked him as the extra batsman in the one-day squad.

Instead, South Africa flew up Test opener Dean Elgar &#8211; who hadn&#8217;t been in the squad &#8211; to fill the void. &#8220;I was going through a bad slump after that tour,&#8221; Zondo revealed this week. &#8220;Lance cares deeply about his players but he has a quirky way of saying things. &#8220;He came to me and said: &#8216;You&#8217;re burning in the fire now, but don&#8217;t worry. You&#8217;ll come out a beautiful roast chicken.&#8217; &#8221; It was a crude way of consoling Zondo but it also played a huge part in the spiritual journey of the Dolphins captain, who&#8217;s now in England skippering the South Africa &#8216;A&#8217; one-day side. More importantly, he&#8217;s again being considered as one of South African cricket&#8217;s most accomplished black batsmen. &#8220;I am obviously happy with the way I&#8217;ve been performing. Two seasons ago was difficult, I felt very alone but that s in the past,&#8221; said Zondo. &#8220;The only thing that really upset me was the disappointment. I felt the dream was within touching distance. I actually thought: &#8216;I m here, I m going to do this&#8217;. And then suddenly, it didn&#8217;t happen. That&#8217;s what disappointed me, not the players or management.&#8221; The 27-year-old from Westville cites another mentor, whom he declines to name, as a huge influence in him regaining his confidence. &#8220;I was told that the world owes you nothing, whether it s right or wrong,&#8221; said Zondo. &#8220;I then realised it is what it is and that it can t be changed. The only thing I can do now is grow as a cricketer, no matter what happens.&#8221; This past season, Zondo scored 740 runs at an average of 67 in the domestic four-day competition and then flourished further in the 50-over format as Dolphins skipper. &#8220;Captaincy helped my game. I now know I won t go out and try to hack the ball. It helps me focus more, I like leading from the front,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Obviously I d love to captain the Proteas one day. I think any player would like that privilege. But it has to be earned. You ve got to make sure you re a good leader and when you get there, you have to be tested. I can t get there and learn on the job.&#8221; Now wouldn&#8217;t that be Zondo coming full circle? For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
