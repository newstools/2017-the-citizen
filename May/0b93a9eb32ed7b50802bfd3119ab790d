KPMG has acquired Matchi, a leading global fintech innovation and matchmaking platform that connects financial institutions with fintech solutions and companies worldwide, the company said on Wednesday. The Matchi platform includes more than 700 curated fintech solutions and a database of more than 2 500 fintech companies that financial institutions can work with to apply innovative fintech capabilities to solving their business problems and pursuing new market opportunities. Financial institutions can search for a specific company or solution, or they can use the platform s Innovation Challenge capability to present specific challenges to the global fintech market and receive recommendations on solutions from fintech innovators. Pierre Fourie, financial services director for KPMG in South Africa, said: The Matchi platform offers a curated approach that is much more rigorous than fintech databases that merely provide lists. Its design makes it easy to identify, match and enable collaboration with the most innovative fintechs and global solutions to address the most pressing needs of clients. We are in the unique position in South Africa in that the Matchi skills are based here. Since its inception in 2013, Matchi has connected more than 100 leading banks and insurance companies with fintech innovations, including solutions in next generation payments, regtech, blockchain and P2P insurance. Matchi chief executive David Milligan said combining the platform with the exceptional knowledge and skills of KPMG professionals created a powerful fintech resource. Together we are positioned to help clients find and deploy the fintech solutions that are most relevant to their business needs, Milligan said. We are fulfilling the promise of collaboration between financial institutions and fintech firms, which can ultimately benefit all consumers and businesses.
