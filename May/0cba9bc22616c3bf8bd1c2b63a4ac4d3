Eritrean rider Daniel Teklehaimanot earned the King of the Mountains jersey on Saturday, while Italian Kristian Sbaragli and South African debutant Ryan Gibbons again secured top-10 finishes, as local outfit Dimension Data continued to make an impact in the early stages of the Giro d&#8217;Italia. Teklehaimanot won both intermediate sprints to emerge as the best of the climbers on the 220km second leg of the three-week Grand Tour race. German rider Andre Greipel (Lotto-Soudal) won a bunch sprint to take the stage victory while Sbaragli and Gibbons finished fifth and seventh respectively, repeating their top-10 performances from the day before. &#8220;It&#8217;s unbelievable to have taken the jersey in the Tour de France (last year) and in this special 100th Giro d&#8217;Italia,&#8221; Teklehaimanot said. &#8220;It is incredible to be on the podium of these Grand Tours and I am very happy today.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
