There was a flood of emotion at the memorial service for the 18 pupils and two adults who were killed in a minibus crash two weeks ago as Minister of Basic Education Angie Motshekga joined other government officials to remember the lives lost in the crash. News24 reports that the two principals of Refano Primary and Mahlenga Senior Secondary respectively broke down in tears and had to be led out of the tent where the memorial was being held in Verena Mpumalanga by nurses and social workers. Motshekga reportedly said she could not find words of comfort at this time and called the incident &#8220;one of the saddest tragedies&#8221;. She said they gave their &#8220;heartfelt condolences&#8221; to the families and reminded them that while the pain would never go away, time would heal. According to News24, 16 pupils would be buried in Mpumalanga on Saturday while the two other pupils would be laid to rest in KwaZulu-Natal and Limpopo respectively.
