Despite the Proteas one-day side hogging the spotlight as they inch closer to next month&#8217;s ICC Champions Trophy campaign, three of South Africa&#8217;s Test specialists have been playing county cricket in England. The form of Dean Elgar, Vernon Philander and Stephen Cook will be very important by the end of next month as the Proteas play the English in a mouthwatering four-Test series.

He made his mark early when he carried his bat in scoring 113 in Somerset&#8217;s second first-class game against Lancashire. Yet it&#8217;s been Elgar&#8217;s purple patch in 50-over cricket that has really caught the eye. Batting at No 4, the left-hander made a career best, unbeaten 131 against Sussex and hasn&#8217;t made a score under 55 in his five one-day innings to date (428 runs at an average of 107). Interestingly, Elgar mentioned after the Test series against Sri Lanka earlier this year that he still has a desire to play one-day cricket for South Africa. He&#8217;s making a decent case. Stephen Cook (Durham) The Highveld Lions veteran is under pressure in the Test side due to a poor run of form last season. Many critics believe the tour of England is his last chance to cement a place. His form in four-day cricket has been patchy &#8211; there have been knocks of 64 and 45 &#8211; but he, like Elgar, Cook&#8217;s done well in the 50-over stuff. He scored a composed 106 against Yorkshire in between scores of 60 and 67. Ironically, in last week&#8217;s four-day game against Sussex, Cook was dismissed twice by a certain Vernon Philander. Vernon Philander (Sussex) The stocky seamer has actually had fans more worried about his fitness than anything else. Philander pulled up last month with a hamstring injury and only returned at the weekend. But his comeback was a good one: he took 2/60 and a confidence-boosting 4/39 &#8211; dismissing Cook twice. The Proteas will hope that wicket-taking habit continues. For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
