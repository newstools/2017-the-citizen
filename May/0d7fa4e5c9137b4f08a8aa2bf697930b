Following the sudden move from debuting recording label Ambitious Records, the first lady of motswako, rapper Fifi Cooper is headed to the Naija Music Showdown in Nigeria as part of the prestigious Pepsi Corporate Elite Weekend Takeover. Cooper will rub shoulders with some of Nigeria s biggest musicians at the all-Naija, all-night, no-table affair at the iconic Eko Hotel in Lagos. On the bill are the likes of Tekno, Flavour, Davido, Tiwa Savage, Phyno, Falz and Skales. US stars Sisqo, Blackstreet, Next and Jagged Edge will perform on the second night at the black tie event. Cooper will also take the opportunity to collaborate with Nigerian talent and record some music. This is major, Cooper gushed. This is my step into the lucrative and highly competitive Nigerian music scene. I m thrilled beyond words that I will be on stage and also meeting influential musicians who continue to set the bar across the continent. My dream has been to break into other markets and this is the beginning. Publicist Gastor Serumula of Israel Media said she feels Cooper was ready to go global. Fifi knows that the stage is big and has potential to launch her not only in Nigeria. She is a hard worker and I know she will rise up to the occasion, she said.
