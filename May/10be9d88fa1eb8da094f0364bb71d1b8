Springbok stalwart Bryan Habana and Irish hooker Richardt Strauss have highlighted an area of concern for South African rugby stars playing abroad; it is not just the favourable exchange rate that is making local rugby players leave in droves, citing crime as a major factor in the exodus. Habana, the Bok record tryscorer with 65 and a veteran of 124 Tests in the Green and Gold and now with French giants Toulon, said: A lot people think rugby players go overseas to gain money, to gain a residency in another country. But there are so many different factors which people take into consideration. Strauss represented South Africa at Under-19 level before throwing in his lot with Leinster and has worn the Irish jersey 17 times since 2012. He was more forthright. I m so scared of going back and waiting for something to happen, he told The Times in London. If a violent crime happens it s too late, isn t it? It s too late to make a decision then. My family have been lucky. Which individuals with exportable skills, we would ask, would not leave a country with one of the highest murder rates in the world? We would suggest very few.
