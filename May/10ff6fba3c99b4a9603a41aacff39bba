Police officers from the Selosesha crime intelligence unit and the Selosesha K9 unit have arrested a man for driving a vehicle with a fake vehicle disc in Botshabelo and a woman for allegedly producing the disc, Free State police said on Sunday. Police received a call from a traffic officer about a blue Mazda 323 driving about with an invalid vehicle disc, Sergeant Martin Xuma said. Officers from the two units responded immediately because they had been following up on earlier information about people producing fraudulent vehicle discs. Upon arrival a 56-year-old male who was driving the said vehicle was apprehended for driving a vehicle with a fraudulent vehicle disc. Further investigation led the police to an internet caf in Reahola complex in Botshabelo. Police found the 51-year-old female who owns the internet caf and on searching the premises a scanner and computer believed to have been used to produce fraudulent vehicle discs was found. The owner was apprehended for fraud as it emerged that she was allegedly producing fraudulent vehicle discs and selling them to motorists. The two arrested suspects were expected to appear in the Botshabelo Magistrate s Court soon, Xuma said. Selosesha policing cluster commander Brigadier Khothatso Ramokotjo applauded the two units for fighting crime and warned motorists to stop driving vehicles with invalid discs.
