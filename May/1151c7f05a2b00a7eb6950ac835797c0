South Africa&#8217;s representation at this year&#8217;s Indian Premier League (IPL) is officially over. Cricket South Africa (CSA) had given its contracted Proteas permission to play in the tournament until last Sunday and have rigidly stuck to that agreement.

But just how well did those eight men do? AB de Villiers (Royal Challengers Bangalore) The Proteas one-day skipper had a strange time in the IPL for Bangalore. He twice had to sit out with a back injury, famously called his wife for a pep talk en didn&#8217;t score a lot of runs. De Villiers ended with 216 runs at a strike rate of 132 but that haul included one innings of 89. In fact, his last six innings only delivered 79 runs. Chris Morris (Delhi Daredevils) The lanky 30-year-old all-rounder lived up to his hefty price tag with an excellent campaign. He&#8217;s always enjoyed the T20 format and clearly flourished being a key player for Delhi. Morris snaffled 12 wickets, including a brilliant 4/26 in a game where the opposition scored 191. He also whacked 152 runs at a strike rate of 163. Kagiso Rabada (Delhi Daredevils) It took a while for the young superstar to get into Delhi&#8217;s final XI but he certainly made an impression. The 21-year-old gave a long overdue reminder of his batting ability with a fine 44 on debut. He adapted fairly well on the Indian pitches to grab six wickets. Hashim Amla (Kings XI Punjab) Rather unexpectedly, the bearded stalwart proved a rock star. Two 60-ball 104s and another two fifties meant Amla ended with 420 runs at an excellent strike rate of 145. Even more brilliantly, he did so without changing the way he normally plays. David Miller (Kings XI Punjab) There was virtually none of the big-hitting we&#8217;ve become used to seeing from the left-hander. He eventually only played five matches and never got the opportunity to build a decent platform. Miller only scored 83 runs. Imran Tahir (Rising Pune Supergiant) It&#8217;s crazy to think this man only got into this year&#8217;s tournament by virtue of being an injury replacement. The wily Proteas leg-spinner &#8211; the top ranked bowlers in ODIs and international T20s &#8211; was outstanding in scalping 18 victims. He kept his economy under eight and took a wicket every second over Tahir leaves a huge void for Pune to fill. Faf du Plessis (Rising Pune Supergiant) South Africa&#8217;s Test captain had a working holiday. The form of England&#8217;s Ben Stokes and Aussie skipper Steve Smith meant there was hardly a place for him in the batting line-up. Du Plessis only played one game, making 8.
