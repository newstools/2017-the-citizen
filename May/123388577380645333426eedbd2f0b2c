Pearl Thusi is in the country on a production break from her New York based international series, Quantico. She celebrated her birthday with her fiance Robert Marawa and her daughter Thando alongside DJ Zinhle and friends. Thusi presented an award at the Samas, where she appeared in a floor length pink gown. While she isn&#8217;t exactly a fashionista of note, she tends to play it safe this time she really irked Twitter which gave her dress a thumbs down.
