The Johannesburg Zoo has welcomed a new arrival in the form of a young De Brazza s monkey. The youngster was born on 17 April and is adapting well to life within the troop. According to primates curator Katherine Stanton Visser, the gestation period of a De Brazza s monkey is five months, and the weening period will be similar. It is currently feeding well off the mother, and the troop have accepted it, she says. The mother has had a number of babies before, so is an old hand at parenting, adds Stanton Visser. The youngster has not been named yet, as the sex has not been identified. The De Brazza s enclosure can be seen on Monkey Lane at the zoo.
