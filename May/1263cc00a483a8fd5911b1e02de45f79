Earlier this week, Warren Whiteley became one of the most important role players in Springbok rugby. But his new captaincy responsibility won&#8217;t distract him from his Lions duties against the Kings at Ellis Park on Sunday. In fact, he&#8217;ll be very angry with himself if his focus is 100%. &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to let any of my teammates down with distracted thoughts this weekend,&#8221; said Whiteley on Friday. &#8220;I refuse to do so. You know what you&#8217;ve previously achieved with your teammates is what have given you other opportunities. First and foremost, I&#8217;m indebted to them.&#8221; Not that the 30-year-old eighthman will struggle putting the Lions first for one last time before the international break. &#8220;It&#8217;s a challenge but it becomes easy when you&#8217;re surrounded by your teammates and fans again,&#8221; said Whiteley. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got the right culture and set of values here. That makes it easier to move away from the Springbok camp and concentrate on the task at hand.&#8221; To be honest, the Lions are currently the rock stars of South African rugby and boast nine of their players in the Springbok squad. It&#8217;s only human for some of them &#8211; particularly new inclusions Ruan Dreyer, Courtnall Skosan and Andries Coetzee &#8211; to feel rather excited. But coach Johan Ackermann made sure that issue was addressed early in the week. &#8220;One of our first discussions when the guys returned was what our expectations are for the week,&#8221; he said. &#8221; I told the guys if you&#8217;re mind is already thinking of the coming weeks, you&#8217;re lining yourself up for a blow. I trust them, they&#8217;re professional and know what&#8217;s expected of them. &#8220;That doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;m not excited for their part. They&#8217;ve shown tenacity and worked really hard. It&#8217;s great to see them becoming quality players.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
