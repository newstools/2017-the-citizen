Musgrave Centre in KwaZulu-Natal was the target of yet another brazen robbery when a gang of robbers stormed in the mall. According to Blue Security spokesperson Andreas Mathios, a gang of 14 armed suspects carried out a well-orchestrated armed robbery at about 10.50pm on Sunday when some restaurants were still open, Berea Mail reported. Mathios said the gang had arrived in a VW Golf 5 (ND 238687) and a white Lexus (ND 205883). The men, wearing balaclavas and carrying rifles and other firearms stormed into the mall while their accomplices waited outside in Stephen Clamini (Essenwood) Road, communication on two-way radios throughout the robbery. The gang forced open the front door of the Telkom store inside the centre and fled with electronic goods. The whole robbery was over in minutes. Police and Metro Police attended the scene of the crime. Musgrave Centre has been the target of a number of robberies in recent months. Shop owners and staff have been urged to be on high alert following a spate of burglaries in shopping malls in recent weeks, where brazen criminals have smashed their way through the front doors of several stores. &#8211; Caxton News Service For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter .
