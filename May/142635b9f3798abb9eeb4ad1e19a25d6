Following media reports that PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) handed a damning report to the Eskom board regarding Gupta-linked company Tegeta&#8217;s contract to supply coal to the power utility, parliament&#8217;s standing committee on public accounts (Scopa) has resolved to summon the board and management. Scopa has announced today that Eskom has been summoned to appear before it in two weeks time to discuss the PwC report. &#8220;Elements in that report are of great concern to the committee, such as how Eskom s contract with Tegeta was structured and managed,&#8221; said Faith Kwaza of parliamentary communications unit. She said in a statement Scopa was concerned that the constitutional provision of fair, competitive and transparent procurement was not followed. &#8220;The committee will also write to the department of water and sanitation to find out how Tegeta s water-use licence was handled,&#8221; she added.
