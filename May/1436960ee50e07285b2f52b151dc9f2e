Preliminary investigation suggests that the robbers, reportedly driving in a silver Toyota Corolla, confronted staff members who were at the time in the parking lot on Tuesday. Boksburg police spokesperson Sergeant Cebisa Maseko said the suspects threatened the workers at gunpoint before dragging them into the Clicks store in Parkrand, Boksburg, on the East Rand. The staff members were forced to lie on the ground while robbers were loading expensive items in baskets and shopping bags, Boksburg Advertiser reported. Maseko said the thieves randomly opened fire, sparking mass panic, before jumping into their getaway vehicle and sped off with an estimated R75 000 worth of goods. No injuries were reported. A case of business robbery is being investigated. No arrests have been made so far. &#8211; Caxton News Service &nbsp;
