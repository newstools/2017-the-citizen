South African rider Ryan Gibbons grabbed eighth spot on Friday, making a stunning debut in his first Grand Tour race by delivering a brave performance on the opening stage of the Giro d&#8217;Italia. Gibbons held on for a late sprint on the 206km leg between Alghero and Olbia, and though Lukas Postlberger of Austria (Bora-Hansgrohe) took the stage win, Gibbons managed an impressive top-10 finish. It was one of the best performances of his career, building on a superb season for the 22-year-old Dimension Data rider after he won the Tour de Langkawi in Malaysia in March. He also settled in fourth place in the race for the young riders&#8217; jersey. Another Di-Data rider, Italian Kristian Sbaragli, finished sixth in the sprint, closing out a solid day for the local outfit. &#8220;We are looking forward to the next stages. The spirit in the team is really good,&#8221; Sbaragli said. &#8220;I am feeling good and you could see all our guys were strong today.&#8221; Saturday&#8217;s second stage of the three-week race will take the peloton 221km from Olbia to Tortoli.
