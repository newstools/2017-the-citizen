A source who went to the same high school as Sandile Mantsoe, the Sandton-based man who was Mokoena&#8217;s boyfriend and arrested for her murder, said he matriculated the same time as him in 2007. According to Ridge Way Times, the source revealed that Mantsoe was dedicated to studying and kept to himself most of the time. Mantsoe also grew up in eMbalenhle, Secunda, in Mpumalanga. Stephanie Long, Mokoena&#8217;s friend, told The Star that Mantsoe was deeply religious and would quote Bible verses verbatim. &#8220;He was a smooth talker and had his way around everything. He was always neat and put together,&#8221; Long said. Another woman who went to University of Johannesburg with Mantsoe said his religious beliefs influenced his studies so much that in graphic design class, he would refuse to draw a naked body. &#8220;Everything was based on religion with him; he would refuse to do certain things if he felt something was not righteous in the eyes of God.&#8221; Mokoena went missing about two weeks ago. Her disappearance was covered extensively on social media with many people retweeting and sharing her images on Twitter and Facebook. Mokoena&#8217;s uncle, Tshepo, wrote on Facebook that Mantsoe had confessed to killing and burning her body. He was arrested on Thursday and appeared in court today. His next court appearance is scheduled for May 24. He has requested to be held at the Norwood Police Station. Mokoena&#8217;s family members told media that they had seen CCTV footage of Mantsoe taking linen out of his home the day of her murder. Her uncle said he doused her with petrol and put a tyre around her neck and set her alight. Her body was burnt beyond recognition.
