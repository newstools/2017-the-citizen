The man accused of murdering Karabo Mokoena and burning her body appeared in court today. His case was postponed to May 24, where he is expected to apply for bail. According to Times LIVE, Mokoena&#8217;s family was present at the court appearance. They were emotional and broke down in tears as he appeared. One woman shouted that Mantsoe would &#8220;burn in hell&#8221; for his alleged actions. Mantsoe also had no objection to having his picture taken by the media, as his images were already circulating on social media. Mokoena went missing for weeks, and her friend, Stephanie Long, took to social media to alert people to her disappearance. Her images were circulated on social networks for days and tweeted by celebrities such as Cassper Nyovest, and even politicians took up the cause. Mokoena&#8217;s father wrote on Facebook a day ago that her boyfriend had confessed to the murder, though police would not confirm this. Mantsoe is also understood to have shown police where her body was, with Mokoena&#8217;s family stating they had seen CCTV footage of him dragging out linen on the day he is believed to have murdered her. Mantsoe has requested to remain at Norwood Police Station.
