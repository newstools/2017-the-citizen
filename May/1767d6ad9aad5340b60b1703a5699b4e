 It is believed that the collision took place after the driver of a Nissan bakkie lost control of his vehicle and collided with a Ford Ranger, ER24 spokeswoman Annine Siddall said. Unfortunately nothing could be done for the driver of the Nissan and he was declared dead on the scene. One person in the Ford Ranger sustained serious head injuries and another sustained back injuries. The patients were transported to Mediclinic Potchefstroom and Potchefstroom hospital. The driver of the Ford Ranger and one other passenger were not injured, Siddall said. For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
