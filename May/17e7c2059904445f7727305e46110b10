Alarm bells can go off after Thusi was spotted wearing her engagement ring. She conveniently posted a snap on Instagram of herself flaunting the ring while in New York where she films for US series Quantico. Thusi and Marawa set tongues wagging after they were involved in a mini Twitter war last week. According to youth website Connect, the sports anchor tweeted something along the lines of unfinished business [which results in] nagging, unresolved, unexpressed/withheld feelings, memories and events of hurt, anger and resentment towards another person that would ultimately put someone through the most. Thusi clapped back when she saw the tweet and responded with a lol and added: You subtweeted me but you have my number . The tweet included a But why? meme, a confused emoji and the hashtags #thisisalsoasubtweet and #atweetforatweet. Marawa then blocked his fianc e on Twitter adding fuel to speculation there was trouble in paradise. The pair got engaged last year and are set to walk down the aisle soon though they are yet to confirm a date. Their engagement has been plagued with rumours after a tabloid reported Thusi was wearing an engagement ring despite Marawa having not paid lobola for her. Some African cultures dictate that a bride-to-be may not wear an engagement ring until the family has met to discuss lobola and an amount is agreed upon and paid. #nailedit A post shared by Pearl Thusi (@pearlthusi) on May 8, 2017 at 5:34am PDT READ MORE: How karma caught up with Cassper, left him broken-hearted For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
