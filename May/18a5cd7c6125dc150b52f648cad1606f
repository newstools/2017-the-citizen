Wayne Parnell: Proteas opener. South Africa&#8217;s first warm-up match of their tour to England revealed this intriguing possibility after the all-rounder coped well at the top of the order. The 27-year-old was asked to be Quinton de Kock&#8217;s partner in Friday evening&#8217;s game against Sussex and hit a superb 61 off just 42 balls as South Africa won by 66 runs.

He proved the perfect foil for the rampant De Kock, who whacked 104 off 78 deliveries. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think people should read too much in me opening the batting,&#8221; said Parnell afterwards. &#8220;I was going to fulfill that role whether it was 50 or 32 overs. Because we wanted to give Hashim Amla a bit of a break from batting, there was a spot open and I was the guy that was chosen to do the job. It was just nice to contribute wherever possible.&#8221; JP Duminy also shook off some of his rust with 68 off 46. He captained the side after AB de Villiers had to be withdrawn due to a respiratory infection. De Villiers will be monitored over the next few days. The Proteas bowlers got a good workout as well, Kagiso Rabada (2/26) struck twice in three overs, while Andile Phehlukwayo adapted well to take 2/46. &#8220;It was just about getting a few guys on the park for some competitive action,&#8221; said Parnell. &#8220;Some of the guys are on their first tour of England, so it&#8217;s just really important to get used to it. A few of us also didn&#8217;t play cricket since the tour of New Zealand.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
