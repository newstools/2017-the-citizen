It was apparent that the Proteas were comprehensively beaten in every department during the first one-day international against England at a sun-drenched Headingley in Leeds. It was not what you would have expected from a team rated the world s top-rated combination in this form of cricket. The bowling looked pedestrian, the fielding largely lacklustre and the batting fizzled and then failed, 72 runs short of the 339/6 posted by England. All this in 45 overs in which the hosts never looked like losing. The dithering over the future of Proteas coach Russell Domingo must be seen as a contributing factor. South Africa take on England again in the second game of the three-match series at the Rose Bowl in Southampton tomorrow. Another loss will surely dent our chances in the Champions Trophy which follows almost immediately, the Proteas taking on Sri Lanka at the Oval on June 3. South Africa s recent sporting past has been studded with similar disappointments; the Springboks ending last season with eight depressing losses in 12 Tests under coach Allister Coetzee. And Amajita, our under-20 World Cup side, effectively abandoned any aspirations of making headway with successive defeats by Japan and Italy. We sorely need a Protea victory to lift the gloom.
