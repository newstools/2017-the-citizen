Bryan Habana believes it&#8217;s not just a favourable exchange rate that is making local rugby players leave overseas in droves. Instead, the Springbok legend &#8211; currently playing for French giants Toulon &#8211; points to South Africa&#8217;s political uncertainty as a major factor.

A player will now need to wait five years. However, Habana says that won&#8217;t stop the bleeding. &#8220;I think a lot of people outside South Africa don&#8217;t understand that there are a number of unique things happening in South Africa at the moment,&#8221; he was quoted as saying by AAP. &#8220;Not only from a rugby point of view, but from a political, economic and safety point of view. A lot people think rugby players go overseas to gain money, to gain a residency in another country. But there are so many different factors which people take into consideration.&#8221; The Bok winger, who has scored a record 65 Test tries, is the second South African player to cite crime as a major factor in the exodus. Richardt Strauss, cousin of former national captain Adriaan, recently slammed South Africa&#8217;s &#8220;dangerous&#8221; environment. &#8220;I m so scared of going back and waiting for something to happen,&#8221; he told The Times in London. &#8220;If a violent crime happens it s too late, isn t it? It s too late to make a decision then. My family have been lucky.&#8221; Strauss qualified for Ireland in late 2015 and plans to stay an Irish resident. Habana, however, is far more diplomatic. He fully supports the South African Rugby Union&#8217;s (Saru) transformation drive. Yet he&#8217;s also realistic about how other perceive the process. &#8220;A lot of youngsters might move given the transformation charter which has been put down from a political point of view,&#8221; said Habana. &#8220;It&#8217;s such an intricate thing that if you don&#8217;t come from South Africa then you&#8217;ll never understand it. When these youngsters move, it&#8217;s not just about leaving South African shores, it&#8217;s about taking your future into consideration.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
