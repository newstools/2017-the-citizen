Cristiano Ronaldo&#8217;s sensational goalscoring record was hailed as &#8220;unique&#8221; by boss Zinedine Zidane as his latest hat-trick left Real Madrid on the verge of another Champions League final by thrashing Atletico Madrid 3-0. Ronaldo&#8217;s treble was his second against Atletico this season and second straight in the Champions League after hitting three past Bayern Munich in the quarter-finals. &#8220;Goalscoring is something he has over others, that is what makes him unique,&#8221; said Zidane. Victory extended Real&#8217;s hex over Atletico in the Champions League over the past four seasons. Real have eliminated Diego Simeone&#8217;s men in each of the past three years, including in the 2014 and 2016 finals, by the finest of margins. However, there was a gulf between the sides this time round as Ronaldo&#8217;s 10th minute header opened the scoring. And they struck twice more in the final 20 minutes to give the scoreline the reflection Real&#8217;s dominance deserved. &#8220;The team was tremendous. I scored the goals but the team was phenomenal from start to finish,&#8221; said Ronaldo. Victory also kept Real on course to become the first side to retain the Champions League in 27 years. &#8220;We played great, it is not easy to score three goals (against Atletico),&#8221; added Zidane. &#8220;The first half hour was fantastic, we had a lot of chances to score the second, but we got it in the second-half. &#8220;We are very happy with the performance. To score three goals and most importantly in a (two-legged) tie keep a clean sheet at home is very important.&#8221; Ronaldo is now just one goal behind Barcelona rival Lionel Messi as the Champions League&#8217;s top scorer this season with 10. Seven of those have come in his last three games, though, as he struck five of Madrid&#8217;s six in seeing off Bayern 6-3 on aggregate in the quarters. &#8220;It s great to have a player like him,&#8221; said Real midfielder Toni Kroos. &#8220;You can play good in defence, control midfield but in the end you need a player who will score and he did. &#8220;He always does. He scored five in the quarter-final and three today, so it s incredible for us.&#8221; There were contrasting emotions for Atletico boss Simeone. However, he refused to give up hope of a miraculous comeback on what will be the final European match at Atletico&#8217;s Vicente Calderon next Wednesday (May 10) before they move to a new stadium next season. &#8220;More than ever I am calm,&#8221; said Simeone. &#8220;We have to do something impossible and being Atletico Madrid we might be capable of it.&#8221; Barcelona pulled off the biggest comeback in Champions League history earlier this season by overcoming a 4-0 first leg deficit against Paris Saint-Germain. And Simeone is clinging to the hope of something similarly unexpected. &#8220;We need to forget about this game. &#8220;It seems impossible, but it is football and football has these unexpected things that make it marvellous. &#8220;Until the last drip of hope is gone, we will give it everything we have.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
