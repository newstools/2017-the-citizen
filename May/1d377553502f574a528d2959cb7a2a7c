Sunday&#8217;s ninth stage of the Giro d&#8217;Italia cycle race was marred by a mass crash involving a police motorbike. The crash virtually ended the overall title hopes of Sky teammates Geraint Thomas and Mikel Landa, plus Orica-Scott s Adam Yates. With 15 kilometers to go just before the climb riders in the main pack made contact with the motorcycle stopped alongside the road, prompting the crash that involved the trio and about a dozen other riders. All three of the overall contenders got back on their bikes but Landa appeared to be in severe pain, Yates had his knee bloodied and Thomas jersey and shorts were shredded.
