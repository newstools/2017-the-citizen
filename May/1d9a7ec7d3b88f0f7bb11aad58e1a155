Outspoken poet Ntsiki Mazwai has again been churning out the tweets on Monday, starting the discussion around marriage and love, but then segueing into politics in the early afternoon. With the news agenda dominated by another motion of no confidence from within the ANC against President Jacob Zuma amid new revelations about how his friends, the Guptas, allegedly &#8220;run the country&#8221;, Mazwai told her followers she would &#8220;break down&#8221; what had happened with the president. She said that white business interests had underestimated the threat Zuma represented to their aims. &#8220;White people who run sa [thought] Zuma was some stupid dude who just sang and danced and wouldn&#8217;t threaten their economy&#8230;&#8221; White people who run sa though Zuma was some stupid dude who just sang and danced and wouldn&#39;t threaten their economy&#8230; &mdash; Master Ntsiki (@ntsikimazwai) May 29, 2017 She further alleged that Zuma&#8217;s &#8220;alliance&#8221; with the Guptas &#8220;threatened&#8221; to &#8220;take&#8221; the economy that belongs to white people. Mazwai added that, in her view, the next president would be someone who wouldn&#8217;t threaten this &#8220;white monopoly capital&#8221;. Twitter user Wessel van Rensburg asked her if she&#8217;d prefer all South African capital to be in Dubai instead, in reference to media reports that Zuma allegedly plans to relocate to the UAE to &#8220;escape&#8221; his mounting problems in his home country. The president has rubbished this allegation, saying his only home will always be Nkandla. Mazwai responded to this tweet with emojis suggesting she found it boring and it was putting her to sleep. https://t.co/zQlnEaAnnG &mdash; Master Ntsiki (@ntsikimazwai) May 29, 2017 Mazwai retweeted a follower who also challenged the &#8220;narrative&#8221; that Zuma should be given all the blame for South Africa living through the &#8220;widest inequality gap &amp; record unemployment&#8221;. @khayalamagcina @ntsikimazwai We are living through the widest inequality gap &amp; record unemployment &amp; the narrative is &#39;uZuma udlalile ngabo.&#39; Seriously?! &mdash; Kgoatlapa, M.M. (@molisem) May 29, 2017 Mazwai retweeted the same user when he told her, in answer to her question on whether people thought Zuma had the kind of wealth rich white people had, that &#8220;Zuma is narrow-minded. I do not think that he has. I do know that he enables their [the Guptas&#8217;] unabated acquisition of wealth. I have a [problem] with that.&#8221; Ending with laughter emojis, Mazwai wrote that the &#8220;ANC was meant to protect white people capital not call their Indian friends&#8221;.
