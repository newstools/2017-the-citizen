When a team like the Lions has such a clear view on the type of rugby they play, people tend to think things eventually run on auto pilot. And you can&#8217;t blame them &#8211; when Johan Ackermann&#8217;s troops dispose of opponents as easily as they did the Rebels last week, it all seems so easy. But the Lions don&#8217;t do complacency. Also read: The Lions and Sharks have bite in our Super Rugby XV of the week They might be one of the best sides in the tournament but they are still willing to work on basic things. A case in point is the line-outs. Last year&#8217;s runners-up weren&#8217;t bad in that set-piece in 2016 though they did have their problems at times. 12 month&#8217;s later, it&#8217;s functioning like a thing of beauty. &#8220;There were a few times last year when things got sticky in the line-outs but in general we were accurate,&#8221; said Ackermann on Tuesday ahead of a meeting with the Brumbies in Canberra on Friday. &#8220;This year though things are going really smoothly. We&#8217;re grateful for that. There are teams that are going to specifically target you in the line-outs and we&#8217;ve had to prepare for that as well.&#8221; Despite tweaks to the system, the key to the Lions&#8217; improvements are down to the attitude of certain role players. &#8220;We&#8217;ve become more experienced. That makes a huge difference,&#8221; said Ackermann, himself a former Springbok lock. &#8220;A guy like Franco Mostert has really taken the lead. He&#8217;s the organiser and invests a lot of time and energy in improving in that regard.&#8221; Bulldozing hooker Malcolm Marx has also become close to a complete hooker this season by concentrating on improving his basic skills. &#8220;It&#8217;s been a real team effort. The hookers have been spending extra time just throwing line-out balls. It&#8217;s also important for the others to adapt their movements,&#8221; said the Lions mentor. The extra dedication means the Lions now can also count on the line-outs &#8211; the scrum has always been powerful &#8211; as a source of good possession for a dangerous backline. &#8220;(Backline coach) Swys de Bruin and the backs are very happy about that,&#8221; said Ackermann. &#8220;Possession is scarce in this game. You&#8217;re only really guaranteed of 50% of the ball in most games. It&#8217;s therefore important to make sure you use it well when you do have a scrum or line-out.&#8221; It&#8217;s a lesson the Lions have clearly taken to heart.
