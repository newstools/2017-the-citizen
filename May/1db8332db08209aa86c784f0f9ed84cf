Samsung SA held its #UnboxYourPhone S8 launch at Menlyn Mall, Pretoria, on Thursday night, and celebrities went in their numbers. Among them was Maps Maponyane, who was the MC, Somizi Mhlongo, Nasty C and DJ Euphonik. Part of the event required that Maps pour wine on a phone to prove that it was waterproof, but Somizi could not stand by and watch his friend waste a bottle of wine. Before Maps could even open the bottle, Somizi runs to the stage and tries to take the bottle from Maps, who in turn try to take it back from his friend. In the video shared by Samsung SA, Somizi can be seen lying on the floor as an attempt to get Maps to rather pour the wine into his mouth.
