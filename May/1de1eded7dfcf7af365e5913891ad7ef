Two people were seriously injured when the car they were travelling in left the road and rolled on the N2 southbound near the NPC cement factory in Durban on Saturday, paramedics said. Rescue Care paramedics were called to the scene just after 10am to find that the car had been travelling southbound when it rolled across onto the northbound carriageway, Rescue Care spokesman Garrith Jamieson said. Paramedics found that two occupants of the vehicle had sustained serious injuries and both needed advanced life support intervention. Once stabilised on the scene both men were transported to nearby hospitals for the further care that they required. At this stage the reason why the driver lost control of the car causing it to veer across the freeway was unknown, Jamieson said.
