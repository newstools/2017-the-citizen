&#8220;It only happens once in a while.&#8221; Kagiso Rabada was perhaps being a bit modest about him and Wayne Parnell&#8217;s destruction of the England top order in Monday&#8217;s seven-wicket win at Lord&#8217;s. The Proteas&#8217; opening bowling pair reduced the home side to 20/6 after just five overs. ============================================================= HOW RABADA AND PARNELL DESTROYED ENGLAND Over 0.5: Rabada keeps a ball teasingly outside off and opener Jason Roy takes the bait. It just moves away slightly and Hashim Amla has safe hands at slip. Over 1.5: Beautiful delivery from Parnell. Full ball just outside off before it swings in late and traps Joe Root plumb in front. Over 3.6: Parnell keeps it outside off to the left-handed Eoin Morgan, who&#8217;s deceived by a good length and a subtle hint of movement away. Over 4.1: Frankly, the poorest delivery of Rabada&#8217;s wickets as Alex Hales tries to square drive a half-volley, only to edge to slip. Over 4.5: Rabada exploits the attacking attitude of England&#8217;s batters by tempting Jos Buttler to hit through the covers. He also gets a thick edge to slip. Over 4.6: Good length and a tempting line by Rabada as Adil Rashid also tries to drive and edges. ====================================================================== It was the first time in the history of ODI cricket that a team lost six wickets in such a short period of time. &#8220;Yeah, it really doesn&#8217;t happen very often that the batters nick off like that,&#8221; said Rabada, who was superb in taking 4/39. &#8220;I definitely didn&#8217;t expect that to happen.&#8221; South Africa&#8217;s 22-year-old champion quick and an accurate Parnell exploited the cloudy conditions superbly as they gained a lot of swing. But they were also helped by a spicy pitch, something that&#8217;s becoming increasingly rare early on in England&#8217;s cricket season. Unsurprisingly, Rabada labelled the surface &#8220;quite a good pitch&#8221; though you suspect he&#8217;s being obviously biased. &#8220;It felt like a Test match. The pitch was very green,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It was competitive. However, as the ball got older, the batsmen started playing more strokes. There was nice bounce and carry. The crucial thing was to strike early. It stayed a good wicket, England focused on good lines and our batters were also cautious.&#8221; What also had Rabada excited was the prospect of having more of these types of surfaces to bowl on later in the tour. He had a month&#8217;s stint with English county side Kent last year but admits that didn&#8217;t really prepare him for what he would experience in this match. &#8220;I got a taste but I can say this was my first real true experience,&#8221; said Rabada. &#8220;We played a few four-day games but those pitches were really flat. This was a fuller, perhaps truer, experience.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
