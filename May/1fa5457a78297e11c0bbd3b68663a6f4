Springbok coach Allister Coetzee probably receive somewhat of a reprieve from the rugby public by confirming Warren Whiteley as his new captain. The inspirational Lions skipper had been touted as one of the favourites for the role and will be a popular choice among fans. Whiteley was also assured of his place in the side because he&#8217;s been the most consistent local eighthman in the Super Rugby campaign. &#8220;Warren has been one of the outstanding leaders in South African rugby for many years,&#8221; said Coetzee. &#8220;He is respected by his team-mates and opposition alike and has a lot of experience when it comes to captaincy, having led the Lions with great authority for many seasons. He is resilient, copes well under pressure and makes good decisions.&#8221; Notable returnees from overseas are Duane Vermeulen &#8211; who&#8217;ll probably switch to blindside flank because of Whiteley&#8217;s role &#8211; as well as the mercurial Frans Steyn. New additions are Sharks centre Lukhanyo Am, Lions fullback Andries Coetzee and his halfback teammate Ross Cronje, Stormers utility back Dillyn Leyds, Cheetahs wing Raymond Rhule, Lions wing Courtnall Skosan, Lions prop Ruan Dreyer and Bulls counterpart Lizo Gqoboka.
