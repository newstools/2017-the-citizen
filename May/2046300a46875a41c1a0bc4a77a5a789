About 300 Transnet trainees embarked on a peaceful march to the Union Buildings yesterday to submit their memorandum of demands and ask the office of the presidency to intervene and help them find jobs within Transnet. The trainees demanded that they should be given work exposure of about three years after completing their training, because no company would hire them without experience. They train us and after that, what happens? They train us and then we go sit at home, said Bukhosibokhe Ngcongo, Koedoespoort Depot deputy representative of the apprentices. Sylvester Nkuna, the apprentices representative, said they had several engagements with the management of Transnet Engineering and also the management of public enterprises, but those engagements never yielded satisfactory results. They wrote two memorandums over the past two years and the department wrote letters proposing meetings, which never took place, he said. There was a plan to create jobs that they have presented to the department of public enterprises and they would get jobs if that plan was executed, Nkuna said. The trainees gave the office of the presidency three weeks to respond to their demands. Transnet apprentices said if their memorandum of demands goes unanswered for three weeks, they would lock down the Koedoespoort Depot.
