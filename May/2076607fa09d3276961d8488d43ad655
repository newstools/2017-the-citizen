Former New Zealand Race Relations Commissioner Gregory Fortuin reckons it&#8217;s time Zuma puts the country first. Sowetan LIVE reports that Fortuin, who served as honorary council in New Zealand from 1998 to 2009, said the country need courageous leadership, for leadership is in the interest of all South Africans. This is not a storm that we can ride out by default. The highest office of our land continues to fail its people there can be no impunity. Zuma must go Fortuin said on Sunday, 30 May. The devaluation of the rand the hammering on the stock market and the fright of investors are real. The downgrading of our long-term foreign currency credit by S&amp; P and others to sub-investment grade with a continuing negative outlook is disastrous. He said that South African representatives living abroad are continually challenged and questioned at every opportunity about what has been happening recently in the country. He also spoke of the disastrous sackings of former finance ministers Nhlanhla Nene and Pravin Gordan, as well deputy minister Mcebiso Jonas. In the past, we have staunchly defended the dream of a better life for all but President Zuma is making it impossible. We are embarrassed and have no defence!
