Michael Azzie-trained dual Grade 1 winner, Hat Pun tano (ARG), is an interesting supple mentary entry for the 2017 Voda com Durban July bringing to 47 the number of horses still in con tention for the big race on 1 July 2017. The first VDJ Log has been is sued by Gold Circle and serves as a clear indication as to who would be in the field if the race was run tomorrow. We have not considered Hat Puntano at this stage as he has yet to win beyond 1600m and has not been seen in action since July 2016, said Gold Circle Racing Ex ecutive Raf Sheik. Hopefully he will make his South African debut in the near future, he added. The top six spots on the VDJ Log are occupied by horses who have won automatic qualifying races this season. Marinaresco and Captain America, at 7 and 8, lead the way among the balance but there is a long way to go yet and those on the outside looking in still have plenty of opportunities to qualify. Second declarations close at 11am on Monday, 29 May and final supplementary entries close at 11am on Monday, 12 June. The weights will be published on Tuesday, 13 June and final declarations close on Monday, 19 June. The announcement of the final field and barrier draws will take place on Tuesday, 20 June. The public gallops will take place at Greyville Racecourse on Thursday, 22 June, starting at 7am.
