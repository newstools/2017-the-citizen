As the season comes to an end on the High veld, Kwazulu-Natal takes up the reins and all systems are go for another few months of quality racing. Sunday sees the raiders take on hometown heroes at Greyville as the curtain goes up on Cham pions Season where there is also a guaranteed Pick 6 Megapool of R2.7-million on offer. Three Grade 2 feature races take place and the Daisy Fillies Guineas over 1600m has attracted a solid field of 11 runners. It looks a competitive event where a few questions need to be asked before making any selections: Will Grey ville suit some of the higher rated horses; which fillies may need the run; and which could be ahead of the handicapper and be bet ter than rated? On paper Ektifaa, trained by Mike de Kock, must be the horse to beat being best in at the weights. She has run in some strong company and won in two provinc es. The main dangers will be Final Judgement who will improve on her comeback run, Sail, Gimme Six and A Womens Way who mas terly gets Piere Strydom in the irons. Philae from the Andre Nel yard, could be one of those who prove better than currently rated. The Daisy Guineas over 1600m, is next on the card where De Kock may come up trumps again with Janoobi being best in at the weights. Copper Force, Africa Ris ing, Horizon, Zodiac Ruler and Matador Man also have claims. Some powerful yards send out Vodacom Durban July hopefuls in this year s running of the In dependent On Saturday Drill Hall Stakes over 1400m. This is usu ally a good pipe-opener for those individuals starting their prepa rations for the big one in July. Last year s winner New Predator, will be back to defend his crown. Cap tain America and Sail South are the two well weighted runners in the race while other dangers in clude Marinaresco, Black Arthur, Champagne Haze and Bulleting Home. Ten Gun Salute and Saratoga Dancer hold the best hope for lo cal trainer Duncan Howells.
