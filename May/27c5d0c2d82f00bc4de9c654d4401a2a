Babes Wodumo and her boyfriend Mampintsha made news on Saturday night after posting videos of themselves bashing the South African Music Awards. The on-off couple accused artists and record labels of buying awards. Babes was nominated in several categories, including Best Newcomer and Record of the Year. She lost out to Amanda Black and Nasty C. Though she closed the ceremony, performing her hit track Wololo, she was upset and immediately recorded a video in which she questioned the judging process of the Samas. Although the pair have taken to YouTube to apologise for their outburst, Twitter didn&#8217;t waste any time poking fun at Mampintsha. We have put together some of the most hilarious videos from the #MampintshaChallenge. #MampintshaChallenge This is a serious matter #BabesChallenge pic.twitter.com/FxTjyJlM2L &mdash; soulistic_Virgo (@slindi_simelane) May 30, 2017 #MampintshaChallenge &#8211; *roll news jingle* In Breaking News &#8211; Nontobeko Sibisi &amp; @ZikhonaTshona take on Mampintsha Challenge pic.twitter.com/Ph1znJhUlh &mdash; Nontobeko Sibisi (@Nontobek0Sibisi) May 30, 2017 #MampintshaChallenge I&#39;M TIRED OF DOWNLOADING ARMY AND POLICE APPLICATION FORMS, THEY THROW THEM AWAY F-MAAN pic.twitter.com/lkFp8YpWZq &mdash; #ALLEYEZONME (@jimjayjuggalos) May 30, 2017 #MampintshaChallenge fok mahn #ProudlyPedi pic.twitter.com/SfMpgkNCHg &mdash; You&#39;ve been missed (@KholoMantloana) May 30, 2017 We have been wanting Dzaddy!
