The KwaZulu-Natal Department of Health announced on Tuesday, that it has contingency plans in place to mitigate the impact on the Port Shepstone Provincial Hospital after a fire broke out earlier in the week. The orthopaedic ward is closed, and patients are using alternative wards (G Ward and Ward 2). The paediatric ward has also been closed and patients have been moved to the paediatric outpatient ward. The casualty unit has been affected, and will only accept emergency patients for stabilisation before they are referred to neighbouring healthcare facilities, the department said in a statement. The department said elective operations have been put on hold until the theatres are cleared after a fire broke out on Monday. Out of five theatres, only one is operational. Hospital management is in discussions with neighbouring health facilities to assist with emergency operations, the department said. Eye clinic patients are requested to come to Outpatient Department for rescheduling of their appointments. The department said elective eye operations will be done at Murchison Hospital and patients will be transported to the healthcare facility. Some patients files were damaged, patients relatives are requested to contact the hospital to confirm which hospitals patients have been transferred to. The department said after the fire scare at the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Hospital in Durban on Monday, the hospital was now operating normally. No casualties in the form of death or injury were reported in both incidents. The causes of both fires are still unknown, and will be determined by investigations by the relevant authorities.
