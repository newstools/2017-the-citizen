 Hamba Guptas hamba! (Leave Guptas leave) said Joe Mpisa, at the Chris Hani Commemoration event in the Boksburg City Hall. The party took this initiative to celebrate our own Chris Hani day because we don t want this confusion that it becomes a government event and not an SACP event said Mpisi. According to Sowetan LIVE, During his speech at the event, he mentioned that, as of this year, the party will celebrate the legacy of Chris Hani annually and separately from the state-organised commemoration. He went on to say that the Central Committee feels that President Jacob Zuma should step down with immediate effect. Comrade Chris Hani never had his Guptas he was an independent focused and incorruptible leader he said. He also mentioned that the SACP had taken note of the large number of state intelligence officers who were monitoring the party s leadership at events such as the Kathrada Memorial. We have never seen such many them [intelligence officers] at our events. But to them I say, go back and tell them our party is strong. We are not confused the SACP is an independent party and we won t be told you can t say this and you can t say that Mpisi said.
