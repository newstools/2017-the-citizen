Two brothers from Eersterust, east of Pretoria, died in a freak accident on their way to Marydale in the Northern Cape to surprise their mother and grandmother with a visit to celebrate Mother s Day. Lamuel Adams (12) Pic: Supplied But it turned out to be the worst Mother s Day for their mom, Jennifer Adams, 43, and their grandmother, Lindiwe Jood, 67. Lamuel, 12, and Sammuel, seven, Adams were respectively in Grade 8 and Grade 3 in the Nantes Primary School in Eersterust. The brothers were singing and praising God until they were brought to a deadly halt when a large kudu bull jumped out of the bushes in front of the car they were in on the road to Prieska and managed to lift the vehicle up. Their father, Johnny Adams, said the kudu broke his neck in the process, but the vehicle veered off the road, drove over a small tree and then overturned on loose stones. My kids were flung out of the vehicle. Lamuel died at the scene. It was very, very difficult for me not to be able to do anything to save my son, Adams said. He said his daughters, V_Casey Lee Bosman, two, and Afeni Adams, 16, sustained minor injuries. All these years we have devoted our children to the Lord. Samuel Adams (7) Pic: Supplied We nicknamed the one pastor and the other one church leader. We had so many plans for our children but if God decided that their time and work on earth was done, we will find comfort in His decision, said a devastated Adams. He described how his sons would always ask him to take them to the Vaal and the Orange River. On our way on Thursday we stopped at the Vaal River and took pictures. We got into the car and sang and praised the Lord together. Our joy was so big and I have never sang with such soul and so hard with my sons, we gave so many hours to Jesus, he said.
