Fears that a Ho rskool Tuine learner had broken his neck in a rugby match on Thursday have proved to be unfounded. School principal JA Swanepoel told Rekord that the grade 9 boy was making good progress. His parents updated us on his condition, and the injury is not serious as we had initially feared. Paramedics thought he might have suffered a neck injury, however, recent scans indicate that he only suffered an injury to his shoulder, he said. Swanepoel said the boy was expected to be discharged from hospital soon. CrisisOnCall services said he was airlifted to hospital. The learner was in severe pain following a dangerous rugby tackle. He suffered what looked like spinal injuries and had to be airlifted to a private facility, they said. &#8211; Caxton News Service For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter . &nbsp;
