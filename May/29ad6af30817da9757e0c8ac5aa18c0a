Lehlogonolo Masoga&#8217;s self-congratulatory statement to the media earlier this month that he had been &#8220;cleared&#8221; of incurring an obscene cellphone bill for viewing pornographic material while on legislature business in the US in 2014 could not be any further from the truth. Speaking to The Citizen through her spokesperson, Oupa Segalwe, Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane revealed that the &#8220;closing report&#8221; handed to the acting secretary of Limpopo Legislature on May 15 was &#8220;unauthorised&#8221;. Masoga, the deputy speaker of the legislature, was accused of running an &#8220;X-rated tab&#8221; of R120 000. He denied the allegations and labelled them &#8220;a smear campaign&#8221; aimed at discrediting his name. At the time, the EFF demanded the matter be investigated urgently. The party also referred the matter to the legislature&#8217;s ethics committee. The DA pursued the matter through parliamentary questions in the provincial legislature. At the beginning of the week, Masoga sent the media a press statement, announcing that he received a &#8220;closing report&#8221; from the public protector Limpopo office. He claimed that the &#8220;closing report&#8221; exonerated him.

Accordingly, the public protector considers the investigation ongoing. Earlier this week, a legislature official, speaking on condition of anonymity, denied that Masoga was &#8220;cleared&#8221;. &#8220;Mr Masoga may have been cleared by the public protector. She may very well have said he did not spend R120 000 watching pornography. But the legislature has to debate this matter after a report is tabled. So far, no such report has been forwarded to the legislature or tabled at all,&#8221; the official said. It has now emerged that the report Masoga relied on to clear himself of wrongdoing is the subject of an inquiry. &#8220;It has come to the attention of the public protector that the investigation was irregularly and improperly closed. The public protector only saw the report in question for the first time today [Thursday May 27]. &#8220;The conduct of the provincial official(s) in irregularly and improperly closing the investigation is inconsistent with established standards as outlined in our internal Investigations Handbook,&#8221; said Segalwe. Segalwe further explained to The Citizen that &#8220;the handbook provides that only the public protector can close investigations that are classified as &#8216;Special Attention Matters&#8217; (SAM). It defines an SAM as an investigation involving a politician or head of institution or any investigation conducted in terms of the Executive Members Ethics Act.&#8221; Due to this status quo, Segalwe said: &#8220;Accordingly, the public protector considers the investigation ongoing. Disciplinary steps will be taken against the official(s) involved.&#8221; Though cautious not go into granular details, Segalwe also confirmed that the investigator may face charges of &#8220;irregularly and improperly closing an investigation because the investigator did not have the authority to do so&#8221;.
