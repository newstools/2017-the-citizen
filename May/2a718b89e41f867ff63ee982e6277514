Temba Bavuma doesn&#8217;t want to be pigeonholed and that&#8217;s one of the main reasons why he&#8217;s moving back to Cape Town. The Cape Cobras on Tuesday confirmed the 26-year-old Proteas batter had joined the franchise after ending a nine-year association with the Highveld Lions. A bonus for the Capetonians is the fact they won&#8217;t have to pay Bavuma a cent as he&#8217;s nationally contracted with Cricket South Africa (CSA). Also read: Proteas go into Champions Trophy as No 1 The diminutive cricketer is currently only considered a Test player, a perception he clearly wants to change as some critics still believe he is too short to have the power to score quick runs consistently. Yet Bavuma scored a magnificent 113 on his One-day International debut against Ireland last year. It&#8217;s an example that&#8217;s used to argue that he might be a far better limited overs players than people think. &#8220;I believe that Temba, when not on international duty, can enhance the Cape Cobras chances significantly of winning the domestic four-day and one-day titles,&#8221; said Nabeal Dien, the Cobras&#8217; chief executive. &#8220;His versatility off back and front foot and his good running between the wickets could make him a significant factor in the domestic 50-over campaign.&#8221; With former Proteas keeper Dane Vilas off to the Dolphins and opener Omphile Ramela expected to move to the Lions, Bavuma could be a shoo-in in the 50-over format. But there&#8217;s another ulterior motive for getting his signature. The Cobras are not known for producing many black African players and desperately need a beacon to encourage youngsters to rather take up cricket. Bavuma is perfect in that regard. He&#8217;s established a foundation focusing on his old neighbourhood, Langa, and had millions watching when he scored his only Test hundred against England at Newlands. &#8220;His presence will also be an inspirational factor in township cricket and in encouraging and motivating young players to choose cricket as their premier sporting code instead of soccer,&#8221; said Cobras president Beresford Williams.
