President Jacob Zuma may have been booed by Cosatu members at the May Day celebrations in Bloemfontein on Monday, but ANC general-secretary Gwede Mantashe insists the celebrations were still a success. In a video that has been circulating on social media, Mantashe is asked what his opinion was on incident that saw the president failing to address the crowd who did not want to listen to him as calls for him to step down dominated the day. He does not comment on that, but instead says in Johannesburg, where he was, the May Day celebrations were a success. &#8220;Any event in Johannesburg where I was, we spoke, all of us. It was a good May Day, the reception was good and the crowd was warm. In Johannesburg where I am, the May Day has been a success, warm, and the crowd was warm to all of us,&#8221; he said.
