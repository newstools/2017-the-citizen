It was World Hypertension Day (WHD) on Wednesday last week and people were reminded about why they should keep track of their blood pressure readings it s a constant reminder and is still valid till today.Themed, Know Your Numbers, the WHD was meant to raise awareness about the disease in an effort to avert serious health consequences emanating from the silent condition.If one s blood pressure readings are above 120/80 on the blood pressure machine, it is said that one has high blood pressure (also referred to as hypertension).According to World Health Organisation (WHO) figures, only around half of those who died due to hypertension, knew they had the condition before they breathed their last the rest didn t know.WHO also reports that the prevalence of hypertension, or high blood pressure, in the African region is the highest worldwide, affecting an estimated 46 per cent of adults.In Tanzania the prevalence of hypertension is 26 per cent, meaning that in every 100 people, 26 have the condition, data from the Ministry of Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly and Children show.Every year 10 million people around the world die needlessly because of high blood pressure, making it the planet s single biggest killer, says the International Society of Hypertension.The only true way a person can establish if they have high blood pressure or not is by having it checked by a competent medic.Taking blood pressure readings is a painless procedureIt s recommended that every adult should have their blood pressure readings taken at least annually if not more often.Hypertension doesn t usually cause symptoms but people with the condition may complain of headaches, blurred vision light- headedness and dizziness.Nowadays doctors are much more relaxed about the way they approach compared to the way it used to be handled in the past.Medics could treat it with haste. Currently, doctors prefer a relaxed and a much more patient-centred-approach.It is known that those people who have pre-existing conditions such as kidney disease, cardiovascular disease or stroke usually report to hospital with their own set of individual problems.These usually require being treated on an individual basis; therefore it s important that any medical or drug treatment is carefully tailored around them.
