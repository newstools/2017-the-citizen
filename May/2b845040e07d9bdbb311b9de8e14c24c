Liverpool gained a vital win over Watford on Monday night to pull clear of the Manchester sides in the race for third in the Premier League. That was down to the brilliance of midfielder Emre Can, who delivered a stunning bicycle kick. It truly ranks as one of the contenders for goal of the season. &#8220;I have never scored a goal like that &#8211; maybe when I was younger. That is the best goal I&#8217;ve ever scored,&#8221; Can told Sky Sports. &#8220;I saw the space and I ran behind and my first thought was that I wanted to head it, then I didn&#8217;t think too much.&#8221; The man who could claim the assist for that, Lucas Leiva, had actually embarrassed himself a few minutes earlier with one of the more ridiculous dives this season. The Brazilian midfielder had tried to fool referee Craig Pawson into believing that The Hornet&#8217;s Tom Cleverley fouled him inside the penalty area. Erm&#8230;. diving much? Yellow card to Lucas!! #WATLIV pic.twitter.com/FUYHPgiTXA &mdash; Polly Rodgers (@PollyMUFC) May 1, 2017 He was immediately booked for simulation. Liverpool eventually held on for their 1-0 victory.
