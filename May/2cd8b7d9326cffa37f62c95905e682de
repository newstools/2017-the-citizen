Not far from the hustle and bustle of the border town Namanga in Arusha region, is a wild yet tranquil neighbourhood that leaves lasting memories to visitors eager to explore and enjoy a memorable timeLongido one of the districts in Arusha region in the north of Tanzania has relatively not been in the tourist map until a couple of decades ago. Longido shares a border with Ngorongoro district, among others.Longido s real estates development has given the historic area a new face. The district headquarters blocks among other buildings are built near the main highway. It has now become a friendly stop over for visitors travelling to or from Kenya.Home to unique landscapes, mountain, natural forests, magnificent views, diverse flora and fauna, and an ancient, this natural and cultural splendour has another facet a thriving Maasai culture and a popular destination for cultural walks and birdwatching.Traditionally the Maasai people are pastoralist but in some areas they are changing to become agro-pastoralist communities to support their livelihood.Linking natural and cultural environment to ensure a more sustainable development, the local communities embraced cultural tourism to support their livelihood from tourists.Cultural tourismLongido cultural tourism coordinated by Ally Mwako is an enterprise that is a collaborative initiative of the local communities. It is an initiative meant to be a more balanced and harmonious development which also values the environment and the natural and cultural heritage.Ally says So this is how we link the triple bottom line of economics, conservation and development in Longido using cultural tourism and all the monies generated from tourism go to support the local communities. A multi-skilled team of ten dedicated community trained local guides take visitors to explore the varied cultural heritage and natural landscapes in the sprawling land.Longido s various activities range from selling of handicrafts, wild herbs, home stays and other tourism activities have increased incomes of local communities especially that of the women and youth.Conserving the environmentLocals, according to Ally, are consistently sensitised to conservation of the flora and biodiversity by extracting herbs and plants for medicine in sustainable harvesting techniques.Visible from the towns on the horizon is the imposing pyramid shaped mountain with its jutting rocks and pathy vegetation. The Longido Mountain stand as a landmark.Notable to any nature enthusiast who appreciates the beauty of the environment are the scattered acacia trees. And, it is not only the beauty of the wider area that attracts visitors, but also sporadic sightings of giraffes, ostriches, gazelles and a hundred plus bird species.Other than the birdlife, Ally says, there is also an opportunity for those who have time to spare to hike on Mount Longido through a dense natural forest, which takes a full day.Wild animals crossing the Namanga highway migrate to Ngaresero near Lake Natron and enter Ngorongoro from there.A visit to the Maasai bomas is tailored with a birdwatching experience. The sights of birdlife chirping from different trees and the singing crickets create a melodious rhythm, and erase all memories of the noisy city life.The most amazing view across the short drive from Longido provides Mount Meru and Mount Kilimanjaro views in a clear horizon.After the short tour in the town I joined a group of tourists to explore the wealth of culture in one of the Maasai bomas where a party was going on.Our guide, Saitoti Sembeu introduced us to the Mzee of the boma and we were allowed to witness the celebration. It was an age-set (Marika) celebration, one of the Maasai cultural values.Later to wind up the day, our walk took us to the popular wildlife corridor, which serves as a road for migrating animals from and into Arusha national park nearby and a beautiful landscape rich in flora and fauna.
