It is that time of the year again when our Muslim brothers and sisters in Tanzania and the rest of the world begin fasting during the Holy Month of Ramadhan.As they start a month long journey towards fulfilling one of the major pillars of Islam, at The Beat we take this opportunity to support them in honouring God s command.It is going to be a month of reflections as our brothers and sisters put themselves before the Almighty for a chance of deliverance.It is our hope that the Almighty Allah will strengthen them, in the hope that we shall use this month to get past our weaknesses and work towards shaping the future in ways that pleases our creator.As we head towards a rather quiet period in the entertainment industry, it is our pledge to keep the promise to entertain and educate in equal proportions.May the Almighty Allah protect and bless you abundantly.Ramadhan Kareem
