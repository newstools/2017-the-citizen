With South African rugby all obsessed about attacking rugby nowadays, it&#8217;s not cool currently for a backline player to be a bumper car. After all, if you&#8217;re one, you&#8217;re probably a boring and even limited player. Burger Odendaal doesn&#8217;t care. Also read: Bulls desperately hope Boom Prinsloo pulls a Lappies If anything, the Bulls inside centre believes crashing into defenders is essential. &#8220;In any team, the No 12 has a big role in getting his forwards on the front foot,&#8221; said Odendaal on Wednesday. &#8220;To be honest, running into opponents comes rather naturally for me. I played flyhalf at school, so I always took contact.&#8221; Judging by his performances in this year&#8217;s Super Rugby campaign, the 24-year-old from Krugersdorp is hardly a one-trick pony. Yes, he&#8217;s been bumping off defenders like the Lions&#8217; Rohan Janse van Rensburg but he&#8217;s also been pretty good at finding space. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been trying to keep a balance this season. It&#8217;s all good and well for sides to try and find space on the field but it&#8217;s not always possible. Some defences are really tight,&#8221; said Odendaal. &#8220;Sometimes you need to crash before you can find space. But it&#8217;s not always easy to decide when to do what. You only have a second or two. It&#8217;s important to be varied.&#8221; One of the features of the Bulls&#8217; iffy campaign has been coach Nollis Marais&#8217; strategy of rotating his centre combinations. Not surprising when you have Springboks Jesse Kriel and Jan Serfontein in your group. What people didn&#8217;t foresee is that those two would be the men rotated and not Odendaal. He&#8217;s been Marais&#8217; go-to guy this season. It&#8217;s an interesting dynamic because conventional wisdom would tell two things in this regard. Firstly, centre combinations need to gel over a period of time to be effective. And, of course, high-profile players like Serfontein and Kriel don&#8217;t like being rotated. Odendaal says that doesn&#8217;t apply in this case. &#8220;When I came to the Bulls, Jan, (the injured) Dries Swanepoel and I played in the same age group. It was always a difficult thing when teams had to be picked with us three present,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s made it easier for us to accept a rotation policy at senior level. What also helped is that we didn&#8217;t come into the system with a whole bunch of senior guys still playing. That&#8217;s when you start creeping into your shell. In our situation, we&#8217;re a group of young players and we have the freedom to go all out. We relish the competition.&#8221; At the moment, Odendaal is winning that competition at Loftus &#8230; and maybe even at Springbok level too.
