South Africa&#8217;s rand extended losses against the U.S. dollar early on Tuesday, hurt by lingering domestic political tensions and a stronger greenback. * At 0645 GMT, the rand traded at 13.0500 per dollar, 0.6 percent weaker from its New York close on Monday. * The currency started the week on the back foot after President Jacob Zuma survived another call from inside the ruling party for him to step down. * Zuma is facing mounting pressure from African National Congress members, opposition parties and civil society since he sacked respected finance minister Pravin Gordhan in March, triggering credit rating downgrades. * &#8220;Optimism built up over the weekend has faded and the rand still has 20-30 cents to go if all of last week s outperformance is to be reversed,&#8221; Rand Merchant Bank currency strategist John Cairns wrote in a note. * &#8220;Trade has been less volatile than expected, but the U.S. and UK public holidays probably held back bigger moves and so there could be some weekend-related follow-through volatility today,&#8221; he added. * Stocks were set to open flat at 0700 GMT, with the JSE securities exchange&#8217;s Top-40 futures index barely unchanged. * In fixed income, the yield for the benchmark government bond due in 2026 rose 4.5 basis points to 8.64 percent.
