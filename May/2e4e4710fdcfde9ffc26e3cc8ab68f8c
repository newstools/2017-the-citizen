Now those words by the new US president have been pulled together as a &#8220;collection of poetry&#8221; in Norway. Who knew? Trump the poet? &#8220;What Trump says is closer to poetry and fiction than to reality,&#8221; said the Norwegian man who created the collection, Chris Felt. &#8220;We&#8217;re appalled that his rhetoric which seems to have little thought or preparation behind it could have won an electoral campaign,&#8221; Felt told the newspaper Aftenposten. The book&#8217;s tongue-in-cheek title is &#8220;Make poetry great again&#8221; &#8212; a play on Trump&#8217;s campaign slogan &#8220;Make America great again&#8221;. The content is composed strictly from speeches, interviews and other statements that the 70-year-old has given over the years. Among the choice bits turned to poems in the book are words about his daughter that Trump said around 10 years ago. &#8220;I have said if Ivanka were not my daughter, perhaps I would be dating her&#8221; Felt said the words may be &#8220;terribly macho, pitiful and confusing but when the quotations have space around them I see other facets of him&#8221;. Reading Trump&#8217;s words as poetry Felt said he felt in them &#8220;more despair, more insecurity and perhaps an inferiority complex&#8221;. According to the publisher Kagge, the first print run was 2,000 copies &#8212; one of which has been sent to Trump. Now the question is whether his penchant for superlatives will make it a &#8220;bestseller&#8221;. Agence France-Presse For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
