AKA released the much-anticipated video for the Caiphus Song on Wednesday morning. In the video, actress Jessica Nkosi and Warren Masemola play the happy couple that is getting married. The love song speaks of his publicised relationship with radio and television personality Bonang Matheba as well as his relationship with baby mama, DJ Zinhle. A few hours after the debut of his new video, AKA tweeted that, for him, music is a spiritual thing. &#8220;Too many artists out here trying to make a &#8216;hit&#8217; instead of staying true to what it means to be an artist,&#8221; he tweeted. &#8220;I am more concerned with making great music than I am with what I am wearing or what I&#8217;m driving. THAT is how I make hits.&#8221; Music is a spiritual thing. Too many artists out here trying to make a &quot;hit&quot; instead of staying true to what it means to be an artist. &mdash; AKA (@akaworldwide) May 10, 2017 I&#39;m more concerned with making great music than I am with what I&#39;m wearing or what I&#39;m driving. THAT is how I make hits. &mdash; AKA (@akaworldwide) May 10, 2017 This comes after his rival, Cassper Nyovest, told a fan on Twitter just less than a week ago that he is rich as f*ck. It s two Bentleys, a new V Class and new sprinter, five Rolexes and I m rich as fuck [sic], he told the follower. It seems as though AKA s tweets were directed at Cassper, who is known for bragging about his possessions on social media and in his songs. The two rappers are constantly throwing jabs at one another. Just last week, AKA released a song featuring Anatii on the same day as Cassper s album release. AKA then claimed that he wasn t aware that Cassper was releasing his album. Meanwhile on Wednesday, AKA s girlfriend tweeted brilliant video . Brilliant video. #CaiphusSongVid &mdash; Bonang B* Matheba (@bonang_m) May 10, 2017 The Caiphus Song made it to the top 10 trending topics of the day on Twitter, fans are responding well to the release of the video: #CaiphusSongVid damn this is too dope pic.twitter.com/TKIHahK0AZ &mdash; Lesego (@Thee_Les_ego) May 10, 2017 #CaiphusSongVid &quot;Don&#39;t Call Me A Dolly, Call Me An Uber.
