Mabopane police in Pretoria are searching for three men who fired on patrolling officers and hijacked a car in the early hours of Saturday morning. Gauteng police spokesperson Colonel Lungelo Dlamini said members of Tshwane North Cluster Reaction Team were patrolling around Sector 4 when they spotted a suspicious grey BMW with three occupants. Dlamini said when the officers tried to stop the car, the perpetrators fired on them and a shoot-out ensued, Rekord Centurion reported. He said the culprits abandoned the vehicle at Unit U in Mabopane and escaped on foot. Dlamini said the men then hijacked a Ford Fiesta, which was later recovered at Unit U not far from where it had been stolen. The suspects are unknown and the investigation continues, said Dlamini. He said no one was injured. Police are still trying to establish the ownership of the BMW and whether it was stolen. Armed men abandon vehicle after shootout with police.
