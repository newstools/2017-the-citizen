All hell broke loose on Freedom Day on Tsamaya Road in Mamelodi, Tshwane, after a wife caught her husband driving her car with his girlfriend. The woman, who eyewitnesses said appeared out of nowhere, can be seen on top of the bonnet of the car shouting for the nyatsi to get out of the car as her husband drives off in a video that has been circulating on social media. The car finally stops, and people gather around to understand what is going on. Someone can be heard saying the nyatsi must get out of the car and get a beating for being a homewrecker.
