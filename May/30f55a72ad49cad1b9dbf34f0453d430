The Springboks can still pick Bryan Habana should the need arise &#8230; instead of attending his funeral! The 33-year-old took to Twitter on Thursday night to assure fans he had not been killed in Paris. According to a fake news report, Habana was shot during a drive-by shooting in the French capital. &#8220;He had been wounded in the head and was pronounced dead at the scene,&#8221; the &#8220;report&#8221; stated. But Habana, currently turning out for French giants Toulon, is alive and well. I&#39;m all good pic.twitter.com/c4eTc6mL7H &mdash; Bryan Habana (@BryanHabana) May 4, 2017 &#8220;Apparently there is a massive rumour or false story going around that I have been killed. But as you can see I&#8217;m all alive, I&#8217;m doing well and enjoying the south of France,&#8221; the Springbok legend, who has scored 65 Test tries, said. &#8220;It&#8217;s actually unbelievably disturbing that people can do stuff like that which has a massive impact on people&#8217;s lives.&#8221; A closer look at the report makes it abundantly clear that it&#8217;s fake news. One phrase describes him as a &#8220;wing commander&#8221;. And, frustratingly, there&#8217;s also a sentence: &#8220;He was found dead in a pool of blood, strangled to death&#8221;.
