A rather &#8220;uneasy&#8221; Proteas team will be given extra security on their tour to England in the wake of Monday night&#8217;s terror attack in Manchester. Team manager Mohammed Moosajee on Tuesday confirmed they&#8217;ve already been briefed on the latest developments and new arrangements. Also read: Parnell and De Kock shine as openers in Proteas win &#8220;There have already been reassurances and guarantees put in place,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The security arrangements, as they stand, will be supplemented. There&#8217;s a heightened sense of awareness and we&#8217;ve been guaranteed of more visible policing at stadiums and training venues.&#8221; South Africa are in the United Kingdom until August and begin their journey Wednesday with the first of three ODIs against England in Leeds. They then play in the ICC Champions Trophy before a four-Test series. Of particular concern for the Proteas is the fact that their hotel in Manchester &#8211; where the final Test will be played from 4 to 8 August &#8211; is within walking distance from the Manchester Arena, where the blast occurred and claimed 22 lives. &#8220;There have been some genuine concerns and the players have sought reassurances,&#8221; said Moosajee. &#8220;As things stand, I&#8217;m comfortable with the arrangements but we&#8217;re also eager to see what measures are put in place in other cities.&#8221; The Proteas also aren&#8217;t planning on abandoning the tour. &#8220;Look, we&#8217;re honest enough to have conversations about whether to stay or not,&#8221; said Moosajee. &#8220;If this had happened in any other country, we&#8217;d have the exact same talks. As long as we are given the right information and have the all-clear from our security consultants, we won&#8217;t easily leave. &#8220;I don&#8217;t really think the players would be happier to stay in the UK after a terror attack than somewhere else. There&#8217;s this perception that first world countries are better equipped to deal with these incidents. But when things go wrong, they go wrong anywhere in the world.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
