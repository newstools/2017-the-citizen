The African National Congress study group on the standing committee on public accounts (Scopa) has welcomed the suspension of South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) acting chief executive officer James Aguma. This suspension follows a recent recommendation by Scopa that he be placed on suspension while the interim SABC board conducts its forensic investigation into irregularities in procurement and expenditure at the SABC, study group chairman Mnyamezeli Booi said on Saturday. We are confident of the efforts by the interim SABC board in their commitment of restoring good governance and public confidence in our public broadcaster, he said. Aguma, who is also the permanent chief financial officer of the broadcaster, has reportedly been replaced as acting CEO by Tselidso Ralithabo.
