Europe &#8220;must take its fate into its own hands&#8221; faced with a western alliance divided by Brexit and Donald Trump&#8217;s presidency, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Sunday. &#8220;The times in which we could completely depend on others are on the way out. I&#8217;ve experienced that in the last few days,&#8221; Merkel told a crowd at an election rally in Munich, southern Germany. &#8220;We Europeans truly have to take our fate into our own hands,&#8221; she added. While Germany and Europe would strive to remain on good terms with America and Britain, &#8220;we have to fight for our own destiny&#8221;, Merkel went on. Special emphasis was needed on warm relations between Berlin and newly-elected French President Emmanuel Macron, she said. The chancellor had just returned from a G7 summit which wound up Saturday without a deal between the US and the other six major advanced nations on upholding the 2015 Paris climate accords. Merkel on Saturday labelled the result of the &#8220;six against one&#8221; discussion &#8220;very difficult, not to say very unsatisfactory&#8221;. Trump offered a more positive assessment on Twitter Sunday, writing: &#8220;Just returned from Europe. Trip was a great success for America. Hard work but big results!&#8221; The US president had earlier tweeted that he would reveal whether or not the US would stick to the global emissions deal &#8212; which he pledged to jettison on the campaign trail &#8212; only next week. On a previous leg of his first trip abroad as president, Trump had repeated past criticism of NATO allies for failing to meet the defensive alliance&#8217;s military spending commitment of two percent of GDP. Observers noted that he neglected to publicly endorse the pact&#8217;s Article Five, which guarantees that member countries will aid the others they are attacked. The omission was especially striking as he unveiled a memorial to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks against the US, the only time the mutual defence clause has been triggered. Trump also reportedly described German trade practices as &#8220;bad, very bad,&#8221; in Brussels talks last week, complaining that Europe&#8217;s largest economy sells too many cars to the US. Sunday&#8217;s event saw Merkel renew bonds with the Christian Social Union (CSU), Bavarian sister party to her own centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), ahead of a parliamentary vote in September. Polls show the chancellor, in power since 2005, on course to be re-elected for a fourth term. Agence France-Presse For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
