If Luvo Manyonga had to pin up a poster before the weekend&#8217;s Diamond League meet in Shanghai, the message would be simple. &#8220;Make the first jump count&#8221;. Conventional wisdom tells South Africa&#8217;s current long jump kingpin he could pace himself but that&#8217;s not the way the 25-year-old sees it. Instead, if he&#8217;s going to maintain his cracking current form &#8211; he&#8217;s jumped an African record of 8.65m in 2017 already &#8211; Manyonga will have get the first punch in on Saturday. He admits his strategy of getting the first jump right is based on last year&#8217;s chaos at the National Champs in Stellenbosch. Manyonga overstepped five times during that meet and struggled for momentum. He doesn&#8217;t want to experience that again. &#8220;That was definitely a turning point in my career,&#8221; said Manyonga, a silver medallist at last year&#8217;s Olympics. &#8220;Ever since my coach keeps reminding me that with a good first jump you buy five more.&#8221; But his coach, Neil Cornelius, has another reason for insisting he set the platform early. &#8220;I think in Shanghai the athletes might just be vying to get a psychological upper hand. One good jump for any athlete could get the others to start worrying,&#8221; said Cornelius. Indeed, Manyonga is competing against a high-quality field. One of his competitors is American Jeff Henderson, the man who pipped him for gold in Rio. He&#8217;ll also have to be wary of fellow countryman Khotso Mokoena and Rushwal Samaai. Samaai, however, is the only competitor at the moment who&#8217;s in decent form. Not that that will make Manyonga complacent. For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
