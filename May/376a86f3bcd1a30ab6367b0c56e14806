It was believed that the driver lost control of his car and the car then rolled about 60 metres into a nearby veld at about 1.55am, ER24 spokeswoman Annine Siddall said. At the time of their arrival, ER24 paramedics found the car on its roof and then found the man lying a few metres away from the car. Unfortunately nothing could be done for the man and he was declared dead on the scene. The man had no form of identification with him. Local authorities would investigate the incident, Siddall said.
