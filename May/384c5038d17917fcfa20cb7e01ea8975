Poland&#8217;s president on Saturday said he wants a &#8220;reset&#8221; in ties with France under President-elect Emmanuel Macron, which soured last year when Warsaw abruptly dropped a multi-billion euro deal with a French aeronautics firm. &#8220;I&#8217;m counting on France&#8217;s new presidency to make&#8230; a reset possible,&#8221; Poland&#8217;s President Andrzej Duda said, quoted by the Polish PAP news agency after a telephone conversation with Macron. Duda said Macron told him he wanted &#8220;good&#8221; bilateral ties, adding that they agreed to meet during the May 25 NATO summit in Brussels. Macron drew ire in Warsaw for campaigning on a promise that if elected, he would push for EU sanctions against Poland over alleged rule of law violations by its right-wing government. As the outsourcing of jobs from a factory based in his hometown to Poland became a hot campaign issue, Macron also accused Poles of so-called &#8220;social dumping&#8221;, or using lower labour costs to draw foreign investors. Relations between Warsaw and Paris first soured last October after the Poles called off negotiations with France&#8217;s Airbus to buy 50 of its Caracal helicopters for several billion euros (dollars). Duda also said he agreed to Macron&#8217;s proposal for a meeting of the so-called &#8220;Weimar Triangle&#8221; group comprising France, German and Poland that last met in 2011 under Poland&#8217;s previous liberal government. Eurozone heavyweights France and Germany are pushing for a &#8220;multi-speed&#8221; EU as the bloc prepares for Brexit. Poland and other younger eastern members still outside the eurozone oppose it, worried that they could be left behind.
