It seems rapper Cassper Nyovest has finally reached his limit with haters, as he has served one of his haters on Twitter with the most unexpected answer. Cassper Nyovest has always insisted he was a humble man, one of the things rival AKA has criticised him for, saying they were simply two sides of the same coin. Cassper shared his Thuto album tracklist and, as usual, those who do not like his music criticised it, with some tweeting him their negativity. One user tweeted they were tired of Cassper rapping about his Bentleys and Rolex because everyone knew this by now. The Mama I Made It hit maker got tired of being nice and responded to the &#8220;tired&#8221; argument, further setting the record straight on his possessions. &#8220;It&#8217;s two Bentleys, a new V Class and new sprinter, five Rolexes and I&#8217;m rich as fuck [sic],&#8221; he told the follower. This arguement is tired bro but for the record. It&#39;s 2 Bentleys, A new V Class and new sprinter, 5 Rolexes and I&#39;m rich as fuck!! https://t.co/qaOKAJjKfP &mdash; Abuti Fill Up (@CassperNyovest) May 4, 2017 Cassper further told his fans that he had to stop trying to prove to people that he could rap. &#8220;I had to start impressing myself and having fun,&#8221; he said. Hell yeah im successful!!! I had to accept that before anybody else had to accept it. I can&#39;t hide my joy!!! I&#39;m having the time of my life! &mdash; Abuti Fill Up (@CassperNyovest) May 4, 2017 &#8220;I can&#8217;t run away from how successful I am. I also can&#8217;t lie on songs just to make certain individuals comfortable with my music. &#8220;Hell yeah I&#8217;m successful!!! I had to accept that before anybody else had to accept it.

Get inspired, he said, further telling his fans that they should look up to him and know that everything is possible &#8220;through prayer&#8221;. The rapper has been trending since, with most saying his response was the best. His latest offering, Thuto, is coming out tomorrow and Cassper says it is his best work yet.
