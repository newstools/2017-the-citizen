Police in Masisi, outside Thohoyandou, have launched a search for 17-year-old Nelson Advance Muleya, who disappeared after telling family members he was going to a local clinic. Limpopo police spokesperson Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe on Thursday said the missing teenager was last seen on Monday. Before he was reported missing, Muleya was thought to have gone to a local clinic and then to Donal Frazer Hospital for a checkup. After family members realised that he was nowhere to be found, they immediately went to both the clinic and hospital, but were told that he never arrived. They immediately reported the matter to the local police station, said Ngoepe. Preliminary police investigations reveal that his friend called him later that day, and he told her that he was kidnapped and did not know where he was. Police urged the community to remain calm while the search and investigation continue. Last week, angry community members in Vhalaudzi outside Louis Trichardt turned on the police. They burned down a local police station and two state vehicles after a woman went missing in the area. Police discovered her body days later in the bushes after the dead woman s boyfriend led investigators to the shallow grave. The arrested boyfriend will soon be put on trial for the murder of 25-year-old Mavis Mabala.
