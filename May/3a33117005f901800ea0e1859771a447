Though she had to put up a fight on Saturday night, middle-distance specialist Caster Semenya stretched her lengthy unbeaten streak with another fine performance at the third leg of the Diamond League series in Eugene. Holding off a challenge from Kenyan athlete Margaret Wambui all the way to the line, Semenya secured victory in the women&#8217;s 800m race in 1:57.78 at the annual Prefontaine Classic. While she was more than a second outside her own world lead set in Doha earlier this month, it was the third fastest two-lap performance of the season, with Wambui finishing just 0.10 off the pace. Semenya extended her unbeaten run to 21 months over the 400m, 800m and 1 500m distances. The fourth of 14 legs in the Diamond League campaign will be held in Rome on June 8.
