Production for the Mitsubishi Lancer will end in August, and the company will say goodbye by introducing the new Limited Edition trim level. Rather than sitting at the top of the lineup as a fond farewell to the model, instead, the company places the Limited Edition just a rung above the base ES grade. . &#8220;The Lancer has a long-standing tradition of providing consumers unparalleled value at an attractive price, so it was only fitting we pay tribute to the sedan with a Limited Edition trim offering,&#8221; Don Swearingen, chief operating officer of Mitsubishi Motors North America, said in the model s announcement. Revised trim on the upper grille, fenders, and door mirrors distinguish the new model on the outside, and there&#8217;s a black roof. The sedan rides on black 16-inch wheels. Inside, all Limited-Edition models have black fabric upholstery with a smattering of red stitching, like on the steering wheel, armrest, door trim and elsewhere. The 6.5-inch infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto also features a gloss black surround. Aluminum pedals covers provide a slightly sporty look, and there s a standard sunroof. The powertrain is identical to the base ES model. The Lancer Limited Edition uses a 2.0-litre four-cylinder with 110kW and 197Nm of torque, and the engines routes to the wheels through a CVT. . The company is now putting its focus on building crossovers, and the decision makes sense. Local availability of the model is still unclear at this stage.
