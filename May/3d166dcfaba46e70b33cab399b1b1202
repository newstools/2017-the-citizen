Trainer Duncan Howells has a decent string of horses and his stable appears to be in good form currently. He sends out a number of runners at today s Scottsville meeting but the pick could come in Race 8 where he saddles Rainbowinthesky. The three-year-old filly has been lightly raced and is only a one-time winner from five starts. However, she has placed in three other events and off a merit rating of 76 in this FM 74 Handicap over 1000m, looks perfectly positioned to notch up a second victory. In the past the draw has been vital and it would have been regarded as insane to punt a runner who is drawn No 16 up the undulating straight. Ironically this filly s only win came over 1200m at this track where she jumped from No 15 stall. After winning a Maiden Plate, Rainbowinthesky took a jump in class into a FM 80 Handicap over 1200m. She did well to finish third, beaten jut 0.75 lengths by Cosmic Burst. Her last start was again over 1200m at Scottsville, in a MR 79 Handicap, and she was not disgraced. She hit the front at the 400m mark but was run out of it and ended up in third, 1.55 lengths behind Trippi s Girl. Silk Trip is another lightly raced filly, having only run three times. She ran out a 4.25-length winner at Kenilworth in her second start after which trainer Andre Nel took her to Johannesburg where she finished a 3.20-length fourth over 1000m at Turffontein in February. She has not raced since but if close to peak fitness Silk Trip looks a definite threat.
