Ntsiki Mazwai posted a video on Instagram on Thursday morning questioning why woman entertainers such as Beyonce, Kelly Khumalo and Nadia Nakai use sex a weapon to lure people to buy their music. On the video, she throws massive shade at entertainers who perform half-naked onstage. &#8220;I just don&#8217;t get it. I don&#8217;t get how women play into being sexually objectified,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I think women like Kelly Khumalo and Nadia Nakai are distracting us from their talent because they are always naked. It is a little bit awkward because I am not sure if you are selling the music or your sexy body,&#8221; she said. Why are women nqunu on stage???
