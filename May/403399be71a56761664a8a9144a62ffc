Joburg s richest raceday will take place at Turffontein Racecourse tomorrow with more than R11 million up for grabs. The Highveld Autumn season reaches its climax on Champions Day which sees the running of four Grade 1 and four Grade 2 races. There are 12 races on the card and the massive Pick 6 pool is forecast to reach R5.1 million. However, in terms of a new ruling, there will be a guaranteed R4.5 million in the pool. The R4 million President s Champions Challenge run over 2 000m is one of the richest races on the SA calendar and this race looks to be at the mercy of Legal Eagle, who is the highest rated horse in the country. He won the race last year and looks set to give trainer Sean Tarry and jockey Anton Marcus a race double. Bookmakers have taken no chance and he has been priced up at 4/10. The R2 million SA Derby is the final leg of the SA Triple Crown but no horse can now win all three and claim the R2 million bonus. Nevertheless, Mike de Kock has trained the winners of the first two legs so should Heavenly Blue claim the Derby, then the multiple SA Champion conditioner will have trained all three Triple Crown winners. Unfortunately there is no bonus for that feat. The Highveld, with its dry climate, produces some of the fastest times for sprints in SA and the speedsters will be out in full force to contest the R1 million Computaform Sprint over 1 000m. Unless there is wet weather around, this race is usually all over in less than 56 seconds. The SA Nursery over 1 160m is the only Grade 1 race for juveniles on the Highveld and with exciting juveniles around the race looks like it will be an absolute corker. The Intercontinental Village will also be open at Turffontein where visitors will be able to taste food from all over the world.
