Following the launch of the current generation Audi R8 last year, the Ingolstadt-based automaker is hard at work readying to launch its R8 Spyder in SA this month. . The R8 Spyder was revealed in New York in March 2016, and local dealers have started taking deliveries of the drop-top units, but keep in mind that the official market launch is set for later this month. Powered by same engine that powers the hard-top version, the R8 is lighter than its predecessor. Under the hood lurks a naturally aspirated 5.2-litre V10 good for 397 kW and 540 Nm. The 449kW and 560Nm V10 Plus still tops the list as the most powerful R8. A sprint from 0-100km/h is claimed at a time of 3.6 seconds for the Spyder (one-tenth slower than the base coup ), with top speed coming in at 318 km/h. An electrohydraulic drive opens and closes the roof in 20 seconds, up to a speed of 50 km/h. . The Audi R8 5.2 V10 Spyder quattro will start at R2 905 500, some R170 000 more expensive than the coup on which it is based. The V10 Plus coup , comes in at R3 089 000. &nbsp; . &nbsp; . &nbsp;
