The man many have said is at the centre of the violent protests rocking Eldorado Park, Camissa leader Jerome Lottering, has made a public appeal to &#8220;restore normality&#8221; to the area, but he denies that he is behind a message claiming President Jacob Zuma declared Eldorado Park a &#8220;war zone&#8221; on Tuesday. The message further says that the SA National Defence Force will &#8220;clean down&#8221; the area. &#8220;As your controller&#8221;, the man tells protesters to stand down and return to their houses and lock their doors. The voice note, originally thought by some to be from the &#8220;coloured consciousness&#8221; Camissa chairman Lottering, started circulating on WhatsApp on Tuesday, but Lottering later released a statement saying it was not his message.
