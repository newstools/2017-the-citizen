President Donald Trump warned sacked FBI chief James Comey on Friday not to &#8220;leak&#8221; details of their conversations to the media, and suggested they may have been recorded. &#8220;James Comey better hope that there are no &#8216;tapes&#8217; of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!&#8221; Trump wrote in one of a series of early morning tweets assailing critics and the media over their response to Comey&#8217;s ouster. Trump revealed that he had asked the former FBI director on three occasions whether he was a target in a probe into alleged Russian election meddling, before firing him earlier this week.
