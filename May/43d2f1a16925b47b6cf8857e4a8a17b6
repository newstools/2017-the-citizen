The pair have taken to YouTube to apologise for their outburst, which made headlines on Saturday, straight after the Samas. Babes was nominated in several categories, including Best Newcomer and Record of the Year. She lost out to Amanda Black and Nasty C. Though she closed the ceremony, performing her hit track, Wololo, she was upset and immediately recorded a video in which she questioned the judging process of the Samas. This isn&#8217;t the first time Babes has been a sore loser. After she left empty-handed at the Metro FM awards earlier this year, she said she would boycott award ceremonies if she didn&#8217;t win anything. Her reasons included watching artists who were not fully booked last year win categories she had also been nominated in. In the video, Babes and Mampintsha said they wanted to apologise to their fans and to everyone they might have offended.
