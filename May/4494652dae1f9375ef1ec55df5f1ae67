Local rapper Cassper Nyovest released his third studio album last night, and fans on social media cannot keep their mouths shut about how amazing the album is. The young CEO named his third musical offering after his sister, &#8216;Thuto&#8217;. The rapper revealed that the album is his best work yet, and it seems everyone agrees with him. So a week or two ago @casspernyovest gave me a hard copy of his album after telling me and the rest of the country countless times that this is his best work, I was looking forward to hearing it. So is this his best album yet? Is Tito Mboweni as he says not the best song? Has he lost focus on the music? I&#8217;ve written a full breakdown of things #Thuto will teach you about Cassper Nyovest. In my opinion, in all his catalogue this is the most consistent and cohesive album but check the site to see what that means. #slikouronlife A post shared by Siya Metane (@slikouronlife) on May 4, 2017 at 6:36am PDT Friday is that you my N**** , may you all have a fun and blessed day #livingmylife #mood #happy #wokeuplikethis #thuto #foreveryoung #lit #issaparty A post shared by Ndash The cooker &#x1f37d; (@o_lordd) on May 4, 2017 at 11:41pm PDT &nbsp; Had to take off my sweater, was sweating after the intro! hip hop is a sport and #thuto is in the lead! pic.twitter.com/L67PnqTW60 &mdash; Len (@Morogo_K) May 5, 2017 &nbsp; #Thuto well done man it&#39;s a classic pic.twitter.com/iYhRe3xo1Q &mdash; Athi (@YMagxala) May 5, 2017 Can we please find Casspers Ghost writer #Thuto showed me a new Cassper pic.twitter.com/ZWyGHr2rEC &mdash; Chief Mize (@Aysap_) May 5, 2017 &quot;These beats beg for life when I get on to them &quot; &#8211; Nyuku @CassperNyovest #Thuto pic.twitter.com/rEy29bZoSa &mdash; BAREND ROTHSCHILD (@barend_g) May 4, 2017 Some fans are even contemplating leaving work just so they can get have a good listen to the album.
