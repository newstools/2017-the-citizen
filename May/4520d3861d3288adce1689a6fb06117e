Proteas Test opener Dean Elgar suffered an embarrassing way to get out in an English county championship game at the weekend. The left-hander, who&#8217;s been in excellent form for Somerset ahead of South Africa&#8217;s Test series against England, was bowled by a delivery that bounced twice. Yes, Elgar was dismissed by a double bouncer &#8230; from a leg-spinner!

It then turned viciously but kept on dipping. Elgar, batting confidently on 60, tried to pull and missed. It was a crazy way to get out.
