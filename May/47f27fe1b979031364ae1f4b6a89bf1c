Coach Allister Coetzee made it clear on Tuesday in announcing his new squad that he wants the Springboks to experience a Lions-like revival in 2017. As a result, he&#8217;s chosen one of the men who were key to helping the Lions rise again, Warren Whiteley, as his new captain for the three Tests against France. Also read: Warren Whiteley named Springbok captain &#8220;I made up my mind a long time ago that Warren should be captain, he was the logical choice because in a tough season last year, he captained the team anyway whenever Adriaan Strauss was not on the field,&#8221; said Coetzee. &#8220;When you look at the characteristics of a captain, how a Springbok captain looks, then it is not a difficult decision. Warren understands captaincy both on the field and off it, and it s a big challenge being Springbok captain because we live in a unique land with unique questions. But Warren has been on quite a rough road in his career, he knows resilience.&#8221; Despite the 29-year-old&#8217;s obvious leadership qualities, it&#8217;s also easy to justify his place in the national side because he&#8217;s been the best local No 8 in the current Super Rugby campaign. &#8220;Warren brings out the best in people. But most importantly he has been playing good rugby, he was first of all selected as a consistent performer, the best eighthman in the country. He will glue a young Springbok side together,&#8221; said Coetzee. The recall of veteran Duane Vermeulen also reveals how team management view their best loose trio. Coetzee confirmed that Vermeulen will be used on the flank alongside Whiteley at eighthman. &#8220;I ve had numerous chats with Duane and I believe they complement each other very well, they could be a great combination,&#8221; he said. &#8220;At the Stormers, there was always chat about playing Duane at seven: he s great in the lineouts, he s a strong defender and he can run off nine, plus he can play towards the ball as well.&#8221; The under-pressure coach also defended the inclusion of Frans Steyn, who still divides opinion despite his experience. &#8220;Frans Steyn can add value, we ve monitored him very closely and he has played both 10 and 12 for Montpellier this year. If guys still have the passion to play for South Africa, then they can play a role,&#8221; said Coetzee. For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
