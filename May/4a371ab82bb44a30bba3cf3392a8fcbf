Despite the disappointment of losing the short ODI series against England on Saturday, Proteas skipper AB de Villiers was more &#8220;upset&#8221; over his side &#8211; apparently &#8211; being subtly accused of tampering with the ball. The captain was called by the umpires during the 34th over of the England innings to discuss the state of the ball used at that end. De Villiers was clearly emotional during the conversation.

I was quite upset about that. I don&#8217;t know what else I can say. &#8220;It&#8217;s done and dusted. There were no fines given.&#8221; Two different balls are used at both ends during an ODI and the one under the microscope was the one with which left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj, on debut, bowled. &#8220;I honestly told the umpires we had nothing to do with the condition of ball, except for the fact that Keshav bowled five overs on the trot from that end. The ball generally scuffs up when the spinner bowls a few overs. I expressed my views about that and we moved on,&#8221; said De Villiers. &#8220;I felt it was a bad ball. That happens sometimes. The leather comes off and you do get that. Unfortunately the umpires didn&#8217;t agree. Nothing happened, generally there&#8217;s a warning or a fine, none of that happened, which tells me they realised we were innocent.&#8221; Pressed further on whether he felt the umpires was accusing the Proteas of wrongdoing, De Villiers admitted: &#8220;Yes. That&#8217;s the feeling that I got and I expressed that I was quite upset about it. But like I said, no further steps were taken from both parties.&#8221; The drama overshadowed a thrilling game of cricket, where South Africa actually wasted many opportunities and clearly panicked in the last over. But De Villiers wasn&#8217;t willing to pin the blame on anyone. &#8220;I thought the boys played a great hand at the end there, to get us so close,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I got a bit excited and thought we had it in the bag. But you&#8217;ve got to give credit to the last two bowlers of England. They showed some great skill and good plans.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
