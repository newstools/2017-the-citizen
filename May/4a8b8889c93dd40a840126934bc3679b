Embattled state-owned power utility Eskom will be subjected to a full-scale investigation by the Special Investigative Unit (SIU) and a retired judge, Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown said on Thursday. The probe will have a broad scope and review all seven reports emanating from previous investigations, including the parastatal s coal-procurement processes and former public protector Thuli Madonsela s state capture report, Fin24 reported. There have been seven reports on Eskom dating back to 2007 into alleged wrongdoing and impropriety, and I d like to have a deep dive into these issues, Brown said. The minister said her department had a memorandum of understanding with the SIU to review the allegations and the retired judge would make recommendations on the remedial action that needs to be taken, according to the report. She also said she would brief the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) on all the recommendations made following the investigation.
