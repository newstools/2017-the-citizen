Residents of Greater Eldorado Park which includes the areas of Freedom Park, Slovo Park and Devland have been protesting since the early hours of Monday morning. The protests are understood to be related to the need for RDP houses in the area, among other things. Residents blocked roads around the area, heavily affecting traffic on the Golden Highway. Several people, including journalists, were injured when stones were thrown on the highway. Several vehicles have been damaged and police visibility has been increased. Numerous shops, including: Spar, Shoprite, Pep and BP garage have been looted. Helicopters have been seen circling the area to monitor the protest. The strike follows a meeting held at the Don Mateman Civic Centre yesterday afternoon. The meeting was conducted by Camissa leader, Jerome Lottering. Lottering said he met with residents about issues concerning land, however the residents were livid at the meeting. Evidently, the residents resorted to violence to communicate their unprecedented grievances.
