The sudden death of Umkhonto weSizwe (MK) military veteran Simon Senna has saddened politicians in the North West province. Senna, a former mayor of Ramotshere-Moiloa local municipality in the North West, died on Tuesday after a short illness. Yesterday, the mayor of Ngaka Modiri Molema District in the province, Tshepo Makolomakwa, and former colleagues at Ramotshere-Moiloa local municipality sent messages of condolence to the Senna family. Simon Senna, our MK veteran, was one of the greatest leaders in Ngaka Modiri Molema District and the political fraternity. He took over as mayor as part of an intervention team that rescued the municipality from the alleged maladministration and mismanagement. He brought stability and hope to the community of Ramotshere-Moiloa and was a long-serving, senior member of the world of politics, said Makolomakwa in a statement. As an idealistic politician and a senior citizen, he was always prepared for tough debates in council to advance the interest of the people. The contribution he made towards the new democratic leadership in Bokone Bophirima will forever be remembered. He was loved for his simplicity and as an ordinary person who lived amongst the people. We will surely miss his ways of resolving matters. ALSO READ: Can God still find a seat in an SA classroom? For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
