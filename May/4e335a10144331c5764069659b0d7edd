Kaizer Chiefs goalkeeper Itumeleng Khume has reportedly found love in the arms of former Greed &amp; Desire actor Kamo Letsosa. A close source told Sunday Sun that Letsosa was &#8220;madly in love&#8221;, but could, however, not say the same about Khune because &#8220;everyone knows how soccer stars behave&#8221;. According to the source, it would be a &#8220;pity&#8221; if Khune broke her heart she really loved him. The couple, who apparently can&#8217;t keep their hands off each other, have reportedly been together for three months. Kamo, who is always with Khune&#8217;s friends, is said to be the right woman for him as she is not a liker of things, &#8220;like the other girls he has dated&#8221;. The couple refused to comment on the reports. Khune has date Minnie Dlamini, who in December last year announced her engagement to Quinton Jones. After Minnie, he dated fitness trainer Sbahle Mpisane, who also announced their breakup last year. However, it seems Khune has moved on with the actor.
