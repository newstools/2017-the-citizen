There was no evidence to suggest that the man accused of allegedly plotting to assassinate South African government officials including cabinet ministers, perceived as beneficiaries of state capture, is a coup plotter, the National Prosecuting Authority said on Tuesday. Spokesperson Phindi Mjonondwane said their evidence also proved that the man was acting alone, but she was unable to comment on the evidence which was available. At this stage we don t have information that suggest that this was a coup plot as the NPA, she told reporters outside the Johannesburg Magistrate s Court. Elvis Ramosebudi briefly appeared in a packed courtroom before Magistrate Vincent Ratshibvumo on Tuesday. Ramosebudi came up the dock and seemed unfazed by all the attention from journalist, as he smiled and greeted his lawyer. The 33-year-old was arrested last week Wednesday, bu the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (Hawks), who said in October investigators intercepted communication of possible assassinations, which were being planned. As many as 19 people were allegedly targeted. State Prosecutor Advocate Johan Badenhorst said they have decided to change the charges from conspiracy to commit murder to incitement to commit murder. Mjonondwane said the chargers were changed because the evidence gathered indicate that Ramosebudi was acting alone and did not conspire with anyone. He incited people from Anglo-American He actually wrote a letter to a former employee of Anglo-American requesting an amount of R60 million to further his crime. On his last appearance, the State said they intend to have Ramosebudi referred to a mental observation because of the dodgy coup plot he was allegedly planning. Mjonondwane said the decision to refer Ramosebudi to a mental hospital will be determined after investigations have been completed. More investigation must be conducted in order for us as the State to come to a conclusion whether to refer the accused to mental observation or not.
