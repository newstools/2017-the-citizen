There&#8217;s a nostalgic feel to this season&#8217;s Springbok jersey. The South African Rugby Union (Saru) and it&#8217;s kit supplier Asics on Wednesday officially unveiled the new design. One of the main features is the return of the gold collar, which is considered &#8220;old school&#8221; and is a hallmark of previous Bok jerseys. &#8220;The jersey represents a traditional look and feel with a modern touch. The green chest and back area has a scattering of mini springboks spread across the surface for added detail. The gold collar adds a touch of class to round off a classic rugby jersey,&#8221; Saru said in a statement. While the jersey looks a tad tight on bigger men like veteran prop Beast Mtawarira, it&#8217;s actually scientifically designed to be comfortable. &#8220;The match jerseys feature a tight fit with minimum underarm seams for maximum comfort as well as a traditional rugby collar with modern quick release snap closure,&#8221; the statement added. Mtawarira himself said he is excited to pull over the jersey. The new jersey looks amazing and I can t wait to play in it. It looks simple yet stylish and with the tight fit and grippers it is technically brilliant as well. For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
