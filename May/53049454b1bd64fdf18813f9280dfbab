It says much of Aiden Markram&#8217;s strong character that he&#8217;s taking leadership into his stride at a young age. The 22-year-old opening batter seems to be following a similar path to Graeme Smith after Cricket South Africa (CSA) decided to hand him the captaincy of the South Africa &#8216;A&#8217; side in the four-day format for the tour to England. Not bad for a player on his first major national assignment. Also read: Aiden Markram s burden: Being the new Graeme Smith &#8220;Yeah, the captaincy is something exciting to look forward to,&#8221; said Markram on the eve of SA &#8216;A&#8217;s departure to the UK. &#8220;Being one of the younger guys in the squad, it&#8217;s something to treasure. You can find yourself very star struck but I hope it&#8217;s something I learn from.&#8221; Markram had been singled out as a viable leader for the future as long as three years back, when he led the national Under-19 side &#8211; featuring a certain Kagiso Rabada &#8211; to World Cup glory. There, however, he led men of the same age. Now he&#8217;s dealing with a whole different dynamic, one where quite a few senior players need to be led. But Markram isn&#8217;t easily intimidated. &#8220;The presence of a few experienced guys definitely can be intimidating for a young captain,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But I have to say, the bunch of guys we have in this team are really nice people. They make it very easy to take control.&#8221; In fact, Markram clearly has invested time in planning how he&#8217;ll approach his captaincy. &#8220;The key is to get some of the senior guys onto your side from the outset. You have to use their experience,&#8221; he said. &#8220;When you do that, you can approach a senior guy when you&#8217;re feeling a bit under pressure. It&#8217;s about striving for a balance.&#8221; Following a breakthrough season at the Titans, the national selectors have subtly suggested a good tour in the UK could mean Markram gets an opportunity to play international cricket by the start of next season. Yet he&#8217;s very much aware of putting too much pressure on himself. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to give that too much thought,&#8221; said Markram. &#8220;The person I am, it can only add pressure on me and I don&#8217;t want to do that. There&#8217;s a fair amount on my plate already but it&#8217;s a nice thought for the back of the mind.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
