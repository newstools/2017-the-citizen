Arusha. The Tanzania Association of Tour Operators (Tato) has pleaded with the government to eliminate tariff and non-tariff barriers inhibiting growth of the tourism industry in its 2017/18 Budget.Tato chairman Wilbard Chambulo said in an interview that the Budget should treat the tourism industry as an export service by ensuring multiple taxes, licenses and fees currently imposed on the sector are streamlined.Tour operators argue that whereas tourism is an export, and like other export services, qualifies for VAT exemption or zero rating, tour operators and travel agencies are intermediary services which are normally not subject to VAT.On July 1, 2016 Tanzania enforced VAT on tourism services, amid outcry from all corners, inflating its tourism products for 25 per cent more than similar offerings from the region.Tato says that before introduction of VAT the destination was considered a 7 per cent more expensive, compared to Kenya, Botswana, South Africa and Angola.Kenya learned a hard lesson in 2015 when it imposed VAT on tourist services, thanks to a quick rebound, which seeks to restore their competitiveness and glory in the tourism sector.Charging VAT on tourist services, Tato says, has made them expensive and placed the Tanzanian tourism industry in a disadvantaged position due to regional and international parities. We would like our government to understand that tourist services have high demand elasticity as consumers have a wide choice of attractive destinations worldwide Tato says in statement.Tato further says that tourism is customer-controlled business and tourists are very fragile and sensitive to adverse changes and events in tourist destination territories.For tour operators, it defeats their common sense to exempt transportation (regular and scheduled) services and charge VAT on tourist guiding, game driving, water safaris, animal or bird watching and park fees while the whole tourism business is about transporting people or tourists to the national parks. It is practically not possible to draw a line between transportation and other tourist services reads the statement, adding that park fees are also a form of tax or levy and it makes no sense charging VAT on another tax.Tato says that it understands that loopholes in system allow many unregistered companies to operate and deny the highly needed revenue to the government.The association says that honest tour operators and travel agents should not be punished because of dishonest operators. Tato is open and willing to work with the government in widening the tax base and dealing with dishonest operators the statement concludes.The budget should also lower off-season park fees, remove single entry park fees and do away with duplication of fees and levies between Wildlife Management Areas (WMAs) and national parks, he said.A joint report by the Tanzania Confederation of Tourism (TCT) and Best-Dialogue on assessment of the Tanzanian tourism sector shows paperwork and administrative procedures are weighing down on investors in the industry.A tour operator, for instance, has to spend over four months on accomplishing a regulatory paperwork, let alone procedures for renewing his license and paying mandatory taxes consuming 745 extra hours each year.An average annual cost for a local tour operator to accomplish the regulatory paperwork, according to the report, stands at $1,381. Licences, taxes and levies for tourism businesses place a heavy cost in terms of time and money, observed Mr Chambulo, adding that sudden changes on the same undermined credibility of the industry overseas. A 12-month notice before the introduction of new fees, levies and other charges will create the much-needed trust in the market for us to remain competitive globally, Mr Chambulo explained.The Tato chief executive officer, Mr Sirili Akko, concurred with Mr Chambulo, saying tour operators were in dire need of streamlined taxes, given high cost and multiplicity of the same inhibiting voluntary compliance. Multiple taxes, levies and fees on tourism, players say, make Tanzania to be expensive destination. We need to address the issue of multiple taxes, if we are going to succeed to bring two million tourists to Tanzania by 2020 and compete with other countries with the similar attractions says Mr Chambulo.Indeed, tour operators in Tanzania are currently subjected to 32 different taxes, twelve being business registration and regulatory licenses fees as well as 11 duties for each tourist vehicle per annum and nine others.Mr Chambulo added: We also want the tourism industry-related statistics, particularly on tourist arrivals, improved in a bid to make informed decisions. He said in creating an investment-friendly and secure business environment, the Budget should, in addition, consider addressing the yawning skills gap.The Tourism Development Levy (TDL) should be used for the legally intended drive and its collection and disbursement should be transparent and driven by decisions reached along with the private sector, he suggested.Mr Chambulo said the private sector s involvement in the planning and implementation of new and relevant international tourism marketing strategy should be made mandatory. The private sector should be fully involved in reviewing the existing tourism policy in a bid to articulate a new vision and direction with a view of diversifying products and promoting new destinations within Tanzania, he explained, adding: Improvement of tourism infrastructure with emphasis on roads, supply of utilities and energy; and investors access to land for tourism development should also be high on the Budget agenda.Wildlife tourism in Tanzania continues to grow, with more than 1 million guests visit the country annually, earning the country $2.05 billion, equivalent to nearly 17.6 per cent of GDP.Additionally, tourism provides 600,000 direct jobs to Tanzanians; over one million people earn an income from tourism not to mention the value chain of tourism which supports, parks, conservation areas and now community based wildlife management areas (WMA s) but also farmers, transporters, fuel stations, spare parts suppliers, builders, tent manufacturers, suppliers of food and drink.
