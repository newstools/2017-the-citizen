Chelsea star Eden Hazard can do very little wrong this season. The Belgian playmaker has arguably been the most influential figure in the Blues&#8217; romp to English Premier League title and will be hoping to add the FA Cup at the weekend. But there&#8217;s another thing the 26-year-old is pretty good at: the can change the tyres on a Formula car. In an interesting challenge this week, Hazard and F1 veteran Felipe Massa &#8211; who drives for Williams &#8211; swopped careers for a few minutes in deodorant brand Sure&#8217;s &#8220;Wheels vs Drills&#8221; challenge. Hazard is tasked with changing two wheels with the world&#8217;s fastest pit crew, while Massa has to dribble past various dummy players and then beat a goalkeeper to score. The 36-year-old Massa is pretty good and scores his first goal but it&#8217;s Hazard who steals the show with his nifty drilling skills. What a talented man.
