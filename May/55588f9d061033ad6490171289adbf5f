Bongekile &#8216;Babes Wodumo&#8217; Simelane said she would follow in Cassper Nyovest&#8217;s footsteps and refrain from submitting her music for nomination at awards if she does not scoop an award at the South African Music Awards (Samas) this year. The queen of gqom reportedly said she came to the decision after failing to win a single award at the Metros earlier this year despite having been the most nominated artist with four nominations. Some people were &#8220;playing unfair now&#8221;, she reportedly told The Sowetan. Babes Wodumo has been nominated in five categories including Female of the Year, Newcomer of the Year and Best Kwaito Album. Though she told the publication she was happy to have been nominated, she said she was not as excited anymore. The awards will take place at the Sun City Superbowl on May 27. The 16th Metro FM Awards left many artists and fans unhappy with the results. It all began with Riky Rick, who said he was not happy with winning his award because there were talented artists who, while struggling, submitted their music to radio stations but never got airplay. If niggaz can pay for these f***ing awards, then my nigga, I don t want them, he tweeted at the time. DJ Black Coffee also took to social media to share his discontentment with the awards, asking why his remix did not make the cut even though it was played worldwide. Many other artists then followed suit in expressing their anger on social media. Read more: Musicians who were not pleased with Metro FM Awards
