The arrival of the Mercedes-Benz bakkie, dubbed X-Class, seems to be closer than we think. With it being spied testing recently, the recent image proves it is not too far to be seen challenging the likes of the Volkswagen Amarok, Ford Ranger and Toyota Hilux. . Clearly, what is seen testing in traffic is the production-spec X-Class based on the Nissan Navara, and it seems to retain some design elements we have seen on the two concepts unveiled in Sweden in October 2016. Regardless of the heavy camouflage, the headlamps seem to feature distinctive LED daytime running lights. Unfortunately, it s difficult to tell (because of the heavy camouflage obviously) what sort of grille this model is wearing. According to what we have seen in Sweden, the infotainment system sits high on the centre stack, and there s a multifunction touchpad on the console for controlling it. .. Mercedes is partnering with the Renault-Nissan Alliance for building the production version of the X-Class. Nissan s factory in Barcelona, Spain, will build the examples for Europe, Australia and South Africa. Rumours state that the Stuttgart automaker will add its own V6 turbodiesel unit to the top-spec models and promises that it will feel like a true Mercedes . . The production version will be on sale in South Africa in early 2018. Pricing information and specifications to follow prior to its local launch.
