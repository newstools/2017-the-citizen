Rapper Cassper Nyovest, real name Refiloe Phoolo is among the men who took part in the Saturday protests against the abuse of women. He uploaded a short clip in which he can be seen leading a large group singing and marching. Under the banner of #NotInMyName, both men and women gathered to protest gender-based violence and tell their stories. A small but determined crowd gathered in Pretoria on Saturday at Church Square morning to march to the Union Buildings in a statement against the abuse of women in South Africa, which has reached seemingly epidemic proportions. Under the hashtags #NotInOurName and #StopItNow, they have called on men in South Africa to refrain from abusing and murdering women. The march was organised by several NGOs and civil society groups, and supported by several celebrities. The movement had initially kicked off under the hashtag #MenAreTrash in the wake of the high-profile murders of several women and girls, but it has now welcomed the inclusion and support of men, who are being encouraged to say, Not in my name, when it comes to oppressing women. Reports suggest that many young men turned up for the occasion.
