One person died and 10 other people were injured when a light delivery vehicle and taxi collided head-on in Witbank, Mpumalanga on Thursday, paramedics said. ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring said paramedics arrived on the scene at around 3.10pm. Upon closer inspection, paramedics found both wrecked vehicles on the side of the road. Several patients were found walking around on the scene. When paramedics inspected the scene, they found the body of the taxi driver lying trapped inside his vehicle, Meiring said. Unfortunately, the man had already succumbed to his injuries. Nothing could be done for the man and he was declared dead. Approximately 10 other patients were found on the scene, five of them were critically injured. One of the critically injured, a 13-year-old boy, was found lying trapped in the front passenger seat of the taxi. Meiring said that rescue services used specialised equipment to free the boy, and paramedics treated the patients and provided the critically injured with advanced life support interventions. Once treated, the patients were transported to various hospitals in the area for further treatment. The exact cause of the accident was not known and would be investigated, he said.
