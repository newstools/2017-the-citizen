We have been blessed three times over. We are incredibly excited that our family will be growing by three and we would like to thank all of you for your well wishes- Derockas,&#8221; Ntando wrote on Instagram. Things seem to have taken a turn since then, as rumour has it that DJ Junior has been two timing her with his ex-girlfriend Lihle Bhengu. A source close to the couple told Sunday Sun that the couple is now living apart, and the DJ Junior had gone back to his ex-girlfriend. The rumour started when Junior and Lihle posted pictures on Instagram, and although posted separately, the pics suggested that the two were at the same place. And this was fuelled by Juniour s post having a Thank You Baby caption accompanied by a heart, said the source. The source told Sunday Sun that they were all shocked when Junior showed up at his surprise party with Lihle. Another source said the couple had stopped posting pictures together on social media since the pregnancy and that the mother to be has been spending most of her time at home. They used to be inseparable, but now they are cold towards each other, and has become apparent that they are doing their own thing. Remember, Ntando and Junior were planning to get married. But now that dream is fading fast. said the mole. &nbsp; ALSO READ: The top 5 moments from #SAMA23 &nbsp; For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
