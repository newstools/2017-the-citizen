Tini made his mark in 2016 after the release of his 15 track mixtape titled Coming of Age during his matric year with his lead single being Preach . Originally from the Eastern Cape, Tini is not new to the music scene as he has previously worked with artists such as DJ Switch, BlakLez and PDotO. The ascending music creator is known for spitting bars on the Now or Never Remix and he has been moulding a distinct sound for himself which in return has amassed thousands of fans across social media and streaming platforms. I feel very excited about this move because I am going to be giving the music to more people and growing my audience. Secondly, because I have seen what Ambitiouz Entertainment has been able to do for artists on their roster. It s a powerful team and having their expertise would complement the music I make as well as my goals and ambitions he says. Ambitiouz Entertainment is happy welcoming him to the stable. Already dubbed the New School Bully surely nothing but unfiltered, punchy and fiery lyrics are expected from the young wordsmith. So the new school cats are hereby warned! We intend to partner with him on growing his career immensely and defining the next generation Hip Hop. For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
