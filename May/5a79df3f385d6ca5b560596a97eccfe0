It is no secret that when EFF leader Julius Malema is happy, he dances. There is a video that was recently shared by the EFF of its leader doing a dance that left the crowd in stitches. In the video, taken at the party&#8217;s Africa Day celebration in Johannesburg last week, the EFF leader tries to do a Tsonga dance, then ends up tapping his butt as he shakes it, leaving the crowd in laughter. Watch the video below: Commander in Chief, Julius Malema dances before he exits the stage! Thank you to everyone that was present at the #EFFAfricaDay! #Asijiki pic.twitter.com/G4uABstR1N &mdash; EFF Official Account (@EFFSouthAfrica) May 25, 2017 Before Malema, the party&#8217;s deputy president Floyd Shivambu took to the stage to do a Tsonga dance too and perhaps he should consider teaching his leader a few moves.
