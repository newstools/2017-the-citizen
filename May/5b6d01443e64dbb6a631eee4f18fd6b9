Rhythm City&#8216;s Sphamandla Dhludhlu, Keeping Score&#8216;s Unathi Platyi and veteran actor Vusi Thanda, known for his role in Emzini Wezinsizwa as Tshawe, conducted a workshop on acting, which was not a success allegedly because of singer Bulelwa &#8216;Zahara&#8217; Mkutukana&#8217;s empty promises. The workshop, held in East London, and organised as a way of giving back to the community, reportedly left the actors with no transport, accommodation and food after Zahara failed to deliver on her promises. Dhludhlu told The Sowetan that the &#8216;Country Girl&#8217; hit maker promised promised to organise everything, including posters for the event, sound, transport and accommodation. She reportedly only paid for transport to Eastern Cape and failed to attend the event. She apparently kept telling them she was on her way when she knew she was not going to make it. To make matters worse for the artists, Zahara allegedly refused to pay for their trip back to Johannesburg. Zahara slammed the artists, saying they were &#8220;ungrateful&#8221;. She told the publication the artists were &#8220;spitting&#8221; in her face after she took out her own money to help them. She never promised all those &#8220;luxuries&#8221;, as all she offered was to pay for their transport and accommodation at her parents&#8217; house. She said she paid for the schoolkids to attend the event and the fruits they were given. She was not required to attend the event, as it was not &#8220;a Zahara event&#8221;, she told the publication.
