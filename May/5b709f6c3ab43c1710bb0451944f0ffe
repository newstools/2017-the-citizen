Two former Proteas coaches will help determine who the next national coach will be. Cricket South Africa (CSA) on Thursday announced that Gary Kirsten and Eric Simons are part of a five-man panel that will &#8220;screen and recommend&#8221; the candidate. Also read: Proteas can thank Russell Domingo s fishing buddies if he stays Kirsten notably won the 2011 World Cup with India before guiding the Proteas to the top of the Test rankings during his two-year tenure. Simons was a national coach between 2002 and 2004. CSA want the candidate &#8211; whether it be current mentor Russell Domingo or someone else &#8211; to be appointed at the beginning of September. Domingo should receive a good word from Kirsten, who recommended that he replace him after serving as his deputy. Despite the process only being formalised now, there has been widespread criticism since the decision to advertise the post was announced in January. Critics believe it points to a lack of confidence in Domingo. But CSA has continually pointed out that they need to advertise the position in terms of South African labour law as Domingo has been granted too many extensions already and could lay a legal claim for a permanent position. &#8220;There has been uninformed negativity in the media about the Board s decision to start a process to recruit a coach for the Men s Senior National Team,&#8221; said CSA president Chris Nenzani. &#8220;But the reasons for our doing this were obvious and the committee we have appointed to oversee the process will make sure that we have all bases covered.&#8221; Domingo has been encouraged to re-apply for the post and, after some initial doubts, seems reasonably keen to do so. He refused to answer a question about whether next month&#8217;s ICC Champions Trophy has a bearing on the strength of his application. &#8220;That really isn&#8217;t something I can answer,&#8221; said Domingo earlier this week. &#8220;I think that&#8217;s something only the board can answer.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
