Richard Levi is recovering at home after he was struck on the head in an English county championship game for Northamptonshire on Sunday. The burly former Proteas T20 opener was wearing a helmet when the delivery from Worcestershire&#8217;s Josh Tongue hit him but he looked groggy from the outset. An ambulance had to be called and he was rushed to hospital. One reporter at the ground tweeted that Levi was &#8220;in a really bad shape&#8221;. But Northamptonshire confirmed in a statement that &#8220;precautionary tests&#8221; had been done and that he&#8217;s been diagnosed with a mild concussion. World cricket has taken blows to the head far more seriously the last few years after Australian Test player Phil Hughes was felled by a bouncer during a domestic game and died two days later. In that instance, Hughes was struck on an unprotected spot on his neck, which caused a bleed in his brain. Northamptonshire said they&#8217;d provide updates as they receive them.
