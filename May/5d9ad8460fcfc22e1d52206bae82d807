It&#8217;s beginning to sound like a broken record but the Lions and Kings dominate our team of the week. But can you blame us? They&#8217;re the only sides dishing up rugby worth watching! 15 &#8211; Warrick Gelant (Bulls) The exciting former Junior Springbok is known for his explosive attacking talents. It was great to see him being able to adapt and do that in Loftus&#8217; muddy conditions. 14 &#8211; Alshaun Bock (Kings) Three hours before kickoff in PE, the 34-year-old veteran didn&#8217;t even know he was going to play. 80 minutes later, he scored two tries and set up another in a brilliant showing. 13 &#8211; Francois Venter (Cheetahs) Another heroic effort from the skipper in a losing cause. The Bok midfielder proved a constant nuisance on attack &#8211; scoring a try &#8211; and defended well. 12 &#8211; Harold Vorster (Lions) What a strong lad this fellow is. He&#8217;s always looking to straighten the line and completed all 8 his tackles without missing one. 11 &#8211; Courtnall Skosan (Lions) He&#8217;s not just a try-scoring machine but a man willing to do the donkey work too. 10 &#8211; Lionel Cronje (Kings) On current form, he&#8217;s actually Springbok material. What a thought. 9 &#8211; Ross Cronje (Lions) He didn&#8217;t start particularly well but gradually found his composure. 8 &#8211; Warren Whiteley (Lions) This man&#8217;s work ethic is unbelievable. 13 tackles, three turnovers and magnificent captaincy under pressure. 7 &#8211; Jean-Luc du Preez (Sharks) This young man is a magnificent ball-carrier but good attacking sides do tend to target his vulnerable defending. However, the dedication can&#8217;t be faulted. 6 &#8211; Chris Cloete (Kings) His claims for higher honours can&#8217;t be ignored anymore. 5 &#8211; Franco Mostert (Lions) One of the most valuable players in this year&#8217;s tournament. He bossed the collisions, made an incredible 16 tackles and poached three vital Brumbies lineouts. 4 &#8211; Irne Herbst (Kings) He&#8217;s an underrated performer, especially as an &#8220;enforcer&#8221; doing the unfashionable work. 3 &#8211; Ruan Dreyer (Lions) He made a massive impact coming on as a replacement. The Lions scrum found an extra gear when he came on, while his defence was robust. 2 &#8211; Malcolm Marx (Lions) Flourished with Dreyer as substitute. He tackled superbly and carried with ball with vigour. 1 &#8211; Schalk van der Merwe (Kings) Finally, we see why the Lions were so sad to let him go in 2015. He scrummed like a boss against a Springbok front-row. Click here for last week&#8217;s XV. For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
