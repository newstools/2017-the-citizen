Artist Nhlanhla Dlamini has accused rapper Refiloe &#8216;Cassper Nyovest&#8217; Phoolo of stealing his song Baby Girl. Dlamini, from Tembisa, said his fans woke him up on Saturday, a day after Caspper&#8217;s album was released, and told him to listen to Baby Girl, saying it sounded &#8220;very similar&#8221; to his song. The artist told The Sowetan the song sounded like a track he had released long before. He told the publication he sent a sample of his song to the Mama I Made It hit maker last year, though his people allegedly did not acknowledge receiving his email. When he did not get their attention, he said he tagged them on links on his social media pages to listen to the song. The publication has further reported that it has seen emails sent to Cassper by Dlamini requesting that he listen to his song. It has also reportedly heard a voice note of the artist and his manager discussing the song in 2016. The rapper could not be reached for comment, while his manager told the publication he had &#8220;no comment&#8221; on the matter. Cassper Nyovest released his much-anticipated album, Thuto, which he says is his best work so far. The album has been the talk of the Twitter streets, with fans saying they do not have a favourite song as the whole album is good. Some have even asked him to shoot a music video for Baby Girl, as it is apparently &#8220;too good&#8221; not to have one. Also read: &#8216;The king is back&#8217; yamasimba, says AKA on Cassper
