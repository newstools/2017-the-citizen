Proteas skipper AB de Villiers called the toss correctly and decided to bowl first in the first ODI against England in Leeds. Sunny conditions and a good pitch prompted him to rather chase. &#8220;I&#8217;m quite comfortable with us chasing in this game,&#8221; said De Villiers in a television interview. &#8220;I think the pitch will play well for the whole 100 overs.&#8221; South Africa have continued with their approach of loading their side with all-rounders and haven&#8217;t included the extra wicket-taking option in Morne Morkel. Proteas: Hashim Amla, Quinton de Kock, Faf du Plessis, AB de Villiers (c), JP Duminy, David Miller, Chris Morris, Andile Phehlukwayo, Wayne Parnell, Kagiso Rabada, Imran Tahir.
