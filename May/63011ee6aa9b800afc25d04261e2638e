Church congregants attended Mantsoe&#8217;s second court appearance at the Johannesburg Magistrate&#8217;s Court yesterday. They had come to show support for the 27-year old father of three, who is the main suspect in the murder of his ex-girlfriend Karabo Mokoena. Speaking to News24, the congregants said people who were zealous evangelists were more susceptible to being attacked by the devil for doing the work of the Lord. &#8220;You must understand, we are living in a time where the devil is taking charge of those people who profess to be working for God, especially once you dedicate yourself too much to God. You become an enemy to the devil. This could happen to anyone, all of us were shocked,&#8221; a member was quoted as saying. Mantsoe had appeared disturbingly calm, they said, and his alleged murderous actions were shocking to those who knew him personally and his relatives. &#8220;They are crushed, they are hurt. It s painful. I don t even know where to start because, as a parent, I would never want that to happen to my child at the hands of another child. They didn&#8217;t ask for this to happen, but that&#8217;s why we want the two families to reconcile and get some closure,&#8221;said another member. The contents of Mantsoe&#8217;s and the state&#8217;s full affidavits were read out in court. However, the judge has imposed a media restriction on broadcasting and publishing the details thereof. Friends of Mantsoe who were in attendance said they knew him to be a married father of three who had since separated from his wife. They were together for two years.
