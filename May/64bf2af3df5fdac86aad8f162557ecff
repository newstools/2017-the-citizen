DA MP Marius Redelinghuys took to Facebook on Saturday morning to review the fact that his speech in the National Assembly from a year ago could just as easily be repeated again, as allegedly nothing had changed since giving the speech. He wrote that he was preparing yet another speech &#8220;during this year&#8217;s budget debate [and] I am sad, no, despondent, no, pissed off that I am addressing the same things, and that nothing has changed&#8221;. &#8220;A year ago I spoke about the war on women, the war on queer bodies, the war on the independence of state institutions, and the war raging in rural communities. &#8220;What is to be done? And who will do it? The Minister? I shudder to think.&#8221; Redelinghuys is the DA&#8217;s deputy shadow minister of police. You can watch the video he uploaded of last year&#8217;s speech below:
