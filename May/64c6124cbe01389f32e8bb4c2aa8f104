Glamorgan left-hander Colin Ingram has tipped the Proteas for ICC Champions Trophy success this summer. Ingram, who hit a career-best 142 against Essex at the weekend, turned out for South Africa when the Champions Trophy last in 2013&#8217;s edition. Russell Domingo&#8217;s side is currently the No 1 side in the world ahead of Australia.

I see it as a mini World Cup and it s a great bridge between World Cups,&#8221; said Ingram, who joined Glamorgan in 2015. &nbsp; &#8220;I rate South Africa s chances really highly. I think we ve got an organised side with some really big players. &#8220;I really like the brand of cricket they are playing at the moment, so I think they can do well.&#8221; Ingram, who averaged 32 in 31 ODIs, scored a 63-ball 73 four years ago against the West Indies in a game that helped South Africa squeeze into the semifinals. &#8220;Obviously, my international cricket days are over now, but I still follow the side closely and I would really like to see them get off the board,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Over the last couple of years, the trophy cabinet has looked a bit barren recently, so I want to see them do well and go on to win it.&#8221; South Africa&#8217;s outing in that semifinal in 2013 wasn&#8217;t a particularly nice one. England triumphed by seven wickets to book their spot in the final after the Proteas collapsed to 175 all out. Gary Kirsten, South Africa&#8217;s coach at the time, was actually the first mentor to admit afterwards that the side might have a problem with choking in big games.
