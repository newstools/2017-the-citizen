Emmanuel Macron was elected French president on Sunday in a resounding victory over far-right rival Marine Le Pen after a deeply divisive campaign, initial estimates showed. Macron, running as a centrist, won between 65.5 and 66.1 percent of the vote ahead of Le Pen on between 33.9 percent and 34.5 percent. Macron said Sunday he would &#8220;fight the divisions&#8221; in the country after a campaign that laid bare the &#8220;anger, anxiety and doubts&#8221; of many voters. &#8220;I will fight with all my strength against the divisions that are undermining us,&#8221; he said in a solemn address at his campaign headquarters. Euro rallies after Macron wins French presidency The euro rallied to $1.1010 from $1.0998 in early forex trading in Asia on Monday after pro-European centrist Emmanuel Macron won the French presidency, scoring a resounding victory over far-right rival Marine Le Pen. The 39-year-old&#8217;s victory effectively eliminates any risk of France leaving the single currency bloc, although markets had largely priced in Le Pen&#8217;s defeat after polls consistently showed Macron well in front.
