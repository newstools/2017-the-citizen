After Somizi Mhlongo poked fun at the star, the cameras zoomed in on her and showed her seated next to her kwaito Bae, Mampintsha. Babes at first admitted she was in a relationship; showing off an engagement ring then began coyly denying this was true. The Wololo hit-maker then posted on Instagram that she was single but knew exactly who she wanted. This had some people guessing that Babes was talking about her long time beau, Mampintsha again. Now we know Babes isn&#8217;t single at all, she is taken and very happy judging by the intimate way she sat with Mampintsha. Babes is up for several awards including best female artist tonight. She is going up against Amanda Black who is tipped to bag a few awards for her strong debut album Amazulu. Babes is also nominated for a BET award for best international act.
