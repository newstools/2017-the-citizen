Despite admitting that he&#8217;s had no communication with Springbok coach Allister Coetzee, Faf de Klerk maintains he isn&#8217;t leaving South African rugby over the uncertainty of his international future. The Lions on Thursday finally confirmed that the 25-year-old scrumhalf will be joining England&#8217;s Sale Sharks after this year&#8217;s Super Rugby campaign. It&#8217;s almost two weeks after Sale announced the move. De Klerk was considered Coetzee&#8217;s first choice halfback last year, appearing in 11 Tests, but hasn&#8217;t been called up for the last two national training camps. &#8220;My absence from the camps didn&#8217;t influence my decision,&#8221; said the scrumhalf, who&#8217;s rumoured to have been offered R21 million over three years. &#8220;That&#8217;s Allister and Saru&#8217;s decision. I don&#8217;t have any say in that and that&#8217;s why it didn&#8217;t influence me much.&#8221; Instead, Saru&#8217;s new rule that prevents overseas-based players for the Boks unless they have 30 or more caps was a far bigger factor in weighing his options. &#8220;I&#8217;ll admit that was a difficult one for me because it means I won&#8217;t play Test rugby for a while,&#8221; said De Klerk. &#8220;But it&#8217;s just such a great opportunity for me at this stage of my career. I can easily come back again and still be able to play in South Africa without being too old.&#8221; He chuckled when how much money he was being offered, joking &#8220;it&#8217;s not that much money&#8221;. However, Lions chief executive Rudolf Straeuli confirmed the union simply couldn&#8217;t match the offer. &#8220;It&#8217;s going to remain a problem. Overseas clubs offer, on average, three to five times more than what a player earns in South Africa,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We can&#8217;t stand in a guy&#8217;s way because it&#8217;s perfectly understandable. In Faf&#8217;s case, he followed the right channels and personally requested to be released.&#8221; Straeuli added he didn&#8217;t believe De Klerk&#8217;s current situation at the Boks was a factor. &#8220;I think there will always be speculation that the Springboks influenced his decision but that&#8217;s not the impression we got,&#8221; he said.
