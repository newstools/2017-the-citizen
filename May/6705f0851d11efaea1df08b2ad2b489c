The SA Communist Party s (SACP&#8217;s) second deputy general secretary Solly Mapaila remained defiant on Tuesday after a group of demonstrators in support of President Jacob Zuma protested outside his house with placards chanting pro-Zuma slogans and attempted to intimidate his family. Speaking to Talk Radio 702 s Redi Tlhabi, Mapaila said reporters from Gupta-owned news channel ANN7 were the first to arrive on the scene, suggesting that they had been notified of the planned protest outside his home in advance. He also thanked EFF leader Julius Malema for warning him on Monday to increase his security detail on social network site Twitter. The SACP in a statement released later Tuesday condemned the cowardly action by mischievous elements clad in MK Foundation clothes outside its deputy general secretary s house, saying it was part of Zuma s legacy . The South African Communist Party condemns in the strongest terms possible the rascal, lumpenproletariat, their handlers and funders who organised transport earlier today to the home of comrade Solly Mapaila, our second deputy general secretary, to threaten him in the name of &#8216;Hands off Zuma&#8217;. This legacy of President Jacob Zuma, the so-called defence for Zuma, is no longer merely anti-intellectual and mediocre. It has become ugly, dangerous and life-threatening, the SACP said. The party also said it had opened a case with police after the incident and will meet at the weekend to discuss further measures to be adopted in relation to Mapaila s safety as well as the safety of its entire leadership.
