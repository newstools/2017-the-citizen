The weekend is almost upon us which means excitement is reaching fever pitch as Champions Day at Turffontein Racecourse looms large. The Johannesburg track plays host to some of the brightest talents in the sport on Saturday on what is one of South African horseracing s biggest days. There s an incentive to bring friends and family for a day at the races with a R25 000 cash prize on offer for one lucky person on-course. Entry forms will be available at the gate. Added to the action on the track is the Intercontinental Village which will see racegoers able to taste their way around the world from a host of food vendors showcasing the culinary delights of a number of cultures. The day will also see the various cultures given a platform to showcase themselves on the stage with performances throughout the day. A different kind of horsepower will also be on display with an impressive collection of Ferraris on display and the chance to win a ride in one of the vehicles. One lucky person will also win an experience at the SEFAC Ferrari Day at Kyalami later this year. For the horseracing purists, the chance to see the likes of Legal Eagle, the highest-rated horse in the country, as he looks to defend his crown in the R4-million Premier s Champions Challenge is a definite highlight. The reigning Horse of the Year meets eight challengers including Nother Russia, recent winner of the Princess Charlene of Monaco Empress Club Stakes (Gr 1). Tickets for Champions Day, which features the Intercontinental Village, are available at Webtickets or at the gate on the day.
