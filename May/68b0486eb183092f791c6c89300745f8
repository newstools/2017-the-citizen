While chatting to the audience at his album listening session, Cassper spoke about seeing someone snort drugs right in front of him for the first time. It happened in Mahikeng, and he was pushed to make a career of his success so he could change the dreams of the young people back home. &#8220;I think I&#8217;ve identified my job, and it is to inspire people and teach them. I&#8217;ve taken my career and put myself on the line. When I did Orlando stadium, Riky&#8217;s wife came up to me and she said yo, why do you do this to yourself. &#8220;I thought about it, and I have to. If I don&#8217;t do it who is going to do it? I have to go through the front and break those walls and have people criticise and laugh at me &#8230; When I go back to my hood I see seven-year-olds smoking weed. I saw a fourteen-year old taking coke. &#8220;The first time I saw cocaine, I was 16-years old. It was the scariest thing I&#8217;ve ever experienced in my life. I thought that it was so possible for that coke to fly into my nose. I&#8217;m chilling there asking the guys: &#8216;So you are smoking this thing?&#8217; I had never seen anything like that in my whole life.&#8221; Cassper concluded by saying he saw firsthand how the youth did not have anything to aspire to, which is why he has taken it upon himself to uplift them.
