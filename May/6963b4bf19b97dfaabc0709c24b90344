Stormers coach Robbie Fleck insists his team won&#8217;t suddenly become conservative after three consecutive Super Rugby defeats. It&#8217;s been a tough few weeks for the Capetonians, who have conceded 143 points in those three games and are suddenly now off the pace on the overall log. Previously &#8211; especially under now Springbok coach Allister Coetzee &#8211; the Stormers&#8217; would&#8217;ve crept into their shells in order to try and minimise the damage. Also read: The Kings gems shine in our Super Rugby XV for the week Given that they play the Hurricanes in Wellington on Friday, the prospect of a full-house of losses on their tour is real. But the Stormers will stick to their new direction. &#8220;Our approach will be the same,&#8221; said Fleck. &#8220;We haven&#8217;t suddenly bottled up. It&#8217;s true that in years past we became conservative when we took a few hammerings. &#8220;But we&#8217;re not going to change now, we&#8217;re still going to play rugby. There&#8217;s still no better way to develop than in New Zealand&#8217;s own backyard.&#8221; Despite a six-match unbeaten start to the campaign, the Stormers mentor isn&#8217;t afraid to admit it might&#8217;ve proved misleading. &#8220;It&#8217;s not as if we haven&#8217;t made mistakes in games previously,&#8221; said Fleck. &#8220;It&#8217;s just that earlier in the season, we were able to cover for those mistakes. Maybe the opposition simply wasn&#8217;t good enough to take advantage. &#8220;But in New Zealand, against quality opposition, it&#8217;s brutal. Our decision-making is hurting us and in both our games here to date, we&#8217;ve been done by half-time.&#8221; It&#8217;s all been quite hard on an emerging group of players, of whom 13 are first-time rugby tourists. &#8220;The big challenge this week has been mental,&#8221; said Fleck. &#8220;Naturally, we&#8217;ve had to worry a bit about the players&#8217; emotional state. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;ve tried to keep our feedback as constructive as possible. &#8220;The players are disappointed but there&#8217;s no point in dwelling on the past two weeks.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
