A car driver died and three other people were injured when their car veered off the N3 and crashed into a concrete wall near Old Dutch Road in central Durban on Sunday, KwaZulu-Natal paramedics said. Rescue Care paramedics responded to the crash shortly after 11.30am, Rescue Care spokesman Garrith Jamieson said. On their arrival they found that a car had left the N3 freeway and collided with a concrete wall. On their assessment it was found that the driver, a man believed to be in his 30s, had sustained major injuries and had died before paramedics arrival. He was declared dead on the scene. Three passengers were stabilised on the scene before being transported to a nearby hospital for the further care that they required. The cause of the crash was not yet known, Jamieson said.
