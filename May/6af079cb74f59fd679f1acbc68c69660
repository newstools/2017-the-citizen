The Nigerian Prisons Service has recaptured a death row inmate more than five years after her escape. The condemned prisoner, Rabi Ismail, escaped from custody in Hadejia prison in the northwestern Kano State in December 2011. A High Court in Kano had sentenced Ismail to death by hanging for culpable homicide in 2005. She was subsequently held in Kaduna Central prison from where she was transferred to Hadejia before she escaped. Prisons spokesperson Francis Enobore appealed to members of the public to continue providing useful information on escapees and any criminal element to security agents. He assured that security measures had been strengthened to prevent prisoners from escaping. Furthermore, escapees still at large will be fished out of their hiding no matter how long it takes to do so, Enobore said.
