The rape and murder of the little girl shocked South Africa, with President Jacob Zuma, Police Minister Fikile Mbalula, and Western Cape community safety MEC Dan Plato all taking turns to visit the family this past week. Zuma had also visited the site in nearby Epping where Courtney s body was discovered last Saturday, nine days after she went missing. http://ana-baobab-prod-eu-west-2.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ana/media/video/2017/05/20/33683978WhatsAppVideo20170520at07360.webm A 40-year-old man who lived with the Pieters family appeared in the Goodwood Magistrate s Court on Wednesday charged with Courtney s rape and murder. In a statement issued by the presidency earlier this week, Zuma expressed shock and repulsion at Courtney s murder and other similar cases around the country where women and children had been violently attacked. Our prayers and thoughts are with the families during this difficult period. The incidents have caused untold pain among South Africans and this is the time for us to unite and isolate these cruel perpetrators of this shameful and hateful crime against women and children, Zuma said at the time. Courtney was buried at the Modderdam Road cemetery in Belhar.
