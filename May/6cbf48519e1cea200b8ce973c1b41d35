A 46-year-old man was found dead near his crashed car alongside the N14 near the Petroport in Nooitgedacht, north of Johannesburg early on Sunday morning, paramedics said. An ER24 medic on her way to work at about 5.30am noticed the car on the side of the road, ER24 spokesperson Werner Vermaak said. She called for assistance and pulled over to see if she could help. A security vehicle and a police vehicle also noticed the incident and pulled over shortly after her. Upon assessment they found that the 46-year-old man, believed to be the driver of the vehicle, was ejected and lying in the grass next to the highway. He had fatal injuries and there was nothing that could be done for him. He was declared dead, Vermaak said. African News Agency (ANA)
