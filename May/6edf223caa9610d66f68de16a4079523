South Africans are invited to take part in the consultations around the Anti-Corruption Discussion Document Strategy, which was launched in Pretoria yesterday by Minister in the Presidency for Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation Jeff Radebe. Radebe said there was scepticism and widespread negative perceptions of government s effort to fight corruption. In our view, there is no basis for this negativity if we consider the numerous initiatives that we have set in motion, as well as the more modest successes we have recorded in the course of wrestling the corruption beast. The National Anti-Corruption Strategy originated from the Medium-Term Strategic Framework, which prioritised the review of the Anti-Corruption Policy framework to develop a strategy that takes into account all existing institutional structures and initiatives fighting corruption. A diagnostic report on corruption was commissioned thereafter to identify the main challenges and inform the focus points of the strategy, Radebe said. The launch of the discussion document was aimed at kick-starting a wider consultation process. Radebe said government had made progress in the fight against corruption, with 66 people being convicted for high-priority matters since 2014. In the current term of the fifth administration, government has set the goal to secure the conviction of a collective of 120 people involved in high-priority corruption cases by 2019. Radebe said these cases involved R5 million and above. For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
