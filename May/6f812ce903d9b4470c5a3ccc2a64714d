Newly-crowned SA champions in the men s 100m and women s 800m, Akani Simbine and Caster Semenya will kick off their international season in Doha on Friday, the first stop of the 2017 Diamond League Series. Participation in the meetings is by invitation only, ensuring that only the cream of the crop of athletes contest the series which rewards winners of each event with the iconic diamond trophy and about R700 000 in prize money. Each one of the thirty-two disciplines (16 for both male and females) is staged a total of seven times during the season. The top six athletes at each meeting are awarded points. The top eight or 12 athletes in the overall standings progress to the Finals in either Zurich or Brussels, depending on their discipline. That means that, at each of the Finals, the fields will be packed exclusively with athletes who have performed consistently over the entire season. On Friday Simbine will line up against the likes of Justin Gatlin, Asafa Powel and Olympic bronze medalist, Andre de Grasse. Semenya is the 2016 Diamond League winner in the 800m and starts her title defence against a strong field featuring Olympics silver and bronze medalists, Francine Niyonsaba and Margaret Wambui. The trio will meet again later this month in Eugene. Other South Africans who ve been confirmed so far to compete at this year s series meetings include long jumper Luvo Manyonga, who ll be making his debut in Shanghai, sprinter Wenda Nel and javelin queen Sunette Viljoen.
