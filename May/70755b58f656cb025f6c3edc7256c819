Johannesburg s Metrobus acting managing director has reportedly been suspended with immediate effect in a probe involving millions of rands paid to contractors; the state has asked for the conviction of a former group executive at the South African Revenue Service (Sars) on charges ranging from fraud to money laundering; and the DA-led Tshwane council have appointed an independent audit to assess the rate at which its ANC predecessors agreed to pay off a controversial smart metering contractor, PEU Capital Partners. And this was just in one day. In Johannesburg, Sabata Makoele faces allegations of financial misconduct following forensic investigations into what is understood to be millions of rands he authorised as acting chief financial officer of the bus company which transports 95 000 commuters daily. The prospect of criminal charges against Makoele have not been ruled out. The state brought 43 witnesses to testify against former Sars official Mandisa Mokwena and her co-accused including Sars cost centre manager Leslie Moonsamy a number of academics and business acquaintances on 50 charges of racketeering, money laundering and fraud involving R11 million. They have entered not guilty pleas. In Tshwane, the smart metering contract with PEU came at a cost of R30 million a year, an expense mayor Solly Msimanga said threatened to bankrupt the city. In terms of an interim court order, the city has continued to pay 9.5 cents per kWh, down from the 19.5c/kWh the previous administration had agreed with PEU. None of these cases have been finalised, but it makes you think someone, somewhere, must have figured out that there will come a time when the money runs out and the lids of the leaky coffers slam shut on greedy fingers.
