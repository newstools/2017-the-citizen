Faf de Klerk has also decided to ditch South African rugby. English club Sale Sharks on Monday morning announced on their website that the nippy Springbok and Lions scrumhalf has signed a three-year deal worth a reputed R21 million. Given that the South African Rugby Union (Saru) recently changed its policy for overseas-based Springboks, De Klerk won&#8217;t be available for the national side until 2019&#8217;s World Cup because he hasn&#8217;t played more than 30 Tests. The 25-year-old made his international debut last year and appeared in 11 matches. &#8220;I am made up that Faf has decided to join us next season,&#8221; Steve Diamond, Sale&#8217;s director of rugby, said in a statement. &#8220;He is tenacious with a fantastic work rate &#8211; he dictates the tempo and direction of the game and I think he will fit in well both with our style of play, and with a young, ambitious squad. &#8221; The Lions last month insisted that De Klerk would honour his contract at the Lions, which only expires at the end of the 2018 season. Rudolf Straeuli, the union&#8217;s chief executive, confirmed negotiations are ongoing with regards to a transfer fee. &#8220;Negotiations are under way and I have not signed anything regarding the offer to Faf. Die team is focused on their third game on tour (against the Brumbies on Friday) and an official announcement will only be made once they are back,&#8221; he said. Some critics believe the attacking halfback doesn&#8217;t yet possess the all-round skills to be consistent in heavier European conditions but that&#8217;s hardly troubled Sale. &#8220;Faf&#8217;s an unbelievable ball carrier, has a solid kicking game and he is exciting around the pitch. He sees the weakness in his opposition and can leverage this to his advantage. He&#8217;s young but has massive experience and this will be crucial in helping us to build on the foundations we have put in place this year,&#8221; said Diamond. De Klerk wasn&#8217;t included in Bok coach Allister Coetzee&#8217;s latest national training squad and has also been rotated with fellow teammates Ross Cronje and Dillon Smit.
