When Elton Jantjies dazzled in last year&#8217;s Super Rugby campaign, many felt he was finally ready to be a Springbok again. That proved a false dawn. In 2017, he&#8217;s been less exciting but more steady.

Being a pivot in Test rugby is not about the fancy stuff like long passes or cheeky cross kicks. It&#8217;s about doing the basics well and that&#8217;s exactly what Jantjies has done. &#8220;We&#8217;re very happy with the way Elton&#8217;s season is going,&#8221; said Lions coach Johan Ackermann ahead of Saturday&#8217;s meeting with the Rebels. &#8220;He&#8217;s grown a lot as a player in the past few months. He&#8217;s a match-winner in his own right and will always give his best.&#8221; Perhaps the best indication of Jantjies&#8217; willingness to work hard has been the improvement in his goal-kicking. It was one of his bigger weaknesses last year but in 2017 he boasts a fine 82% success rate at goal. &#8220;There were a number of games in which his kicks were crucial to keep us ahead and put pressure on the opposition,&#8221; said Ackermann. &#8220;Naturally there are always aspects that Elton can still work on, be it a better kick to touch or a better tactical kick. But his discipline is superb. He is the guy who always, after practice, stays on to do some extra kicking practice.&#8221; As Jantjies &#8211; with almost eerie calmness &#8211; ghosted through a gap to score the Lions&#8217; bonus point try against the Force last week, another doubt about his game was relieved to an extent. The 26-year-old showed he can stay calm under pressure. In fact, that started at Newlands against the Stormers three weeks ago where he kicked superbly and made good decisions. Even his much-criticised defence has been better this season. &#8220;I feel he&#8217;s always had that calmness about him. I know there are people who are of the opinion that he &#8216;disappears&#8217; in the big games but we certainly have never doubted him,&#8221; said Ackermann. Given his showings, Jantjies at least deserves one more chance against France in June to show if he might make the grade as an Springbok flyhalf.
