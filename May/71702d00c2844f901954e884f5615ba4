Sushi King and businessman Kenny Kunene and his wife, Whitney, welcomed their baby boy at the Morningside Medi Clinic on Sunday. They couple have named their baby Remo Mokgethwa, a Sotho name meaning &#8216;the chosen one&#8217;. Kunene told Weekly Xpos though circumstances had in the past deprived him of being part of his three&#8217;s children births and infancy, the birth of his son gave him an &#8220;excellent&#8221; opportunity to correct this. &#8220;It&#8217;s an opportunity I have grabbed with both hands,&#8221; he was quoted as saying. After the birth of his son, Kunene said the happiness he had could &#8220;easily kill&#8221; his haters. Baby Remo has an Instagram account and already has more than 1 400 followers with the bio: &#8220;Official Page of Whitney n @Kenny_Kunene son, Remo Kunene. To be da most fashionable n spoilt baby. Success n Great things await me [sic].&#8221; Kunene tied the knot with his long-time girlfriend Nonkululeko Whitney Mhlanga in a traditional ceremony held in Kimberley in March. Kenny, 46, met the 22-year-old Mhlanga four years ago and knew instantly that she was the one, though he had doubts about the age gap between them. But it was Mhlanga s maturity that made him realise age would not be a problem. Kenny would have married Mhlanga two years ago had she not insisted on finishing her studies first. The couple is yet to have a white wedding. &nbsp; Kunene tied the knot with his long-time girlfriend Nonkululeko Whitney Mhlanga in a traditional ceremony held in Kimberley in March.
