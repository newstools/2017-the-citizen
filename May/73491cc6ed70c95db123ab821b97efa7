South African-born comedian Trevor Noah continues to fly the country&#8217;s flag high. Barely two years after filling in the shoes of Jon Stewart as the host of the American talk show The Daily Show, Trevor beat Ellen DeGeneres, John Oliver, RuPaul and Samantha Bee to win Best Host at the MTV Movie &amp; TV Awards. &#8220;There is one person I aspire to be every single day, and that is my mom: a powerful, strong black woman who never listened when people told her she couldn&#8217;t be more,&#8221; said Noah. &nbsp; Backstage after winning MTV award for best host.
