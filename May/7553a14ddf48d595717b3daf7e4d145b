Actor Nomzamo Mbatha recently attended the NutriDay Break Party and as usual, made sure to share pictures and videos of the event. However, things got weird after posting a picture of herself in a blue and white floral dress that somehow made her look like she was pregnant. Obviously, fans noticed and rumours about her pregnancy were sparked, despite her posting pictures of herself at the beach, with her flat tummy. The comments even grabbed her boyfriend, Maps Maponyane&#8217;s attention and he responded. &#8220;Not mine,&#8221; he told his girlfriend, who later told him she hated him for adding fuel to the fire. Maponyane&#8217;s comment served as a confirmation to many that Nomzamo was not pregnant, taht it was just her dress that made her look pregnant. The two have been dating for a while now, though they only recently came out in an interview with DJ Sbu on Vuma FM. Asked if Mbatha makes him happy, he responded with 100% , also emphasising that the two were bests of friends. We have a super supportive relationship where we re both hustling and pushing and setting things up and we re literally best friends, he said. Maps said he did not see any problem calling his girlfriend buddy because they actually are best friends who support each other and share too much information sometimes, according to a birthday message he once wrote for her.
