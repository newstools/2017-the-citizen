S&#8217;bu Nkosi has an interesting role model. In fact, he&#8217;s not even a rugby union player. &#8220;It might sound weird but (New Zealand rugby league star) Shaun Johnson is one of my heroes,&#8221; said the 21-year-old Sharks winger, who&#8217;s already taken Super Rugby by the scruff of the neck. &#8220;I think I&#8217;ve literally watched every video he&#8217;s posted on Youtube. He has stepping tutorials that helps you evade opponents on the attack. I&#8217;d watch his games just to sidestep like him one day.&#8221; Also read: The hits and misses of the Springbok squad Those skills came in handy when the former Junior Springbok made his debut for the Sharks against the Force three weeks ago. Nkosi actually scored a try that was disallowed due to a forward pass but his pace and stepping was there for all to see. &#8220;My debut was a very eventful game,&#8221; he said with a chuckle. &#8220;I first took a knock to the head and had to go off for a concussion test. I was nervous in the doctor&#8217;s room. When I came out again, the Force scored a try and I suddenly felt even more so.&#8221; But channeled those feelings well. &#8220;We broke the line and I was one-on-one with the Force&#8217;s fullback,&#8221; said Nkosi. &#8220;I looked for someone on the outside but there was no-one. I was thinking: &#8216;Gosh, the world is forcing me to do this on my own&#8217;. So I tried to step him and saw the open tryline. It was a delightful feeling, even if it wasn&#8217;t a legitimate try.&#8221; Last weekend, however, he was duly rewarded for his efforts, which includes some very good defence. Nkosi scored two tries in the 38-17 win over the Sunwolves and did so alongside two of his other idols &#8211; Lwazi Mvovo (a hat-trick hero) and veteran Odwa Ndungane. &#8220;I remember watching Odwa when I was still in grade two,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But I&#8217;ve also taken great inspiration from Lwazi. I&#8217;ve modelled a lot of my game on him.&#8221; Nkosi admits he&#8217;s had a great introduction to Super Rugby but he&#8217;s also grateful that coach Robert du Preez didn&#8217;t rush him into action. &#8220;I think it was a good move. As a youngster, I needed to be exposed to the intensity and concentration levels required at this level,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It was the best thing the coach could&#8217;ve done for me.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
