Businessman Kenny Kunene shared his thoughts on KwaZulu-Natal DA caucus spokesperson and MPL Mbali Ntuli&#8217;s charges after liking a Facebook post in December last year proclaiming that Helen Zille is a racist . On Monday night, Kunene took to Twitter to explain what he thought was happening in the party, also referring to the pornographic satire painting of naked Selfe, Maimane and Zille, which Kunene bought last year and says he displays in his bedroom. &#8220;I see James Selfe has overruled Maimane on the Mbali Ntuli matter. This artwork [referring to the painting] is vindicated. Master and slave/puppet scenario,&#8221; said Kunene. Responding to Kunene, comedian Loyiso Gola said the sushi king was using the term artwork &#8220;loosely&#8221;, a comment that probably left him wishing he should have just kept quiet. &#8220;Please go make dry jokes to your white masters,&#8221; was Kunene&#8217;s response. But Kunene is now left with the problem of having to name the masters he speaks of, as Gola told him &#8220;names are preferable&#8221;. Ntuli&#8217;s charges received criticism from the public, who questioned why Ntuli was charged before Western Cape Premier Helen Zille, who is yet to be charged for her comments on colonialism. Explaining why Ntuli was charged before Zille, chairperson of the party s federal council James Selfe said Ntuli s investigation was concluded much earlier than Helen Zille s one, which explained why the decision to charge her was made before Zille s colonialism rants. Ntuli was charged despite the legal commission s advice to the federal council that it not charge Ntuli over the incident. In a conversation with Justice Malala of eNCA s Justice Factor last week, party leader Mmusi Maimane said if called upon to be a witness for Ntuli during the disciplinary hearing, he would do so. Maimane did not believe he was contradicting federal council decision to charge Ntuli in a matter that seems to be likely to divide the party as the two leaders stood on opposite sides.
