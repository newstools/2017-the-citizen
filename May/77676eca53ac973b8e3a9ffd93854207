In perhaps one of the most bizarre cases ever reported, a man from Austin, Texas, sued his date for about R229, saying she gave him a &#8220;date from hell&#8221;. Brandon Vezmar, 37, sued his date last week because she was texting instead of watching Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2 with him at the cinema. Vezmar&#8217;s date reportedly took out her phone and started texting about 15 minutes into the movie. Now he wants to be compensated for the cost of the movie ticket, reports The Daily Mail. The man reportedly said texting during a movie was a &#8220;direct violation&#8221; of the policy at the cinema and that it &#8220;adversely&#8221; affected his experience. The website further reports Vezmar said it was the first date from hell, as texting was one of his biggest pet peeves. In the lawsuit, Vezmar reportedly said he asked his date to stop texting or go outside. The date reportedly left the cinema and drove away, leaving the poor guy without transport to go home. The woman, who reportedly refused to be named, only found out about the claim against her when she received a phone call on Tuesday. In her defence, she reportedly said she was texting a friend who was having a fight with her boyfriend. She denied that it was constant texting. She has further refused to pay him back as he took her out on a date, not the other way round. She told the website she would also file a protective order against Vezmar, as he allegedly tried contacting her younger sister demanding the money owed to him. &nbsp;
