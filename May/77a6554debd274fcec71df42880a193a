If there is one thing that has become clear about Cassper, it&#8217;s that he doesn&#8217;t have to really try hard to find a girlfriend. The star is single again, and looking for a new bae. While he was linked to Thobeka Majozi a few weeks ago after they were spotted together at his album release party in Soweto, Cassper has shut that down, taking to Twitter to share some racy pics of himself. His female fans fell for it, and Cassper indulged them, flirting and tweeting back. But he was never ready for some of the responses he was about to get. Twitter user @YumzSithole took flirting a little too far by sharing what her ultimate fantasy was with the star. The memes that were generated from the tweet were too lit! &nbsp; Cassper be like pic.twitter.com/ipfJvRZLMs &mdash; Mac.
