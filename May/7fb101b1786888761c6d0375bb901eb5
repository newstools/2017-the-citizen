According to the scathing report compiled by academics and released yesterday, the controversial appointment of former home affairs minister Malusi Gigaba to the finance ministry was a continuation of the Gutpas positioning themselves as &#8220;key strategic brokers&#8221;. &#8220;It is now clear that while the ideological focus of the ANC is &#8216;radical economic transformation&#8217;, in practice, Jacob Zuma&#8217;s presidency is aimed at repurposing state institutions to consolidate the Zuma-centred power elite,&#8221; the report states in its executive summary. &#8220;The appointment of Malusi Gigaba as minister of public enterprises marked the start of the systemic reconfiguring of the SOE [state-owned enterprises] boards,&#8221; it states. The report details the genesis of state capture via Gigaba through his appointment of department of trade and industry senior official Iqbal Sharma to the board of Transnet. This was followed by the New Age, a Gupta-owned newspaper, reporting in December 2010 that Brian Molefe would become Transnet CEO.

At Transnet, Gigaba &#8220;tries to make [Iqbal] Sharma board chair, but Cabinet veto&#8217;s reportedly based on his proximity to the Gupta family&#8221;, it is explained. &#8220;Transnet then creates the Board Acquisitions and Disposals committee to supervise the planned pipeline of future large-scale infrastructure spending tenders worth more than R2.5 billion,&#8221; and &#8220;Sharma is appointed to chair this committee,&#8221; the report emphasises.
