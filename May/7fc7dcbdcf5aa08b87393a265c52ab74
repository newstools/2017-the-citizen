The boss noticed the armed robbers who shot the actor had stolen his shoes, and got upset. &#8220;When I arrived, I found his motionless body lying outside the venue. There was another body inside [the lounge]. Apparently, there was an attempted robbery of some ladies who were leaving the pub,&#8221; said Mhlongo.
