His case was postponed to July 31 for further investigation. He is facing a charge of murder. He is accused of killing Nombuyiselo Nombewu at Jouberton Extension 7 near Klerksdorp and burning her body. She was last seen on May 12, when her grandmother sent her to one of the neighbours.

Manyiki was later arrested on the same day. Angry residents, mostly women, packed the courtroom, while some stood on court benches to have a glimpse of Manyiki. They later chanted outside court, rejoicing that he did not apply for bail. We say no bail to this one! read one of the placards.
