Guizhou Zhicheng&#8217;s head coach Li Bing has accused the muscular Brazilian of punching his assistant coach Yu Ming at half-time during SIPG&#8217;s 3-0 victory on Saturday. But Hulk, one of a number of highly paid foreign stars in the cash-rich Super League, denied any violent behaviour. SIPG has also said the incident &#8220;did not occur&#8221;. &#8220;Unfortunately they are trying to abuse my image,&#8221; Hulk wrote in English on the Chinese microblogging website, Weibo, late Sunday. &#8220;The coach of the adversary team is accusing me of aggression. Where did he see it? I didn&#8217;t behave violently in any way! &#8220;I have my conscience clear. God knows it. I just want to do what I love most &#8212; (which) is to play football! I&#8217;m very happy in China. I like and respect all of the Chinese people.&#8221; Hulk, who signed from Zenit St Petersburg for 55 million euros last June, has been SIPG&#8217;s top-scorer this season with eight goals in all competitions for Andre Villas-Boas&#8217;s side. Guizhou&#8217;s Li first raised the allegations of a racist attack on Yu at Saturday&#8217;s post-match press conference, and then made further claims on social media. &#8220;Foreign players are here to improve our football level. Hulk has strong skills, but he cannot be here and despise Chinese people,&#8221; he told journalists. Li later posted on social media that Hulk &#8220;suddenly brought his fist out at Yu Ming&#8217;s forehead and knocked him to the ground&#8221;. But SIPG said there was no security camera footage of the altercation, and accused Li and Yu of making &#8220;inappropriate statements&#8230; provoking hostility between foreign and Chinese players&#8221;. Guizhou Zhicheng later posted that &#8220;the evidence is still unclear&#8221; and appealed to both sides to &#8220;look at the big picture&#8221; of developing Chinese football.
