South African broadcaster Naspers is in talks with MTN Group to supply pay-TV content to the mobile operator&#8217;s subscribers, Naspers said on Monday. &#8220;We are in discussions with MTN regarding a content supply agreement,&#8221; Naspers spokeswoman Meloy Horn said in an email. If agreed, the deal could boost returns for Naspers&#8217; pay-TV unit, which is grappling with rising costs and currency swings. Horn declined to comment on speculation Naspers was considering the sale of its pay-TV operations outside South Africa. For MTN, a deal would be a major step forward in the strategy of new chief executive Rob Shuter to convince some of its more than 220 million subscribers to use their phones for everything from paying bills to streaming live football matches. MTN was not immediately available to comment.
