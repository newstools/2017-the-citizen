One person died, in hospital afterwards, and 19 others were injured when two minibus taxis collided on the Richmond Road near the M13 bridge in Pinetown in Durban on Saturday, paramedics said. Rescue Care paramedics arrived on the scene and found that two taxis had been involved in the collision. Multiple patients had been ejected from the one vehicle as it rolled several times coming to a stop on its side, Rescue Care spokesman Garrith Jamieson said. Immediately more ambulances were dispatched to the scene. One person had sustained critical injuries and was stabilised on the scene and placed on a manual ventilator before being rushed through to a specialist hospital for urgent care that he required. Unfortunately his injuries were too severe and he passed away in hospital a short while later. A further 19 people sustained various injuries ranging from minor to serious and were all stabilised on the scene before being transported by various ambulances to various Durban hospitals for the further care that they required. At this stage the cause of the collision was unknown, Jamieson said. African News Agency (ANA) For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
