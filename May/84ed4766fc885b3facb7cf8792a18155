Six South African telecom companies, including MTN Group and Vodacom, will be able to keep their in-demand broadband spectrum until their licences expire in 2028 after agreeing to buy at least 30 percent of the government&#8217;s new Wireless Open Access Network, the communications minister said on Thursday. Minister Siyabonga Cwele told journalists an agreement was reached with operators on May 19, after they initially opposed a government plan forcing them to ditch their broadband spectrum and share a national network. Creating a single open-access network is at the heart of a government goal to roll out broadband access in Africa&#8217;s most industrialised economy.
