The Democratic Alliance has welcomed the progress report given on Sunday by Gauteng health MEC Gwen Ramokgopa on the relocation of former Life Esidimeni mental health patients from unsuitable NGOs to facilities where they will receive good care. According to Ramokgopa, 91 percent of eligible patients have been relocated from NGOs, with 750 patients sent to Clinix Selby Park (390), Baneng (232), and Waverley Care Centre (128), DA MPL and spokesman Jack Bloom said. Twenty NGOs had been closed and the remaining 67 patients were at nine NGOs where families and patients had resisted their transfer or legal action had been taken by the NGO, he said. The non-negotiable issue is that all NGOs with mental health patients must be properly licensed. If patients and their families are happy and if the NGOs can prove that they meet the licensing standard then they should be allowed to keep the patients. The partnership model with NGOs should continue provided there is proper monitoring to ensure that standards are maintained. I hope that the department listens to the wishes of patients and families to resolve this issue in an amicable manner. The whole Esidimeni debacle arose from arrogant top-down decision-making which should give way to a more consultative and inclusive approach, Bloom said. According to media reports, Ramokgopa briefed members of the media at the health department s offices in Johannesburg on Sunday giving a status update since the health ombudsman s report. The first relocations following the report began in March this year. Over 100 patients reportedly died from neglect and a lack of food, among others, between March and December last year in Gauteng after the department moved about 1600 patients from Life Esidimeni Mental Health facilities to NGOs in a bid to cut costs.
