The awards ceremony took place on May 27 at the Sun City Super Bowl, and saw the top names in the South African music and entertainment industry all under one roof. If you didn t watch the show everyone is talking about, then grab a cup of coffee, sit back and indulge, as we lay down our Top 5 moments of the night. 1. Somizi and Tumi We had predicted that these two would be the most amazing hosts in the history of the SAMAs, and they proved us right! @tumi_morake you and Somizi were the highlight of the night!!! Wow. Sooo damn entertaining. Thank you. #SAMA23 &mdash; Bonang B* Matheba (@bonang_m) May 27, 2017 We can definitely say that these two have earned the nation s respect and are now UP there. 2. Commercial breaks? Not live! If you thought that everything stops during commercial breaks then you haven t been to a show hosted by Somizi! He kept audiences entertained during commercials and had them jamming to old struggle songs. Most definitely the ad breaks were more lit than the actual show! Surely you&#39;d agree @bonang_m lol #SAMA23 pic.twitter.com/HRAoDtNlsL &mdash; Nhlanhla Mthimkhulu (@nhlanhlazmyname) May 28, 2017 3. Kwesta Can we get a #HuuuSham for this one? The heavens finally answered our prayers and blessed our fave @KwestaDaKAR with 6 awards, including Best Male Artist of the Year and Best Album of the Year, following his #4millionviews4ngud milestone. We can soundly say that its Kwestas time and he is finally getting the recognition he deserves. This had fans all over the country congratulating the artist. &nbsp; It took over ten years for the country to see what @smegaforever and I saw in you, most importantly u a star because you saw it in yourself even when we were out the picture. It&#8217;s always love @kwestadakar u make me proud. This is for everything you&#8217;ve achieved including last night. You a real champ.

Memes By now we all know that our celebrities go on the red carpet knowing that they are going to be roasted for either what they are wearing or what they are going to say. The response on social media came as no surprise as everyone, including Somizi, was made fun of. 5. Babes Wodumo Babes Wodumo had announced to her fans that if she doesn t win any award at the #SAMA23, awards shows can miss her.
