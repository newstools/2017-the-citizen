South Africa s premier fast bowler Dale Steyn says he is not quite ready to bowl yet. As a result, he&#8217;s withdrawn from the SA A team s tour of England starting in two weeks time, meaning his return to international cricket won t come before the Proteas Test series in the United Kingdom.

Cricket South Africa, naturally, insisted that the 33-year-old quick first show some match fitness before he returns to the national setup. Given the lack of time, Steyn decided not to rush things. It wasn t just a matter of the little broken bone in the shoulder joint, I also tore my bicep and other tendons in the shoulder. It was a very unusual injury and bowling is a very unusual thing to be doing, so I have to make sure I ve totally completed my rehab. Even if takes six more months to be ready, I just have to make sure I m ready to go when I return to the field, Steyn said yesterday. Although the delay is a blow to South Africa s hopes of having Steyn back to lead the attack in the four Tests against England in July and August, it is hoped he will be able to play in the home Tests against Bangladesh in September/October.
