Kings coach Deon Davids&#8217; plea for his side to be allowed to maintain some continuity is falling on deaf ears. In fact, it seems the Eastern Cape franchise&#8217;s expulsion from Super Rugby is a done deal. Also read: Nutshell: Hat-trick hero Lwazi Mvovo leads Sharks to win The Sharks on Monday announced the signing of two influential performers for the Kings this season. Most prominently is scrumhalf Louis Schreuder, who has looked a player transformed since he was signed earlier this year. The 27-year-old haflback, unexpectedly picked for the Springboks&#8217; year-end tour to Europe in 2013, was criticised in his last two years with the Stormers for his somewhat stale play. He departed after last year&#8217;s Super Rugby campaign to play in Japan for Kubota Spears and there were doubts over the Kings&#8217; wisdom to sign him. But Schreuder has made that seem silly. &#8220;Louis brings with him a wealth of experience,&#8221; said Sharks coach Robert du Preez. &#8220;With (Springbok scrumhalf) Cobus Reinach departing for Northampton later this year, Louis and Michael Claassens will shepherd the scrumhalf responsibilities and provide the necessary mentorship and guidance to our emerging scrumhalves at the franchise.&#8221; Another intriguing recruit is the blinside flanker Tyler Paul. The 22-year-old has now established himself as the first-choice No 7 at the Kings and is a particularly eager defender. He is one of the players who have made created the most turnovers from their tackles. &#8220;His work ethic and drive makes him a perfect fit for our team. We are confident that his move to Durban will prove to be beneficial for both the player s personal development and for our team,&#8221; said Du Preez. The Kings have already lost backline stars Malcolm Jaer and Makazole Mapimpi to the Cheetahs, while captains Lionel Cronje and Schalk Ferreira are also leaving. Complicating the Kings&#8217; contracting is the fact that Saru bankrolls the franchise. It means every player is only contracted for a year due to monetary constraints.
