Perhaps it&#8217;s just the stage of his career or a favourable exchange rate but Francois Uys&#8217; departure from the Cheetahs raises one pertinent question. And it&#8217;s also an obvious one: is the 31-year-old lock perhaps aware of the franchise&#8217;s Super Rugby future? Also read: The Kings gems shine in our Super Rugby XV for the week The Cheetahs are thought to be one of the two local teams to be cut from the tournament from 2018 onwards. Uys on Wednesday confirmed to OFM that he&#8217;ll be moving to France at the end of the current campaign to represent Grenoble. He cited &#8220;family responsibilities&#8221; as his main motivation for making the move and not the uncertainty surrounding the team. In fact, the stalwart &#8211; who grew up on the East Rand &#8211; believes there&#8217;s no reason for his teammates to jump ship just because Super Rugby might be off the table. I still believe that even if a guy decides to stay in South Africa it s not all doom-and-gloom. There are a lot of opportunities,&#8221; said Uys. &#8220;Even if the Cheetahs don t make the Super Rugby for next season, I think a lot of positives could come out of it. There will definitely be a way the team will be accommodated in the Pro12 or in Europe somewhere. &#8220;I just cannot see them letting go of a big and proud union or franchise like the Cheetahs. Maybe it s a blessing in disguise.&#8221; Uys probably didn&#8217;t see himself playing a part of that potential brave new future. The emergence of several younger locks such as Justin Basson, Reniel Hugo and Dennis Visser has seen his playing opportunities shrink. He is, though, in the starting line-up for Friday evening&#8217;s meeting with the Highlanders in Bloemfontein. &#8220;The one thing that I am quite sad about is not being able to represent the Cheetahs in a 100 Super Rugby games,&#8221; said Uys, who has made 77 appearances. &#8220;In saying that we as family believe that this is best time for us to move along and see where our new adventure takes us.&#8221; Reliable flanker Boom Prinsloo also left the union last week to join the Bulls.
