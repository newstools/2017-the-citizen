The infamous Gupta family, dogged by claims of state capture, are reportedly looking into acquiring a new palace in Constantia, Cape Town, but this faces stiff opposition from several residents who are worried about another Gupta compound mushrooming on the sort of scale seen at their Johannesburg Saxonwold property. The Sunday Times reported at the weekend that plans for the mansion that used to belong to Mark Thatcher the son of former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher includes lopping off a thatched roof, building a double-storey second dwelling and upgrading a lavish entertainment area. Ratepayers are said to be concerned about parallels between the family s Saxonwold home and their Constantia application, following reports that the Guptas are in a dispute with officials from the City of Johannesburg over alleged building infringements. Craig Pretorius, an urban planner with the Saxonwold and Parkwood Residents&#8217; Association, told the paper the council had rejected an application to retrospectively legalise structures it never approved. A second successful application lodged by the family is also under appeal, according to the report. The Gupta Saxonwold compound is a triple-storey palace with a kitchen on each floor. Residents have apparently claimed that the flat roof is a fourth storey, which has been denied by the family. Given the scale of proposals and the purported usage, we are concerned this property will be used for purposes other than residential, the Constantia Ratepayers&#8217; and Residents&#8217; Association circular reportedly said about the proposed upgrades.
