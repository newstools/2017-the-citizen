The plight of the residents of the dilapidated Wattville Hostels in Benoni remains unresolved. This two years after the provincial government visited the area and promised to find an alternative place for the residents. After a visit to the area, the premier undertook to assist the hostel dwellers, who live in squalid conditions. But that has not happened yet. Premier David Makhura, answering questions from DA MPL Michele Clarke in the provincial legislature yesterday, admitted that there were no immediate plans for the residents, who live in squalid conditions. He told Clarke that the &#8220;planning phase&#8221; was complete but the provincial government and the City of Ekurhuleni were awaiting the demolition certificate from the Heritage Authority to demolish the old buildings. &#8220;What is unclear [is] where exactly the residents of Wattville Hostels will be placed once demolition takes place. Hostel dwellers have reported to the DA that they have not been consulted on the decision to be placed in the proposed &#8216;walk up&#8217; RDP flats that the premier highlighted today,&#8221; Clarke said. Clarke, who is the constituency head for Benoni, said when the DA visited the area, it could not see how the R7 million said to have been spent on the hostel, was used. &#8220;The premier admitted that the money spent was a colossal waste and to spend further money would be akin to throwing money into a bottomless pit. &#8220;The residents cannot continue to be subjected to inhumane living conditions, however, it would seem that the government has washed their hands of the residents&#8217; problems,&#8221; Clarke said. In separate answers on human settlements in the provinces, MEC Paul Mashatile said the provincial government&#8217;s ultimate objective was to get rid of all hostels in the province. &#8220;We want to do away with hostels,&#8221; Mashatile said ALSO READ: The SA government hasn t given up the fight for nuclear For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
