Economic Freedom Fighters leader Julius Malema has again shared what he thinks will happen in the African National Congress (ANC) in the next 20 years. Malema was addressing a crowd that was demonstrating outside the Newcastle Magistrates&#8217; Court after his appearance on Friday. According to Malema, President Jacob Zuma has a 20-year plan on how the ANC should be run and how he can avoid the &#8220;783 charges of corruption against him&#8221;. &#8220;Zuma has a 20-year plan on how to avoid the 783 charges of corruption. We must fight this, avoid SA from being a monarchy,&#8221; he said. The president, however, is not a problem, said Malema. &#8220;He is just an irritation.&#8221; The real problem is &#8220;white monopoly capital&#8221; which his party will confront by removing the president. Malema has always accused the ruling party for doing everything to please whites. However, all that will be over soon as the EFF has approached the Constitutional Court in Braamfontein to file an application to order speaker of parliament Baleka Mbete to institute impeachment or disciplinary proceedings against the president. On May 15, the party will be in the Constitutional Court to seek the secrete ballot to remove Zuma. Even if he finally steps down, the president will still rule from behind as he allegedly planned 10 years ago that his ex-wife Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma would be president of the ANC. The president has previously, in an interview, said the ruling party was ready for a female president, leaving many thinking he had indirectly endorsed Dlamini-Zuma. However, it does not stop there, according to Malema, who said after Dlamini-Zuma, the president&#8217;s son, Edward Zuma would lead the ruling party. &#8220;Edward Zuma went to disrupt the Nkandla ANC branch meeting four weeks ago fighting to be a chairperson. Why? He&#8217;s going to lead ANC,&#8221; he said. People must stop voting for a &#8220;junk&#8221; ANC, said Malema, who thinks this is the only way to avoid a &#8220;junk country&#8221;.
