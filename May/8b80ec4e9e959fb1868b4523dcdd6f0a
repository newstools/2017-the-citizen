The Vivas are an initiative of the International Council of Shopping Centres (ICSC) and are the most recognised achievement for professional excellence in the global retail real estate industry.

As a gold winner of the South African Council of Shopping Centres (SACSC) Retail Design and Development Awards, the ICSC s regional awards programme, Mall of Africa was automatically entered in the prestigious Viva global awards. Mall of Africa holds the honour of being the only mall on the African continent to achieve recognition in the awards in this category this year. Cobus van Heerden of Atterbury on Thursday said the Mall of Africa, which opened on 28 April 2016, was inspired by leading international trends in design elements and underpinned by solid retail property fundamentals. From its conception to its design and development, Mall of Africa was envisioned to create a world-class mall with a unique shopping experience, unlike anywhere else, van Heerden said.
