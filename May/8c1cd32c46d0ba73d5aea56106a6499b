Tennis is the latest big(ish) federation to have signalled its commitment to transformation to government. Following the release of the Sport Ministry&#8217;s latest Transformation Barometer report on Tuesday, Tennis South Africa (TSA) announced they had now also signed a memorandum of agreement with the department and Sascoc. It&#8217;s pretty much the same agreement that rugby, cricket, netball, soccer and athletics has with government. Also read: Tennis SA has a plan to re-live the glory days &#8220;TSA is excited to finalise this agreement. It provides us with a great opportunity to work with government and Sascoc to grow our sport,&#8221; said Richard Glover, TSA&#8217;s chief executive. TSA is actually so serious about the issue that they placed their draft transformation strategy online for public comment. It&#8217;s an interesting exercise. There are no bold promises of increasing participation among the black population or cliches. Instead, TSA don&#8217;t shy away from the harsh realities of a sport many still consider elitist. Tennis is a very technical sport when players start out. As a result, the need for specialised coaching is very important and arguably a bigger priority for TSA than recruiting new players to the sport. TSA&#8217;s biggest two objectives then in what it calls its &#8220;development pathway off the court&#8221; is access to equipment and infrastructure as well as removing barriers of entry for coaches. In other words, the transformation process can only start if a kid has a racket and a court to play on as well newly qualified coaches to introduce them to the game. Only really after that can the &#8220;general&#8221; transformation aspects like quotas/targets and high performance management commence. &#8220;The new TSA plan for transformation and development is practical and achievable and has been very well received by a variety of stakeholders,&#8221; said Glover. &#8220;We are excited to start rolling it out in the coming months. We see this new plan as an exciting opportunity to ensure the sustainability of tennis in our country.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
