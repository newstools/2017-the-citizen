It sounds a bit disrespectful perhaps but if cricket fans were to be asked which South African batter they felt would make the biggest impact in this year&#8217;s Indian Premier League (IPL) would be, Hashim Amla wouldn&#8217;t be that man. The bearded Proteas star is a great player but he&#8217;s not a T20 star. At least before Sunday night&#8217;s between Kings XI Punjab and Gujarat Lions. Amla stroked a magnificent 104 off just 60 deliveries, a mere two weeks after he managed the same amount of runs off the same amount of balls. In fact, the 33-year-old veteran has been outstanding overall with 420 runs at a strike rate of 145, having also scored two fifties. To put that into perspective, Amla has gobbled up almost twice the amount of runs of Proteas one-day skipper AB de Villiers. De Villiers, far more famous for his T20 exploits, scores at a strike rate of 132 in 2017. &#8220;I&#8217;m happy to get some runs. What else can I say?&#8221; said Amla laughingly after his latest hundred. &#8220;I&#8217;m very grateful.&#8221; Yet the amount of runs he&#8217;s scored testifies to his ability to be versatile. Amla has smashed 17 sixes in this year&#8217;s campaign but you hardly would&#8217;ve realised. He never tries anything out of the ordinary and he never slogs because Amla knows that&#8217;s not his natural game. &#8220;Everybody who plays T20 cricket just needs to find a way to maximise each ball they face,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You&#8217;ll find many cricketers who have been successful in T20 cricket without looking &#8216;agricultural&#8217; as they say. &#8220;They play play proper cricket shots to get runs. I know the issue comes up every time when someone not known as a natural T20 player scores runs but over the past 10 years, the format has accommodated a lot of players like that.&#8221; The Proteas will certainly be smiling ahead of next month&#8217;s ICC Champions Trophy in England.
