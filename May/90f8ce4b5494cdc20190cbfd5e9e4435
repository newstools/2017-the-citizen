As of next week, South Africans will know whether they need to whip out extra winter woolies this year when they find out just how cold this year s winter season is going to be. According to forecaster at the South African Weather Services, Puseletso Mofokeng, they are still waiting for an updated season forecast. We don t know at this stage whether we will have an early or late winter season, but we should know anytime from next week, Mofokeng said. However, he said residents in different parts of the country can expect a slight drop in temperatures this weekend. In Gauteng on Sunday [tomorrow], residents can expect partly cloudy conditions with daytime temperatures expected to drop just below the 20 degrees Celsius mark. Other provinces in the north-eastern parts of the country, where similar conditions are expected on Sunday, include Limpopo, Mpumalanga, the eastern parts of North West as well as the Free State, he said. Mofokeng said residents in the southern and eastern parts of the country will also not be spared from the drop in temperatures this weekend. He said most of the rainfall can be expected in KwaZulu-Natal, with light drizzle set for parts of Mpumalanga and Limpopo. Another forecaster, Lulama Menze, said most of the cooler conditions over the southern and eastern parts of the country, can be expected today. An improvement in temperatures is expected from Monday. Meanwhile, residents of the Western Cape are hoping that the prediction for above normal rainfall for this winter season, will become a reality. The province has been hard hit by dry conditions and has been declared a disaster zone.
