Norma has uploaded images of herself at an exclusive tea party hosted by top luxury designer store Luminance at Hyde Park shopping centre. The store stocks high-end clothing with hefty price tags from designers such as Alexander McQueen, Manolo Blahnik and Givenchy. Norma was in the company of other seasoned socialites and media at the event that took place on Monday. The Trio &#x1f483;&#x1f3fc;&#x1f525; A post shared by Norma Gigaba (@norma.gigaba) on May 8, 2017 at 3:33am PDT On Sunday, the IT professional caused a Twitter storm when, during an interview with eNCA, she said after her husband, Malusi Gigaba, the former minister of home affairs, was offered the top position in the finance ministry by President Jacob Zuma via telephone, she told him to take it. &#8220;I told him the rand will drop, and it will go up. I told him I believe in him a lot. He s such a fast learner, and he works hard. She made comments about Malusi&#8217;s hesitation to take up the position of head of Treasury, saying he felt he had accomplished a lot. She said they had &#8220;transformed&#8221; the home affairs ministry together, as she had assisted with passports, resulting in shorter queues.

Shortly after the interview aired, some poked fun at Norma for being out of touch with South African reality and advised her to &#8220;just smile and look pretty&#8221;.
