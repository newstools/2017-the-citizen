While she had started giving motivational talks on knowing your self-worth, Karabo was also a source of comfort and inspiration for her best friend. Stephanie Leong began a social media search for Mokoena, circulating her images on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, a day after she went missing on April 28. Though Mokoena&#8217;s torched body was found on April 29, her boyfriend, Sandile Mantsoe, was arrested last week Thursday in connection with her murder. Long shared a screenshot of a WhatsApp text sent to her by Mokoena. &#8220;The world may not see your worth and value, but I pray that God may enlarge your territory and impress upon your heart how special you are to him and all of us.&#8221; The full message is below &#8220;Where will I find a friend like you. You loved me so much and saw so much potential in me, you spoke life giving words into my life always&#8230;Karabo I wish you would just call me and this nightmare would end. I miss you so much,&#8221; wrote Leong alongside the screenshot. Leong has been sharing videos of herself and Mokoena on her Instagram page. Karabo&#8217;s last birthday.
