Acting chairperson of the portfolio committee on public enterprises Zukiswa Rantho says she &#8220;will not sleep&#8221; until she gets to the bottom of the latest revelations by committee member and DA shadow minister of public enterprises, Natasha Mazzone, that Eskom is shredding Brian Molefe&#8217;s documents. She indicated that this might be a desperate attempt by Eskom to destroy all Molefe-related paper trails. Mazzone, who also revealed the power utility is suing her for R80 million, earlier this afternoon informed the media that a &#8220;source&#8221; within Eskom had tipped her off that there was a massive document-shredding operation currently taking place at the power utility head office in Megawatt Park, north of Johannesburg. &#8220;The DA has it on good authority that Eskom is currently in the process of destroying key documents and correspondence relating to the Molefe fiasco,&#8221; Mazzone wrote in a statement in which she further asked if Eskom management and the board had something to hide. Mazzone called on Lynne Brown, the minister of public enterprises, to investigate and confirm if this was the case. If the allegation turns out to be true, she said the minister &#8220;must ensure that no further documents are destroyed&#8221;. Colin Cruywagen, media liaison officer to the minister, told The Citizen that &#8220;if the member (Mazzone) or any other member of the public, has evidence of document shredding at Eskom, they must approach the police&#8221;. Rantho, the ANC MP who may find herself chairing parliamentary inquiry into Eskom scandals, told The Citizen she was not aware of the allegations. She said if they were true, that was worrying. &#8220;If it is true, then Eskom is committing gross misconduct and that means they will not give us the information,&#8221; she said. She also told The Citizen that if the allegations were true, the committee would seek legal advice.
