A French tennis player who tried to kiss a television reporter against her will during a live broadcast at Roland Garros was banished from the tournament on Tuesday for his &#8220;reprehensible behaviour&#8221;. Maxime Hamou, 21, grabbed Eurosport journalist Maly Thomas around the neck and shoulders while she interviewed him following his first round defeat. &#8220;It was frankly unpleasant. If it hadn&#8217;t been live on air, I would have punched him,&#8221; Thomas told the French edition of the Huffington Post. Hamou, the world number 287, was subsequently banned from the Roland Garros site by organisers. &#8220;The tournament directors have decided to cancel the accreditation of Maxime Hamou following his reprehensible behaviour with a journalist on Monday,&#8221; said a Roland Garros statement. A Eurosport spokesman said that Hamou&#8217;s actions were &#8220;highly inappropriate&#8221;. &#8220;We sincerely regret the incident that occurred during yesterday evening s interview between Maly Thomas and Maxime Hamou. The behaviour of the interviewee was highly inappropriate and we do not condone such conduct in any way,&#8221; the spokesman said. &#8220;Maly is a highly respected journalist and we are pleased that a full apology is being offered. We apologise to any viewers who may have been affected.&#8221; Hamou had already come under fire for his behaviour during a qualifying match last week when he screamed at an umpire: &#8220;Why are you here?&#8221; But it was the incident with Thomas which was causing outrage and on Twitter especially as it prompted laughs and applause from studio guests on the Eurosport programme, &#8220;Avantage Leconte&#8221;. &#8220;He kisses her by force, she tries to get away, he holds her by the neck and everyone&#8230; laughs &#8230;#tired,&#8221; tweeted French politician Cecile Duflot. French journalist Claude Askolovitch tweeted in French: &#8220;In a normal world, Maxime Hamou would be in court for sexual assault&#8221;. Hamou later Tuesday made a public apology to Thomas. &#8220;I want to offer my deepest apologies to Maly Thomas if she felt hurt or shocked by my attitude during her interview,&#8221; he was quoted a saying by L&#8217;Equipe daily.
