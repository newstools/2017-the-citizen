Media conferences in English football are invariably dramatic and interesting. Journalists tend to hammer on certain issues and it takes skill and restraint from managers to keep their composure. But Manchester United mentor Jose Mourinho took it to another level at the weekend when he shrewdly skipped his media duties without actually breaching media rules. Following a 2-0 win over Crystal Palace on Sunday&#8217;s final round of fixtures, the Red Devils&#8217; manager sneaked in to the Old Trafford media room with basically no journalists present. They were still in the press box checking out the players&#8217; lap of honour! As a result, the journos couldn&#8217;t get any clarity on Paul Pogba&#8217;s early withdrawal before Wednesday&#8217;s Europa League final or the excellent performance from 21-year-old striker Josh Harrop. Mourinho did grant MUTV &#8211; the club&#8217;s official broadcaster &#8211; a pitiful 17-second interview. Don t ask me too many things because now I am in a final, he said. Let me go home, I am in a final now. What a waste of time! For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
