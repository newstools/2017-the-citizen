Musa Mseleku&#8217;s reality TV show, Uthando neSthembu, showcasing his life as a husband to four wives and father of 10 children, left most with questions as to how he manages to take care of his family. One of the questions that were raised were how he manages to keep four women happy. Mseleku said he knew what he was signing up for when he got involved in a polygamous marriage. &#8220;I have to satisfy all my women however they want to be satisfied. It is about more than money. You can&#8217;t make excuses, you must provide everything wife wants,&#8221; he told TimesLIVE. He further said he sat down with his wives to plan how he would split his time among his wives. If he found himself at the wrong house, the wife would tell him, because &#8220;they are not selfish&#8221;. Mseleku said he had been getting proposals from women on social media, who said they wanted to be his fifth wife. He does, however, not take the messages seriously, as he shows them to his wives, and they have a good laugh about it. The 43-year-old businessman told The Sowetan he would be holding love and relationship seminars to address issues people face in relationships. The first seminar will be held in Durban on June 10, but he said he planned of taking them to other parts of the country.
