ER24 paramedics arrived on the scene to find one car in the middle of the road, ER24 spokesman Russel Meiring said. The vehicle had been split in two with pieces of debris spread across the scene. The second vehicle was found lying off the side of the road. Paramedics found the body of a man lying a short distance away from his wrecked car. In the second car, paramedics discovered the bodies of a man, a woman, and a young girl trapped in the wreckage. Unfortunately, all four patients had sustained numerous, fatal injuries. Nothing more could be done for them and they were declared dead. The cause of the collision was not yet known, Meiring said. African News Agency (ANA)
