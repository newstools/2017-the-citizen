Though actor and model Pearl Thusi turned 29 last week, she only shared pictures of the celebration on Saturday and, we must say, it was everything and more. Close friends such as &#8216;The King of African Music&#8217; Thandiswa Mazwai, DJ Zinhle, Nzinga Qunta were in attendance, along with her daughter, Thandolwethu. Thusi also shared pictures of herself with fianc Robert Marawa, proving the rumour that the two had called it quits wrong. The two look very much in love and happy. Check out the pictures Thusi shared on Instagram: Thusi with her daugher, DJ Zinhle and Linda Moeketsi. Thank you my loves&#8230; #bday things&#8230; .
