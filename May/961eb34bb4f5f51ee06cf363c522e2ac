The R1-million SA Nurs ery should be an abso lute cracker with some of the best juveniles seen for some time lining up for this Grade 1 race over 1160m at Turffontein on Saturday. The SA Nursery is one of four Grade 1 races to be run on Cham pions Day with the final declara tions for the R4-million Premier s Champions Challenge, the R2- million SA Derby and R1-million Computaform Sprint announced last week. As expected, the four leading contenders come from the stables of Sean Tarry and Mike de Kock. Tarry saddles Barrack Street, al ready a winner of two features on the Highveld, as well as Wonder wall, who placed second in two races in the Western Cape before winning a Maiden Juvenile Plate by 4.75 lengths. He beat Naafer, who next time came out to win a Maiden Plate against older horses by 5.25 lengths. The ground was yielding when he ran the first time and he wasn t a happy horse. He was a dif ferent horse when the ground was on top, explained De Kock yester day. He s top horse. He also saddles Mustaaqeem who was one of the most impres sive winners seen this season, cruising home by 7.50 lengths with jockey Callan Murray looking over his shoulder 300m from home. That was a bit of a surprise, not that he won, but the margin of the win, said De Kock. He is very laid back and doesn t give away a lot at home. But I prefer horses who bring it to the track. The fields for the balance of the card were also finalised yesterday.
