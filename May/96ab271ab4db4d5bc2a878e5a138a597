Their parent union is bankrupt, their previous president charged with corruption and their Super Rugby future is uncertain. Yet the Kings are playing like, well, kings. A brilliant 35-32 win over the high-flying Sharks means Deon Davids&#8217; now have more log points than the Waratahs, Force, Reds, Rebels, Bulls, Cheetahs and Sunwolves. And one wonders: how can Saru cut these men from Super Rugby? Talent isn&#8217;t everything The greatest lesson the Kings have taught South African rugby this year is that nothing beats a well-coached team. The Bulls, for example, have world-class players within their ranks but because of inexperienced (and some would say inferior) coaching, they&#8217;re nowhere. Deon Davids, the Kings coach, has delivered a feast from crumbs. &#8220;It&#8217;s not always talent that wins you games,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s more about the guts and the players in the team. It s about the spirit guts and willingness that the guys have to carry team over.&#8221; Of course there are some excellent prospects in the current group but the real joy is how their starting to show the fruits of their relative stability. &#8220;That was special in terms of this win. It was a hard-fought battle. I always believed towards the end that we could win it. After we conceded a try I sent out a message that we must stick to our plan,&#8221; said Davids. They did. Pat Lambie&#8217;s curse continues What must the Sharks and Springbok flyhalf do just to stay on the field? It&#8217;s the question of numerous despairing fans as the 26-year-old playmaker had to leave the field with concussion during the Kings skirmish. He had just returned from a back injury. &#8220;Pat&#8217;s injury was obviously a setback,&#8221; said a sombre Robert du Preez, the Sharks coach. Ironically, that lowlight also provided a highlight for the Sharks. In Lambie&#8217;s absence, Garth April shone with excellent goal-kicking and good distribution as replacement. &#8220;We certainly have players capable of fixing that issue,&#8221; said Du Preez. Promotion of youth comes at a cost Bulls coach Nollis Marais said he was &#8220;proud&#8221; of the young side he put on the field against the Highlanders. And they certainly showed guts in muddy conditions. But it was also lock RG Snyman&#8217;s red card that cost them as the New Zealanders scored the winning try after that to prevail by 17-10. &#8220;It was unfortunate that the seven-point turnaround was costly. At the end of the day RG is 21 and there&#8217;s not much I can say,&#8221; said Marais. &#8220;He played well and he made a mistake. He&#8217;s feeling bad because he knows how it important it was for the team and for me.&#8221; That&#8217;s fair enough on paper but it&#8217;s cold comfort for gatvol Bulls fans.
