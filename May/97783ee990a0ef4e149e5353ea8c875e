Last year s Tsogo Sun Sprint winner Talkto thestars is healthy, fine and fit and trainer Coenie de Beer is hoping for a good run in the R1-million Grade 1 sprint at Scottsville on Saturday. The five-year-old Overlord gelding has followed nearly the same route to the 1200m feature as 12 months ago, although finish ing eighth instead of first in the Senor Santa Handicap this time around. His last run was in the Grade 1 Computaform Sprint over 1000m, a race in which he has fin ished second two years running &#8211; this year going down 1.30 lengths to Rafeef. So it s all systems go for Talk tothestars, who handicappers be lieved ran to a merit rating of 121 here last year. His rating subse quently dipped as low as 110 but he is now back to 113 &#8211; his last Tsogo Sun winning mark. Bookmakers have him at 12-1. One interesting runner in this year s race is Janoobi, who will be off to Dubai at the end of the season. He has two more runs in South Africa before he goes, the Tsogo Sun Sprint and the Rising Sun Gold Challenge over 1600m, said Mathew de Kock yesterday. As far as the 1200m race is con cerned we are testing the waters. He has such a high cruising speed and he s well handicapped so he s got to have a chance. How he performs is going to help us de cide where to aim him next year. The only 1600m race on Dubai World Cup Night is the Godolphin Mile but that is on the dirt. If he does do well in sprints we have ad ditional options but if not we can always look at races like the Hong Kong Mile, if he is good enough. De Kock also has Naafer run ning at Scottsville on Saturday in the R750,000 Tsogo Sun Me dallion for two-year-olds and the stable is expecting a massive run. Naafer s had a very good prep and we re very happy with him. He s fit and well and he ll go close, I m sure, said De Kock. The stable s Grade 1 SA Nursery winner Mustaqeem will be rested for the remainder of the season while the future of his full brother, Computaform Sprint winner Rafeef, has yet to be decid ed.
