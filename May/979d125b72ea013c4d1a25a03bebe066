The late Limpopo agriculture MEC Joy Matshoge was allegedly paid a salary for six months after her death in June last year. Her successor Mapula Mokaba-Phukwana reportedly uncovered the details of her continued remuneration after joining the department following premier Stan Mathabatha&#8217;s provincial Cabinet reshuffle, Sunday World has reported. Mokaba-Phukwana made the discovery in December while signing off documents in her office. Following the discovery, Matshoge&#8217;s secretary Matete Duba has reportedly been kicked out of the MEC&#8217;s office allegedly for hiding the late MEC&#8217;s pay slips from July to December last year. She then reported the matter to the provincial legislature&#8217;s standing committee on public accounts (Scopa) for investigation. However, Scopa leader Snowy Kennedy-Monyemoratho reportedly told Sunday World they could not deal with the matter as it was within the MEC&#8217;s powers to institute an investigation and involve law enforcement agencies. Mokaba-Phukwana&#8217;s spokesperson Joel Seabe reportedly confirmed the department was looking into the matter. Duba said the dinner set was procured by Matshoge&#8217;s office but the process started before her death. Matshoge was earning an annual salary of R1.8 million at the time of her death. Matshoge died in a car crash on the N1 south near Mokopane in Limpopo in June last year. It was reported that she was travelling alone when she apparently lost control of the car after a tyre burst.
