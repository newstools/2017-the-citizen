Apple, Facebook and Google logos have been removed from a giant statue of a mythical beast that will stand inside the sprawling cremation complex being built for Thailand&#8217;s late king after their inclusion caused an online outcry. Dozens of palace artisans are working around the clock to produce a dizzying array of sculptures for the funeral of King Bhumibol Adulyadej in October &#8212; a year after the deeply revered monarch&#8217;s death plunged the nation into mourning. One of the leading artists included logos for the tech giants on a two-metre tall statue of the Garuda &#8212; a half-bird-half-human creature in Hindu and Buddhist mythology &#8212; as a way of paying tribute to Bhumibol&#8217;s embrace of technology. But their inclusion sparked a backlash when photos of the statue were published online, prompting their removal and an apology from the artist. &#8220;I have to apologise, I did this job to show my pride for His Majesty like everyone else,&#8221; artist Pitak Chalermlao said in a Facebook post showing the logos had been removed. He added that Bhumibol &#8220;was a thinker&#8221; who &#8220;made the world a smaller place&#8221; and that those tech companies became influential during his reign. The Apple and Google logos were nestled in the centre of each of the Garuda&#8217;s wings while a Facebook logo was etched onto the animal&#8217;s belt buckle. &#8220;I think it was not suitable for a cremation site,&#8221; one user wrote on the popular Thai forum Pantip. Another added: &#8220;Apple, Google and Facebook would have smiled at such free advertising during a key event.&#8221; Cremations for senior Thai royals are huge, arcane and costly affairs, but a monarch&#8217;s funeral &#8212; the last one was in 1950 &#8212; is on an even more monumental scale. The 50-metre high funeral complex springing up outside Bangkok&#8217;s Grand Palace will be adorned with hundreds of statues, from Hindu gods to animals and mythical beasts. The cremation will take place on October 26 as part of a five day send-off planned for the monarch. His rule spanned seven tumultuous decades that witnessed significant economic growth but saw democratic aspirations wilt under the weight of multiple palace-endorsed coups. The monarchy is also shielded by a draconian lese majeste law that has seen critics sentenced to decades behind bars. The law was used more frequently towards the end of Bhumibol&#8217;s reign, often for comments posted on social media.
