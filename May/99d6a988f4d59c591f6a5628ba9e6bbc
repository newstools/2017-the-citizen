Former Generations actor Thato Molamu walked into the Pretoria Magistrates&#8217; Court attempting to hide his face with a cap when he appeared for a drunk driving charge. The 32-year-old and newly appointed East Coast Radio presenter was arrested for allegedly driving under the influence of alcohol when he was stopped in his Jaguar in Sunnyside, Pretoria, on Friday. The TV star said he would plead guilty at his next appearance on June 29. Although he stated he would be conducting his own defence, he was advised by the court to seek legal aid or a private attorney, as the case was of a technical nature. His bail was extended, but the actor was warned he would be arrested should he fail to return to the court next month. Molamu was allegedly spotted in the early hours of Friday morning in a Jaguar on the corner of Nelson Mandela Drive and Rissik Street. Police spokesperson Captain Daniel Mavimbela said the star did not exercise caution. Mavimbela said the case would be investigated further. The father of two was among 16 actors who were sacked from the popular SABC 1 soapie over a salary dispute in 2015. He joined the show in 2011 playing the character of Nicholas Nomvete. &#8211; rorisangk@citizen.co.za For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
