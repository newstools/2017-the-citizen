A former prosecutor facing charges of sexual assault and possession of child pornography, appeared in the Parow Sexual Offences Court on Friday. Formerly based at the Atlantis Magistrate s Court, he appeared in the Parow Sexual Offences Court, before Magistrate Elsa van Zyl. He was arrested on December 29 last year, and released on bail of R1 000. At an earlier hearing he informed the court he wished to appoint a privately-funded lawyer. He has not done so yet, and the case was postponed to June 30. Due to the sexual nature of offences with which he is charged, he may not be named until his trial commences. The charge sheet does not give any details of the charges, and the prosecutor said the charges would only be finalised after the completion of the investigation. One of the bail conditions bans him from going to Malmesbury or Atlantis, without the permission of the investigating officer. The man said he would live in Robertson with his former wife and daughter, and it transpired also that he was receiving therapy for his affliction in Robertson. He was also attending group support sessions in Malmesbury, he told the court.
