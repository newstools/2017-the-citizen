Police in Lingelethu West, Khayelitsha, in Cape Town, have arrested two men for armed robbery and being in possession of suspected stolen property, Western Cape police said. To ensure that offenders are brought to book, Lingelethu police acted on information when they were approached by members of the community [on Friday afternoon]. They were informed that three suspects had been robbing people in Ekuphumleni, Khayelitsha, spokesperson Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said. Police followed up on the information from one of the victims and arrested two suspects aged 19 and 22. A search was then conducted at the house and two cellphones that had been robbed from the complainants were recovered. More presumed stolen property was also found at the address. The confiscated items included a South African Police Service (SAPS) bulletproof vest that had been stolen, identity documents, bank cards, and three more bulletproof vests stolen from a security company. It was later discovered that the bulletproof vests had been stolen during a Kleinvlei hijacking case. Both suspects would appear in the Khayelitsha Magistrates Court on Monday on armed robbery charges. Police management commended the police officers for their efforts to bring the perpetrators to justice and thanked the community members who reported the criminals, Rwexana said.
