A 52-year-old man is expected to appear in the Vredenburg Magistrate s Court for fraud valued at R8.4 million, the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (the Hawks) said on Thursday. Hawks spokesperson Captain Lloyd Ramovha said the man was arrested by the Serious Commercial Crime Unit of the Hawks on Tuesday. It is alleged that the suspect defrauded the Western Cape Department of Marine and Coastal Management since the year 2002 using fishing entities he was affiliated to, amongst them are the now defunct; Yellow Star Trading 1004 Pty (Ltd), Sandy Point Fishing Pty (Ltd) and Kalahari Fishing, Ramovha said. Ramovha said that the man s method allegedly involved manipulating the systems by unlawfully and falsely under declaring the quantities of fish caught to the department, whilst the actual fish caught exceeded the allowed quota and he would further profit from the concealed loot. The department reportedly suffered losses amounting to approximately R8,485,836.12 as a result of his fishy dealings. Ramovha said the suspect is expected to face charges of fraud and contraventions of sections of the marine living resource Act. The man is expected to appear in court next month.
