Amidst the booeing was singing and loud chants for Zuma to go. Workers at the rally sang a song in Sesotho which loosely translated says: &#8216;We heard the good news that Zuma is going&#8217; and &#8216;Zuma must go.&#8217; Zuma left the rally after Cosatu announced that he would no longer deliver a speech. Cosatu President Sdumo Dlamini and ANC NEC member Naledi Pandor were also booed and did not address the crowd.
