While the music industry and the public have been watching with keen interest to see if indeed Mabala Noise will emerge victorious at the Samas after their top rap artist Nasty C made a clean sweep at the Metro FM Awards earlier this year, they were surprised to see that indeed the record label failed to make any major impact. Nasty C was nominated for a record five categories and together with Ambitiouz Entertainment&#8217;s Amanda Black was set to be the most decorated artist at the awards. Nasty C walked away empty handed, ending his dominance of the local music industry. The best rap album went to Kwesta for his offering Dakar, Kwesta also enjoyed having the highest airplay for his song Ngud. Nasty C&#8217;s record label, Mabala Noise has been under a cloud since it was revealed by EFF leader Julius Malema that it had allegedly paid R5 million for new artists last year. The label was also accused of buying awards at the Metros, a claim which it vehemently denied. After winning a slew of Metro FM awards, beating out Babes Wodoumo and kwaito singer Dr Malinga who also won best kwaito album, Nasty C was expected to make a clean sweep again. But, it seems that Dr Malinga has had the last laugh after he got into a Twitter spat with the 19-year-old rapper, saying his award actually belonged to Babes. Nasty C called Dr Malinga derogatory terms while the artist famous for his high kick said all would be settled at the Samas.
