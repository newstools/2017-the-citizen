Following the report on Wednesday that security official, Lorenzo Afrika, testified in the Henri van Breda trial that no alarms sounded on the night of the Van Breda family murders, on Thursday the second security guard called to the stand testified he did not find anything to be out of the ordinary on that night. EWN reports the security guard, Edgar Wyngaard, when questioned by state prosecutor Susan Galloway as to whether there was anything unusual which he had seen or heard on the night of the murders, answered no, adding that he checked the CCTV cameras, physically checked the perimeter fence after 1am in the morning, and he did not find anything that stood out as being out of the ordinary. According to TimesLive, Wyngaard was also reported as saying that on his shift, he would have driven past the house &#8220;between six and seven times&#8221;. TimesLive also reports Wyngaard said the estate&#8217;s walls were too high for someone to scale. He was responding to questions by Henri van Breda&#8217;s defence council, and said he and Afrika monitored the estate and that the residents would complain if they heard anything and dogs would bark. According to the report by EWN, Advocate Matthys Combrink argued there were several ways in which it would be possible to climb over the electric fence, suggesting that two people could help each other and use insulated material. Wyngaard reportedly said an anti-tampering alarm would be triggered and that it would be risky. &nbsp; ALSO READ: Van Breda trial: Security official says no alarms went off on night of murders
