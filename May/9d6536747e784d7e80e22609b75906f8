Mahamat further reiterated the solidarity of the AU in Chad and the other countries of the Lake Chad basin through continued support for the work of the mixed multinational force (FMM). In line with its support for the countries affected by the atrocities of the terrorist group Boko Haram, the president of the commission, together with the commissioner for peace and security, will immediately undertake a visit to the countries of the region to ensure the AU s determination to continue its contribution to their efforts to combat Boko Haram.
