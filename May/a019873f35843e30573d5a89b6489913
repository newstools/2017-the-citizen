One has to go back to October to find Forest Fox s last win but Paul Peter s charge will get the perfect opportunity to get back in the winner s enclosure when he lines up in Race7 at the Vaal tomorrow, a MR 88Handicap over 1400m on the Outside track. This five-year-old gelding has faced far better than he meets in this event and rarely runs a bad race. Looking back at his record over the last few months he has finished4.15 lengths behind Rafeef over 1400m at Turffontein when drawn badly, 0.60 lengths behind Kangaroo Jack in a Pinnacle Stakes and 2.20 lengths off New Predator in a Conditions Plate, again over the same course and distance. All three winners have come out trumps in Graded races and there is nothing close to that level in this field. In his last start, again over 1400m at Turffontein, he had to overcome the widest of draws and got too far back. He flew up late to finish a 1.90-length third behind Amazing Strike. Forest Fox has won two of his four races over the course and distance and with the drop in class he could be a hard horse to beat. Gavin Lerena, who will shortly be off to ply his trade in the UK, gets a perfect opportunity to notch up another win before he jets out on Friday. Refuge has been racing over1200m lately but is likely to enjoy a return to 1400m. Three of his five wins have been at this track and one of them was over this distance with Piere Strydom up. He takes the ride again for the Scott Kenny yard and looks the runner to chase home Forest Fox. These days one cannot ignore a horse from the Sean Tarry yard and he sends out Count Tassilo. Although not among the best in his yard this four-year-old son of Silvano has won three of his 15starts and if anything like many of his sire s progeny, is likely to improve with age. He also ran behind Amazing Strike and although 0.5kg better off with Forest Fox, looks unlikely to turn the form around. S manga Khumalo takes the ride.
