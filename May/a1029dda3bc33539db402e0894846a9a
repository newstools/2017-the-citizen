A couple offered a R200 bribe to police officers after they were caught naked having sex in a car that was parked at a hijacking hotspot in Pretoria. The two police constables were patrolling when they spotted an Audi A3 parked on the corner of Justice Mohamed Street and Steve Biko Road in Sunnyside on Friday. This is an intersection that is identified as a hijacking hotspots. When the police approached the car, the officers found a man and a woman having sex inside, police spokesperson Captain Daniel Mavimbela said. When realising they were caught in the act, the man allegedly offered the constables R200 in exchange for freedom , Mavimbela said. The officers wouldn t have any of that. They waited for the couple to get dressed before taking them to the local police station. Mavimbela said motorists have been previously warned of sitting in their parked cars, as it increased dangers of hijackings. It is baffling that people still drop their guts to the lowest levels regardless of the risk involved. The couple will appear at the Pretoria Magistrates&#8217; Court soon on charges of bribery and public indecency.
