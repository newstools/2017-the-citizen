The triumphant Blitzboks are in the ideal position, having won the World Series Sevens title in Paris last weekend with this week s last event in London to go. Neil Powell s team have done unbelievably well, winning five of the nine events on offer this season and finishing second on three occasions. Wins in Dubai, Wellington, Sydney, Las Vegas and Paris ensured they won the title for only the second time, following their solo win in 2008-09. They also finished second in Cape Town, Hong Kong and Vancouver. The South African team have been ruthlessly consistent, finishing runners-up over the past four seasons and third at the Rio Olympics, before clearing the final hurdle this year. Coach Powell, who became the first person to win the series as a player and coach, pointed to hard work as the reason for their success. Thank goodness for the Blitzboks, as Springbok rugby probably endured their worst year in 2016, so this triumph shows all is not lost. SA won t have it easy this weekend as they have been grouped with the US, Wales and Kenya in a tricky Pool A. Having said that, though, they are world champions so the other nations should be shaking in their boots, especially since the Blitzboks have already won in London twice before: in 2005 and 2011.
