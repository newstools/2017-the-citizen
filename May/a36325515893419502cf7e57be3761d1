The Gumede family were still in shock by the sudden disappearance of their daughter Philile Gumede, who has been missing for two weeks just after her graduation. . The 28-year-old woman recently graduated and held her honors degree in Education on April 21 at the Tshwane University of Technology and was working as a teacher at Baleseng Primary School. According to Philile s brother Owen Gumede, the family found out about her disappearance from their little sister who was contacted by her Philile&#8217;s colleagues as she was absent from work while her phone remained off. &#8220;My little sister and I went to the Soshanguve police station to open a missing person&#8217;s report. We were told she was last seen around 9am on 22 April after she was dropped off by who we believe to be her boyfriend,&#8221; Gumede told The Citizen. Police spokesperson Constable Zanele Mtsweni said: According to the man who dropped her off, Philile wanted to get few items there. The Gumedes suspected that the man who was last seen with her might have kidnapped her. . Mtshweni said they have interviewed her friends and people she has been recently romantically involved and were using that information to follow up on leads. But Mtshweni said there were no suspects as yet and confirmed that the family indeed expressed concerns of a kidnapping. They suspecting the person who was last seen with her might have taken her but there is no proof at this point and the person was brought in for questioning. We are looking into that, Mtsweni said. Gumede said he had been receiving threats from an unknown number telling him that his life was in danger, adding that police have done nothing about the anonymous calls. Mtshweni encouraged Gumede to report any useful information to police. Anyone with information can contact 012 730 1300 / 082 414 5436, Mtshweni said.
