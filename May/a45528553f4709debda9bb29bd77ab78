On a global scale, about 235 million people have asthma, according to the World Health Organisation.What is asthma?Asthma is a common chronic lung disease in which the lung airways, become inflamed. This inflammation causes the airways to become sensitive to environmental triggers, such as dust, smoke, pet dander, or cold air.In reaction to these triggers, an asthma attack can occur. The muscles around the bronchial tubes tighten, the lining of the airways swells and becomes inflamed, and the airways overproduce mucus, making it difficult to breathe.What causes asthma?It s unknown what exactly causes asthma, but scientists believe that a combination of genetic and environmental factors plays a role in the development of the disease.You re also more likely to have asthma if you have a predisposition toward certain allergic hypersensitivity reactions, such as atopic eczema and hay fever.Hence asthma and allergies often go hand in hand.Having respiratory infections during infancy or early childhood is another risk factor for asthma.These infections can cause inflammation in the lungs and damage lung tissue, affecting lung function later in life.In addition, a pregnant woman s diet and exposure to allergens or smoke may affect her child s risk of developing asthma later in life, according to the National Institutes of Health.Types of asthma Allergic asthmaAllergens are a common trigger of asthma in some people.This condition, called allergic asthma, occurs because the immune system reacts to harmless substances in the environment by releasing antibodies called immunoglobulin E.These antibodies cause certain immune system cells to release chemicals that produce inflammation in the lungs.Common allergens associated with allergic asthma include: cockroaches, household dust mites, mould, pet dander (skin flakes), urine, faeces, saliva, and hair, fungi and pollen Exercise-induced asthmaAs many as 90 per cent of people with asthma will experience airflow obstruction and asthma symptoms while exercising.Previously known as exercise-induced asthma, this condition is now called exercise-induced broncho-constriction. People without asthma, particularly those who are in poor shape, may also experience this condition.Exercising in cold, dry air is more likely to cause exercise induced broncho-constriction than exercising in warm, humid air.Pollution, pollen, cigarette smoke, and other airborne irritants as well as having a cold or a recent asthma attack can also raise your risk of experiencing this type of asthma.The symptoms for this type of asthma include:1. Usually don t occur immediately after you start exercising.2. Are typically worse 5 to 10 minutes after you stop exercising and tend to disappear within 20 to 30 minutes.3. May return after 4 to 12 hours after exercising and may take 24 hours to disappear. Night-time asthmaNight-time asthma, also, is a common type of asthma. If you have asthma, the chances of having symptoms are much higher during sleep because asthma is powerfully influenced by the sleep-wake cycle.Your asthma symptoms of wheezing, cough, and troubled breathing are common and dangerous, particularly at night time.Studies show that the most deaths related to asthma occur at night.This may be because of increased exposure to allergens (asthma triggers), cooling of the airways, reclining position, or even hormone secretions that follow a sleeping pattern.If you have asthma and notice your symptoms worsening as evening progresses, it s time to see your doctor and figure out the causes of asthma.Understanding the right asthma medications and when to take them are key to managing night time asthma and getting quality sleep.
