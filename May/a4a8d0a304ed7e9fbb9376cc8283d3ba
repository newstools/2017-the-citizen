TV presenter and model Bonang Matheba has opened up about her early life and ambitions in life in a documentary, Six Zeros to my Name. Bonang, born in Mahikeng, lived there for a few years before moving to Joburg with her parents. She stayed in Hillbrow before moving to Pimville, in Soweto, to live with her grandmother. While the Queen B said she had an amazing childhood, she always craved to have a &#8220;family unit&#8221;, with her mother and father together and growing up with siblings, something she did not have. &#8220;But my parents gave me more than that. They gave me love and attention. It was a physical separation, but the love they had for each other and me outweighed everything that was happening around me.&#8221; They were very mature and amicable with each other, she said. Her father, Andrew Gampi Matheba, a professor, said the two made sure the divorce was not about Bonang, but between the parents. &#8220;Even after the divorce, we grew closer together,&#8221; he said. He always knew his daughter would be in the media, as &#8220;she has a lively personality, or a vivacious personality. It&#8217;s something that&#8217;s within her. She was born that way. She&#8217;s always had talent, even as a child&#8221;. Below are a few things we learned about Bonang from the documentary: She paid off her first house at age 22 and bought another one at 29. She has a glam squad: a designer, make-up artist, strategist, lawyer, PR and marketing manager. It is estimated she makes up to R200 000 from her Revlon deal. She spends money on securing her future. &#8220;Maybe in 20 years&#8217; time, no one is going to care about this documentary or Bonang,&#8221; she said. She has been been saving since she was 15. Her favourite clothing brands are Christian Louboutin and Jimmy Choo. She also spends her money on shoes. &#8220;I&#8217;m terrible, I don&#8217;t know how many pairs of shoes I have, honestly. Maybe 200, 300.&#8221; Vinolia Mashego on Jam Alley inspired her to be a presenter. Basetsana Khumalo is her inspiration. She went to UJ, Kingsway campus, and studied BA marketing communications before dropping out to pursue a career in presenting. She&#8217;s a &#8220;softy&#8221; and used to cry about the negative comments about her on social media. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been called every name under the sun,&#8221; she said. She tackled the comments by just ignoring them. &#8220;There&#8217;s power in silence, often it wins you the war,&#8221; she said. She auditioned for Real Goboza, but was not successful. She also auditioned for Rhythm City, for a character called Tshidi, but didn&#8217;t get it. She auditioned several times for LIVE before getting the gig. She sent her demo twice to Yfm before getting it. While she was on LIVE, she was auditioning for Top Billing. Presenting and modeling is not all Bonang is doing; she has a production company and is currently shooting her reality TV show, Being Bonang, and her book will be in stores soon. She is also planning to have her own merchandise on her website. Watch the full video below:
