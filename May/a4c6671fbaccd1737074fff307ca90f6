Exciting times lie ahead for Zahara&#8217;s fans, as they will be getting front-row seats into her life. Speaking to Tshisa LIVE, Zahara said the series would chronicle her daily activities. &#8220;It is going to document my everyday life and adventures. From the moment I wake up to the first thing I drink in the morning. &#8220;I have camera crews following me and documenting some of the things I have been doing. I want it to be as real as possible, and so it is unscripted and completely real,&#8221; she said. No doubt the her new reality show will put paid to rumours she is having financial difficulty since it was reported she had defaulted on payments to her luxury German car, an Audi 5. A tabloid reported Zahara was in arrears of R350 000 and in danger of losing her car. This isn&#8217;t the first time Zahara&#8217;s finances have come under the spotlight after she had also apparently stopped making payments to her Little Falls house last year.
