Three people were killed and seven others were injured in three collisions on the M1 between the Grayston and Woodmead turn-offs in Sandton in Johannesburg early on Sunday morning, paramedics said. ER24 paramedics arrived on the scene and found the local authorities were already in attendance, ER24 spokesman Russel Meiring said. Upon closer inspection paramedics discovered two men lying inside a light motor vehicle. A woman and man were found lying in the second vehicle. Assessment showed that a man and woman had sustained fatal injuries. Nothing could be done for them and they were declared [dead]. The two remaining men were assessed and found to be in a critical condition. Paramedics treated the patients and provided them with advanced life support interventions. Once treated, the patients were transported to nearby hospitals for further treatment. While paramedics were treating the patients a secondary collision occurred about 500 metres away. A third collision occurred further down the road some time after. In these collisions, about seven people sustained minor to moderate injuries. These patients were treated for their injuries and thereafter transported to various hospitals for further treatment. Upon arrival at hospital, the critically injured man succumbed to his injuries and was pronounced dead. Local authorities were on [the] scene for further investigations, Meiring said.
