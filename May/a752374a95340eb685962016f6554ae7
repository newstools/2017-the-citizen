A Johannesburg prosecutor and his wife were arrested for corruption after he allegedly demanded R6 000 for two dockets to disappear, the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (Hawks) said on Monday. Hawks spokesperson, Captain Ndivhuwo Mulamu, said that the Hawks Serious Corruption unit in Johannesburg arrested the prosecutor and his wife on Saturday. It is alleged that the prosecutor demanded R6 000 from the two suspects who are facing charges of possession of unlicensed firearms at the Johannesburg Magistrates&#8217; Court for him to make the docket disappear, Mulamu said. The matter was then reported at the Hawks offices and an entrapment operation was conducted. Both the suspects were arrested at a restaurant in Maponya Mall on Saturday, in possession of the entrapment money brought by the alleged suspects. The couple, aged 33 and 38, are expected to appear in the Protea Magistrates&#8217; Court on Tuesday, facing corruption charges.
