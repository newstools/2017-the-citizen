Three female initiates died, possibly of food poisoning, at their initiation school in the Moteti Village, near Kwaggafontein, the Mpumalanga Health department s forum providing support at initiation schools said on Tuesday. Musa Thugwana, chairman for the forum known as the Ingoma Forum, told the African News Agency (ANA) that the initiates died on Saturday. He said 13 other initiates were taken to the Philadelphia Hospital where they were treated for the same suspected condition. The initiates vomited and complained about cramps before three of them died, said Thugwana. We suspect food poisoning as the cause of their deaths but that will be determined by our investigation. I am not sure about the ages of those who died but they might be between 13 and 18 years old. I was told those who were in hospital would be discharged yesterday (Monday), but I don t whether they have already been discharged. The Ingoma Forum is made up of a group of medical doctors and health practitioners, who are graduates from initiation schools. Thugwana said the forum was providing the necessary support for initiation schools and were appealing to parents to ensure that their children were medically tested and proved to be healthy before they are sent to initiation schools. Mpumalanga provincial police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said on Tuesday he was aware of the deaths of the three female initiates, but was not yet in a position to comment on the matter. He said the police were concerned about the complaints they were frequently getting from parents. The last time I checked the total number of initiates who have died in this province this season was four, meaning they are now seven. No arrests have been made in the investigations, said Hlathi.
