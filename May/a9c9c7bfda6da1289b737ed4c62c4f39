Trained by Stephen Moffatt, this son of Windrush loved the Vaal sand track where he won four of his six starts. When the sand course was turfed out , Roman Carnival tried his best on the grass but could not perform to any decent level. Eventually the decision was taken to send the gelding to Duncan Howells in KwaZulu-Natal to run on the Polytrack but despite placing on a few occasions, he still did not have that old sparkle. He has is now back with Moffatt and it will be interesting to see how he adapts to the sand course in Kimberley. The one issue is his merit rating. On the turf Roman Carnival raced off a 71 rating but now back on the sand his sand rating comes into play and that is still at 106. Fortunately he is running in a Pinnacle Stakes in this 1200m race so he is now the best handicapped runner. Chase Maujean rode him to three of his four victories and will be reunited with the five-year-old. Unfortunately he has not raced since December and could well be in need of the run. As a result, a better option to win this race could be Aramouse. Weiho Marwing will be bringing five runners to Kimberley and he could be one of the best. The four-year-old gelding has not raced on the sand but most progeny of Kahal enjoy the surface and with just 53kg carry and No 1 draw, Aramouse has a lot in his favour.
