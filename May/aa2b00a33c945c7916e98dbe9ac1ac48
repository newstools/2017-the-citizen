The internet is just getting scarier by the minute, and these smartphones are not helping matters either. There is a video circulating on social media that teaches people how to basically have their friend&#8217;s WhatsApp on your phone without even noticing it. You can only do it if you have the next person&#8217;s phone, so at least you&#8217;ll be hacked by a person you love most likely to be a life partner. If you&#8217;re the one interested in doing the hacking, open Google Chrome and search for WhatsApp web and select the first search result. . &nbsp; Click on the drop down menu in a form of three little circles on the top right side of the screen . Click on Request desktop site . This is the screen it will give you: . Using your poor victim&#8217;s phone, open WhatsApp. click on the drop-down menu, then WhatsApp code. and scan the code on your screen, and there, now you have your partner&#8217;s WhatsApp on your phone.
