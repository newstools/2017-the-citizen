A Twitter account supposedly belonging to Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba&#8217;s ex-nyatsi, Buhle Mkhize, has been tweeting, responding to his wife, Norma Gigaba&#8217;s recent interview with eNCA. Norma opened up about an affair her husband had with New York-based stylist Mkhize about two years ago, saying it had been a difficult time for her family. The affair became public after Mkhize wrote an open letter about it, giving her side of the story after being publicly attacked on Twitter by Norma. Though she was hurt by the affair, Norma said she worried more about her parents. &#8220;I was feeling so bad for my mother and his mother. When they were going to church, people were reading Drum magazine, they were reading papers, and now we have to explain. Norma, who has two sons with Gigaba, said she felt her husband&#8217;s affair was karma, as she was apparently his side chick when he was married to his first wife. Norma received criticism for the interview, but it seems she invited Mkhize right back in her life, exactly where she had not wanted her to begin with. &#8216;Mkhize&#8217;, who is now married, has opened a Twitter account responding to Norma&#8217;s interview. She said she was not going to sit by and watch Norma &#8220;lie&#8221; to the public. In fact, Mrs Gigaba should have refused to speak about the affair, as everyone had moved on from it, said &#8216;Mkhize&#8217;. &#8220;Could you have not declined answering that question @normzmngoma? I get interview requests on it all the time but I decline,&#8221; she wrote. Tweeting the minister directly, the woman calling herself Mkhize further warned Gigaba to keep his wife on a leash or she would reveal more details about their affair. &#8220;Stop her from ever bringing this up again or they&#8217;ll hear about December 18, you know me and documenting, I don&#8217;t slip @mgigaba. &#8220;Let&#8217;s not forget the private jet Joburg to Durban @mgigaba. Shocker !!!. You&#8217;ve never met the Guptas angithi?&#8221; &#8216;Mkhize&#8217; said Norma should have just kept quiet and live her life quietly, but now secrets that have long been kept would come out, she threatened.
