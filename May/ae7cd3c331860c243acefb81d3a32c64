There will be finally be clarity on the future of Nollis Marais as Bulls coach on Thursday evening. The union confirmed a briefing will commence at the unusual time of 19:00 with the aim of &#8220;providing details&#8221; on a &#8220;turnaround plan&#8221; announced two weeks ago. Also read: Bulls expected to replace Nollis Marais It&#8217;s been a traumatic year for the Pretoria-based franchise, who have only won three of their 11 matches in the current Super Rugby campaign. Despite the obvious need for a major structural review, it&#8217;s understood Thursday&#8217;s agenda revolves around Marais&#8217; continued employment. Following last weekend&#8217;s 51-14 thrashing at the hands of the Lions, Marais said an announcement over his future could&#8217;ve been expected this week. Pressed on the matter at Thursday morning&#8217;s team announcement for Saturday&#8217;s game against the Hurricanes, the mentor was firm in his answer. &#8220;This really is a matter for the board to inform people about,&#8221; said Marais. &#8220;I really can&#8217;t make any comment on that.&#8221; The tone of the team announcement was also unusually sombre, especially since Marais is a chirpy and straight talker. He didn&#8217;t hang around afterwards and left the venue as quickly as possible. It certainly suggested his resigned attitude. Marais has been found wanting this year as head coach but he also hasn&#8217;t been given the best of support in terms of his assistant coaches, who were forced on him by Bulls management. Reports have suggested former All Blacks and Lions coach John Mitchell has been approached to take over, while it&#8217;s also understood Springbok assistant coach Johann van Graan had been asked to give a presentation on his potential vision for the Bulls last week.
