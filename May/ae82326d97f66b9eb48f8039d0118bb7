The Competition Tribunal on Monday endorsed the Competition Commission s ruling finding Giuricich Coastal Projects guilty of collusive tendering and imposing a fine of R900 000 as an administrative penalty. Giuricich Costal Projects was found guilty of colluding with Grinaker LTA, a subsidiary of Aveng Africa in respect of a tender issued by Mondi for its plant in Durban. The tender was for the design and construction of a truck loading building, floor upgrades for automated vehicle use and the civil works necessary for the installation of reel handling conveyers at the Mondi Merebank Mill. The Commission said Grinaker LTA was first to disclose this project under the Construction Fast Track Settlement in 2011 and was granted immunity from prosecution in return for assisting the commission to prosecute Giuricich Costal Projects. The Commission successfully prosecuted the matter. Spokesperson for the Commission, Sipho Ngwema, said Giuricich Coastal Projects refused to settle the matter and the commission therefore referred it to the tribunal for prosecution in 2014. The tribunal found in favour of the Commission that, on a balance of probabilities, Grinaker LTA provided Giuricich Costal Projects with a cover price and therefore engaged in collusive tendering in contravention of section 4(1)(b)(iii) of the Competition Act, Ngwema said.
