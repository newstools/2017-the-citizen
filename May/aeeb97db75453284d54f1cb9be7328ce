Don&#8217;t give a rugby team permission to unwind &#8220;moderately&#8221;. That&#8217;s the lesson English club Bath learned after they had to launch disciplinary action against at least 10 players for poor behaviour. According to the Daily Mail, the group ran naked across the team&#8217;s field and also set off a fire extinguisher in a drunken state during a team social. It&#8217;s understood Springbok flanker Francois Louw wasn&#8217;t part of the drama. They had been given permission to chill a bit after they were eliminated from the European Challenge Cup a fortnight ago. More embarrassingly, the players had already become rowdy earlier when they disrupted a coaching clinic at the club for kids. Apparently, they started heckling flyhalf George Ford, who was busy working with the youngsters. Thankfully the children weren&#8217;t present when the streaking starting but numerous parents complained. Todd Blackadder, the former Crusaders coach and now director of rugby at Bath, is furious over the incident. &#8220;Bath Rugby is currently addressing the events at the Recreation Ground last week, which involved a small group of players from the club,&#8221; a spokesperson told a local paper. &#8220;The appropriate conduct of all players and staff is highly important to the club and disciplinary hearings with those involved will take place in the coming days.&#8221; Blackadder dropped at least seven players in last weekend&#8217;s game against Gloucester.
