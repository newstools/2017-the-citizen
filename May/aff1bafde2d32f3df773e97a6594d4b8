The Lions were so dominant at the weekend that they easily beat the Kings despite playing with only 14 men. It&#8217;s little wonder then that they are also the key contributor to our Super Rugby team of the week. But to add a little sprinkling of variety, a few stalwarts from the others are also rewarded. 15 &#8211; Andries Coetzee (Lions) The consistent fullback showed why he&#8217;s been included in the Springbok squad by delivering another performance brimming with attacking intent. He ran an astonishing 173m, beating 7 defenders in the process and making 3 clean breaks. 14 &#8211; Cheslin Kolbe (Stormers) The little winger was a standout performer in a very game for the Capetonians. He was the one man to consistently trouble a tight Sharks defence and defended bravely. 13 &#8211; Lionel Mapoe (Lions) He was, naturally, a huge presence on the attack and sometimes glided through gaps with the greatest of ease. However, Mapoe was a revelation as a defender against the Kings, completing an immense 14 tackles and even creating a turnover. 12 &#8211; Burger Odendaal (Bulls) Is this consistent performer being punished by not being selected for any of the national side because he&#8217;s playing in a struggling side? 11 &#8211; S&#8217;bu Nkosi (Sharks) A new star has been born. The former Junior Springbok&#8217;s stock keeps rising as he not only scored a beautiful individual try but showed a big appetite for work. That&#8217;s essential for any modern winger. 10 &#8211; Elton Jantjies (Lions) It says much for his maturity this season that he hasn&#8217;t played a bag game in ages. 9 &#8211; Cobus Reinach (Sharks) He controlled play well by varying his tactics. 8 &#8211; Warren Whiteley (Lions) The new Bok captain was his reliable self and kept his troops composed after Robbie Coetzee&#8217;s red card. Immovable on defence once again. 7 &#8211; Oupa Mohoje (Cheetahs) For once, he didn&#8217;t only have to show off his stern defending but was allowed to show his more creative abilities too. 6 &#8211; Kwagga Smith (Lions) What a magnificent performance from the Blitzboks star. The diminutive flanker was absolutely everywhere, running 135m to score two tries and making an incredible 18 tackles. And don&#8217;t forget what a menace he was at the breakdowns. 5 &#8211; Franco Mostert (Lions) It&#8217;s surely official now: he&#8217;s the best lock in this year&#8217;s tournament. 4 &#8211; Ruan Botha (Sharks) He was a big presence in the collisions, providing the grunt any side needs against the type of lock pairing the Stormers boasts. 3 &#8211; Ruan Dreyer (Lions) He&#8217;s helped cushioned the blow of losing Julian Redelinghuys to such an extent that he&#8217;s not even missed anymore. Scrummed well, ran freely and made 11 tackles. 2 &#8211; Malcolm Marx (Lions) Wow is the only word to describe his performance. The Bok hooker came on for just over 40 minutes after his side&#8217;s red card and flourished. He almost immediately scored a try, pierced a gap, made 8 tackles and created 4 turnovers. Who needs a fetcher if you have this man? 1 &#8211; Jacques van Rooyen (Lions) He&#8217;s really come into his own this season after a slow(ish) start. Click here for last week&#8217;s XV.
