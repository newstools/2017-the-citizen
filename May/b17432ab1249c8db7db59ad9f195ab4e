I think it s too early to feel anything really except to respect the voices that say those things he said. And those comrades are entitled to be nominated as much as I am entitled to be nominated for the position none of us is more important than the other for the organisation and we should humble ourselves. The nominations will start around June and these are not total nominations as such but states of intentions of minds of people and one must respect that. There is vibrancy about our democracy within the party and we should welcome that. Phosa said he believed that he stood a chance and because he s an old member of ANC serving underground and everywhere in my youth like the others, and no sacrifice is more important,&#8221; he said during an interview with eNCA on Tuesday. Phosa is confident that he would be a great president, however, he says that the position was not necessarily one that he wanted very badly right now. He is a loyal member of the ANC and it will not die under my nose , he said. I can t let the work of Luthuli Mandela and many others go into ashes because we want to feed a few greedy people seriously.
