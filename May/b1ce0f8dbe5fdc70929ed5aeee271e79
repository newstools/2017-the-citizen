EFF leader Julius Malema has expressed sadness over the news of Karabo Mokoena, a young woman who went missing two weeks ago, and was found killed and burned, allegedly by a man close to her. Taking to social media, Malema said today was a sad day for the country, especially for young women, who lived in fear of the men around them. Following the announcement of the death, the hashtag #MenAreTrash has been trending since, with women sharing stories of how they suffered abuse at the hands of the same men who promised to protect them. &#8220;Today I&#8217;m not proud to be South African man. RIPKarabo,&#8221; he said, reacting to the stories shared on social media. His party has released a statement, condemning the brutal murder and daily violence against women. &#8220;There is indeed no other way to explain this tragedy than to point to the dominant and violent patriarchal order in South Africa. Men have grown accustomed to the violent abuse and murder of women. Only a culture that hates women would treat them with so much disdain and violence. &#8220;It is a sad day indeed for young women in South Africa today. Fear of men increases, because from total strangers they meet on the streets and taxi ranks, to the loved ones who share intimate spaces with them; there is no safety,&#8221; it said. The party sent its condolences to Karabo&#8217;s family and friends, further calling on the state to deny her killer bail. &#8220;We call on the state to ensure that the killer of Karabo Mokoena does not get bail, and that he rots in jail.&#8221; Karabo went missing on April 28th, and the announcement of her death was made on Thursday morning by her father. He alleged that a man close to her confessed to killing and burning his daughter. The man has since been arrested in connection with the murder.
