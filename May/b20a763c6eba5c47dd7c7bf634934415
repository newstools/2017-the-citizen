It&#8217;s probably not surprising that an upcoming Stormers team has struggled on their tour to New Zealand. Yet what has been striking is the margins they&#8217;ve lost by. Robbie Fleck&#8217;s troops have conceded a massive 114 points, leaking 17 tries in the process.

A lot of the blame has been laid at defence coach Paul Treu&#8217;s door. The former Blitzboks mentor is still relatively new to 15-man rugby, having been appointed before 2015&#8217;s campaign. For some, that&#8217;s enough time. But Fleck is adamant Treu isn&#8217;t at fault. &#8220;What people forget is that a team&#8217;s defence is a complex system of different factors,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not just about a structure, it also needs to be executed by players. And that brings other things into play.&#8221; Instead, the Stormers&#8217; individual errors &#8211; especially on the attack &#8211; has placed them under pressure. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been making silly errors where we should&#8217;ve been in control,&#8221; said Fleck. &#8220;We&#8217;ve conceded points because of our own mistakes. It&#8217;s happened when we&#8217;ve coughed up possession on the attack or made a poor exit. It&#8217;s not always been the opposition that&#8217;s put us under pressure, rather our own turnovers.&#8221; Nobody really expects the Stormers to fare much better against a Hurricanes team that&#8217;s scored 56 tries to date. However, it&#8217;s only natural to ask if there&#8217;s at least something being done about it. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been playing against quality opposition and we&#8217;ve definitely had to plug the gaps,&#8221; said Fleck. &#8220;We work on our defence daily and we always get tested. We&#8217;re doing our best but it&#8217;s not easy always to identify what exactly is going wrong.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
