African Night Sky,raised five points for his win in the Winter Guineas last Saturday, will have to give 1kg all round in the Highlands Stud Winter Classic over 1800m at Kenilworth on Sunday 21 May. The Justin Snaith-trained gelding is the only Graded winner among the 16 entries for the three year- old Grade 3 and is second only to Newlands on official merit ratings. He is not well drawn at No 12 but the draw should not be of that much significance over this distance. Eleven of the 14 who ran in the Winter Guineas have been nominated again including second placed Our Mate Art, Loadshedder (third) and Perovskia (fourth). Turbulent Air, who started favourite but only managed fifth, may also try again. He was not striding out freely according to rider Anton Marcus although the veterinary examination ordered by the stipes failed to show anything wrong. Elevated is also to go again despite disappointing badly and trailing in 11th. Trainer Riaan van Reenen said that nothing went right and he is hoping for rain in the next fortnight. Three of the last four Winter Guineas winners went on to take the Classic and two of them started favourite. It is generally in the Winter Derby where the upsets occur, largely because of the significantly extra distance. As in the Guineas it is the Bass stable which has the best record, winning three of the last six runnings and six of the last 14. The winner of all three legs will collect a R250,000 bonus and Jonathan Snaith is talking of a possible tilt at next year s Sun Met with African Night Sky. Those horses who run in both the Winter Guineas and Classic will not have to pay any entry or declaration fees for the Winter Derby. There is a supplementary entry stage tomorrow with declarations on Monday.
