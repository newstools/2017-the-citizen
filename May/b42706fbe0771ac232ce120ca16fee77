In an official statement, the Guptas said the reports were intended to influence political perception which was &#8216;an example of fake news.&#8217; The family&#8217;s lawyer, Gert van der Merwe urged the publications who ran with the articles to submit the email evidence to his clients for consideration. City Press and Sunday Times both ran reports relying on explosive emails and letters showing how the Guptas were consulted in the appointment of Mosebenzi Zwane to head the portfolio of mineral resources. His CV was sent to the Guptas a month before his promotion to the powerful post. In addition, a letter circulated by Duduzane Zuma and Tony Gupta addressed to senior officials in the United Arab Emirates suggest president Jacob Zuma wanted residency for himself and his family. The emails also implicate several ministers and politicians, showing how they were influenced by the Guptas and coached by them in responding to media queries. &#8220;Once the documents are studied and verified, my client will be in a position to comment if justified. The family deny any wrongdoing or paying any amounts to ministers or the President and reserve its rights,&#8221; the statement concluded.
