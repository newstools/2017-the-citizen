Choreographer and presenter Somizi Mhlongo has apologised to Bulelwa &#8216;Zahara&#8217; Mkutukana after a joke that left a sour taste in her mouth. On Saturday night at the Samas, held at Sun City, Somizi asked the audience if Zahara was already at the bar, referring to reports last year about her being an alcoholic. Though she was not there, Zahara was told about the joke, and threatened to sue Somizi or the Samas should they not apologise to her. I only wish what I heard upon my return from Swaziland #BushfireFestival this past weekend about what Somizi said at the Samas is not true! Because if he did, I am suing Somizi and the Samas for defamation of character. I am tired of this, she wrote on Instagram. Now Somizi has apologised to the Country Girl hit maker, saying though he only mentioned her name and a bar and not alcohol, he was still sorry if the joke offended her. &#8220;I did not mean to hurt or harm her. It was just a joke,&#8221; he was quoted as saying by The Sowetan. Also read: Zahara threatens to sue Somizi and Samas
