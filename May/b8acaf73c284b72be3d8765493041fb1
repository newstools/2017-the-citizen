Contrary to what certain people think, assembling an international team is not about picking the best players. Well, not always. Rugby, because of all its injuries, is a sport where a coach invariably needs to pick the best players at his disposal. There&#8217;s an important difference here. Also read: The usual suspects dominate our Super Rugby XV for the week Springbok coach Allister Coetzee is in this position with his flyhalves before next month&#8217;s series against France. We all know Lions pivot Elton Jantjies is the first choice candidate to wear the No 10 jersey and rightfully so. He&#8217;s been solid this season and played in 9 Tests last year. However, when you mention a deputy for him, the waters become muddy. Handre Pollard injured his ankle a few weeks back and is only expected to return after the French visit, while Pat Lambie&#8217;s future is in doubt after he sustained concussion again at the weekend. Given Lambie&#8217;s long battle with it last year, there must be fears for his long-term health. As a result, an unlikely name has popped up: Kings skipper Lionel Cronje. It&#8217;s a pretty crazy story. The 27-year-old journeyman has been at the Stormers, Bulls, Lions, Sharks and Brumbies. He didn&#8217;t make a mark at any of those sides. Unsurprisingly, many chuckled when Cronje was plucked from obscurity to play for the Kings in Super Rugby this year. But he has responded magnificently &#8211; kicking superbly, breaking the line frequently and dazzling fans with his distribution. Should we be surprised? Yes and no. Cronje was somewhat of a prodigy at age-group level and a Junior Springbok. The fact that so many prominent sides took a chance on him previously also suggests they saw something in him. Cronje certainly can&#8217;t be considered a world-beater. In fact, we can&#8217;t be sure if the man from Bloemfontein has suddenly realised his hidden talent or if he&#8217;s merely having the season of his life. However, it&#8217;s crucial that he be included in the Bok group and there&#8217;s a very simple reason for that. Coetzee is in a position where short-term results matter. The axe is, apparently, still hanging over him and needs to win the series against France to secure his future. Surely then it&#8217;s only rational to pick South Africa&#8217;s only red-hot flyhalf in Super Rugby to date? One can never underestimate the short-term benefits of picking a player who&#8217;s in the form of his life. So, even if Cronje is only part of a national squad for three Tests his entire career, it would still be worth it. Picking him isn&#8217;t cheapening the Bok jersey. It will be about making due with what&#8217;s at your disposal.
