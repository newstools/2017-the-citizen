Mariam Nabatanzi, a 37-year-old woman from Kabimbiri village in Uganda, has been dubbed &#8220;the most fertile woman&#8221; after she has been reported to have 38 children, all from the same man. The woman has 38 children, including four sets of triplets, three sets of quadruplets and twins aged between five months and 23 years old. According to documentarian Kassim Kayira, Nabatanzi was married off when she was 13 and bore 44 kids in total, but lost six. Joy Doreen BIIRA on Twitter said Nabatanzi&#8217;s first births were four pairs of twins. She then went to the doctors worried that her fertility would kill her. However, doctors could not help her. She then fell pregnant three times with quintuplets and then again with three sets of quadruplets. Following that, she fell pregnant over and again with twins. The gap between each set of births is 1.8 years, said Joy Doreen BIIRA . All her births were apparently natural, and all children have the same father, who has since allegedly vanished, leaving the woman to deal with burden of raising the children. &#8220;Her village mates believe she&#8217;s the most fertile woman in Uganda,&#8221; said Joy Doreen BIIRA.
