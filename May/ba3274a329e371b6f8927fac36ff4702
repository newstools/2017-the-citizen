TS record label owners and business partners Sbusiso Sbu Leope and Thembinkosi TK Nciza have ended their business relationship. TK resigned from his role as director at Mofaya and is no longer a part of TS records. &#8220;I can confirm that I have not been active in TS Records business affairs for a while, but it was not because TK and I fought. We are still OK as brothers. It&#8217;s just that he wanted to concentrate on his political career and grow his other business ventures, and I also wanted to concentrate on growing Mofaya,&#8221; Dj Sbu told Sunday World. The publication reported that the record label had not submitted their annual for more than five years, and so the South African Companies and Intellectual Property Commission has deregistered the record label. Daily Sun reported that Zahara also left the company to form her own, following Nhlanhla Nciza, who also left to start her own record label. &nbsp; ALSO READ: Zahara fails to pay monthly instalments for Audi A5 report For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
