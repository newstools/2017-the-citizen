Kick It Out, an anti-discrimination group in Britain, has slammed Italy&#8217;s football administrators for being &#8220;gutless&#8221; after they banned Sulley Muntari for taking a stand against racism. The Ghanaian midfielder, who plays for Pescara, left the field in stoppage time during last weekend&#8217;s Serie A meeting with Cagliari. Muntari had been subjected to racist abuse from Cagliari fans throughout the game. The 32-year-old was so fed up eventually that Pescara had to play without him for the last two minutes. He was shown a second yellow card for &#8220;leaving the field without permission&#8221;. Bafflingly, a Serie A disciplinary committee handed him a one-match ban but didn&#8217;t even give a warning to Cagliari over its fans. The committee said the racist remarks were &#8220;deplorable&#8221; yet they couldn&#8217;t fine the club because &#8220;only 10 fans were involved&#8221;. That number is apparently too small to punish a club. &#8220;We have made a representation to FIFPro, the World Players Union, to share its frustrations about the treatment of Sulley Muntari by the FIGC (the Italian Football Federation),&#8221; Kick It Out said in a statement. &#8220;The gutless failure to not take action by the Italian authorities should not be allowed to pass. It s unbelievable that Cagliari escaped punishment as only 10 fans were involved. This situation should never be allowed to happen again.&#8221; Former Tottenham legend Garth Crooks, who is an independent trustee of the organisation, called for radical action from black players in Serie A. &#8220;Every self-respecting black player in the Italian League should not play this weekend unless the Italian authorities withdraw the ban on Sulley Muntari,&#8221; he was quoted as saying. Muntari was a key player for Ghana in 2010&#8217;s World Cup in South Africa, where he scored a wonder goal in the quarterfinal against Uruguay.
