If the Proteas are going to continue getting the best out of Quinton de Kock, he&#8217;ll need to be shielded from the public eye. Russell Domingo, South Africa&#8217;s coach, admits team management are very conscious of too much pressure being heaped on the exciting wicketkeeper-batsman for the ICC Champions Trophy and tour of England. Also read: WATCH: Quinton de Kock named Cricketer of the Year De Kock&#8217;s massive worth to the side&#8217;s cause was illustrated by him walking away with six accolades at Cricket South Africa&#8217;s annual awards ceremony last weekend. That haul included being named SA Cricketer of the Year. &#8220;Managing Quinton is going to be massively important for us,&#8221; said Domingo on Tuesday, shortly before the Proteas departed for the United Kingdom. &#8220;He&#8217;s a guy who doesn&#8217;t like these type of things (media conferences and engagements).We&#8217;ve got to try and keep him away from the public spotlight as much as possible. We must avoid unnecessary engagements with him.&#8221; Indeed, De Kock has never been known as much of a talker and tends to keep his thoughts simple and to-the-point. Following his successful night in Kyalami last Saturday, the 24-year-old showed again that he&#8217;s rather a doer &#8211; as more than 1800 international runs this season attests to. &#8220;I really don t want to say too much about the Champions Trophy,&#8221; said De Kock. &#8220;I don t want to jinx myself or jinx the team. We just want to be that team who go there and do our best.&#8221; Little wonder then Domingo is unapologetic about the potentially limited access the cricketing fraternity might have of him. &#8220;We need to free him up on the days when we can,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Quinton is the type of guy who likes having some time by himself. We need to give him that.&#8221; Of course, there&#8217;s also the incentive that leaving De Kock to mind his own could produce even more spectacular results. &#8220;He&#8217;ll be the first to admit that he hasn&#8217;t done well at a world tournament yet,&#8221; said Domingo. &#8220;In the 2015 World Cup he did perform below expectations and is keen to make up for that. It&#8217;s an exciting thought.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
