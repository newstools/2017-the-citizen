A 39-year-old man was airlifted to hospital after he was shot during an apparent robbery in Mamelodi, east of Pretoria on Wednesday, paramedics said. Netcare 911 spokesperson Nick Dollman said reports from the scene allege that men had attacked a courier vehicle resulting in the shooting. The exact details around the incident would form part of the police investigation. Paramedics attended to a 39-year-old male victim who had been shot, he was in a critical condition and was placed on a ventilator by the advanced life support paramedic at the scene. Due to the severity of his injuries, the Netcare 911 air ambulance was called to the scene and landed in an open field at a nearby university. The victim was airlifted to an awaiting specialised trauma centre in Johannesburg for further urgent care, he said. ER24 said the man was shot in the chest.
