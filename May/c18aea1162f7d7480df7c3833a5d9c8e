A blackmailer threatened to kill the children of stricken Formula One legend Michael Schumacher unless paid $1 million. The man, who cannot be named, has been ordered to seek psychiatric help and a German court also handed him a suspended jail sentence, a fine and 50 hours of community service. &#8220;If the money doesn&#8217;t reach us by March 31, 2016, your children will be killed in some way. In Formula Four, many accidents occur,&#8221; wrote the 25-year-old in a chilling email to Schumacher&#8217;s wife in February 2016. Schumacher&#8217;s son Mick, 18, now competes in Formula Three but was racing for a Formula Four team at the time. His daughter Gina-Maria, 20, has a successful riding career. Police were easily able to trace the blackmailer after he included his bank details in the email to Schumacher&#8217;s wife Corinna. &#8220;To put it cautiously, giving your own bank account details is not sensible,&#8221; judge Eberhard Hausch told a court in the city of Reutlingen. The convicted man&#8217;s lawyer said his client &#8220;can&#8217;t until this day explain why&#8221; he acted as he did. Schumacher, 48, who won seven world titles during his racing career, is recovering at his Swiss home from a serious head injury he suffered in a skiing accident in December 2013. His family and manager have given no details of his condition. For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
