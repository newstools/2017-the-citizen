Cassper got a large dose of karma and it left him eating humble pie and pining after Boity, who he was madly in love with but broke-up with because he cheated on her. While Cassper doesn&#8217;t name the woman who left him for a businessman in the song Destiny, which features international R&amp;B star Goapele, he does chronicle how their love affair came to an abrupt and sad end. During an album listening session last week, a few days before dropping Thuto, Cassper said he had broken someone&#8217;s heart, apparently referring to Boity, and that his heart was also broken by the new girl he met after dating her.

Both of them have since deleted the pics and videos. Cassper and Lizelle in happier times On the track, Cassper raps that he saw a future with the lady who broke his heart and that she had him doing dinner dates and things he wasn&#8217;t used too. He mentions how he was somewhat embarrassed to claim her as his girl, because he was concerned about what his friends and fans would say about her. Their relationship turned sour when Cassper found out she had partied with his enemies. I&#8217;ve heard a lot of things about you and I know half of it is true/Don&#8217;t try and act innocent like you ain&#8217;t done some wicked shit/I&#8217;m still here treating you like I&#8217;m your first pretending that loving you could never hurt/It&#8217;s crazy because we were done before I finished this/I never should have trusted that you innocent/ Cause now you out here leaving me for a businessman/How am I supposed to believe you were genuine? &#8220;This song is an actual true story about someone who broke my heart&#8230; I think it&#8217;s about telling true stories that people can relate to,&#8221; said Cassper about the song.
