It now makes sense why BMW quietly stopped making the 6 Series Coupe. Reason why I say this is that in 2013 (if you remember well) at the Concorso d Eleganza Villa d Este, BMW revealed the stunning Gran Lusso Coupe concept to ignite rumours about a possible return of the legendary 8 Series moniker. Fast forward to the year 2017, the folks at BMW are taking a step closer to a production model by introducing the appropriately called 8 Series Coupe Concept , however, the full reveal is scheduled for May 26 when we will get an accurate picture of what to expect from the road-going model. What is visible on the teaser image is a sleek side profile with a raked roofline and wide rear hips ending with a prominent trunk lid spoiler. If the aforementioned Gran Lusso Coupe pictured below is any indication, this near-production concept will be drop-dead gorgeous and hopefully the final car will follow suit. According to BMW, this is a design study that provides a preview for the production model scheduled to go on sale in 2018. When it arrives, it will command a significant premium over the 7 Series given its flagship status. Speaking of the 7 Series, the new crown jewel in BMW s growing line-up will likely be largely based on the full-size sedan from where it will inherit the higher-end engines, all the way up to a V12 as it would be appropriate for a posh grand tourer. The coupe might be only the tip of the iceberg as gossip indicates there are also plans for an 8 Series Gran Coupe and even an M8, but we ll have to wait and see whether these rumours will pan out. One thing is for sure, the Mercedes S-Class Coupe will have to face a new rival. With rumours of a possible Audi A9 due in a few years, the battle is heating up in the niche of big and luxurious coupes.
