The South African Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) on Monday called for applications from companies to take part in a trade and investment mission to Zambia from July 26-28. Zambia is one of South Africa s top five trade partners in the SADC region, with total trade between the countries amounting to R33 billion in 2016. The DTI said the mission was aimed at advancing commitments made between the two countries heads of state in December during Zambian President Edgar Lungu s visit to South Africa. The two presidents agreed to deepen bilateral trade and investment relations. The mission will present an ideal platform for South African companies who would like to export value-added products and services, as well as companies which are looking for investment opportunities and joint-venture partnerships in Zambia, the statement said. The Minister of Trade and Industry, Dr Rob Davies, said the mission would enable South African companies to interact with leading private sector entities from agro-processing, agribusiness, infrastructure, advanced manufacturing, energy, tourism, mining and capital equipment, and others. South Africa remains committed to the regional integration agenda as espoused in Agenda 2063, Davies said. Platforms of this nature afford us the opportunity to not only consolidate political ties, but also to create the much needed value chains, skills and technology transfer and employment generation required to give effect to our economic ambitions.
