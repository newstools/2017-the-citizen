Up in the top-end where sophisticated and rather quick little hatches live, there s always been a tough competition between the Volkswagen Polo GTI, Ford Fiesta ST, Renault Clio RS and the unforgettable Peugeot 208 GTi. . The Ford Fiesta is among the list of choices people often look at when looking to buy a car. Being one of SA s favourate little hatch, Ford introduces a special edition makeover model dubbed ST200, however, only 160 of these are finding homes on our land. Starting with the outside, the ST200 (or 200hp, hence the ST200 designation) sets itself apart from the standard Fiesta ST with a unique Storm Grey metallic. The model also rides on unique matte black 17-inch five-spoke alloy wheels that frame red front and rear brake callipers. It also gets rear LED tail lamps and exclusive ST200 exterior and interior badging. . Jumping into the cabin, the ST200 s premium Recaro heated sport seats with partial leather welcome you. This is complemented by dual-tone seatbelts, illuminated scuff plates and privacy glass for the rear windows. Reverse parking sensors with an integrated reverse camera are also included. All the standard Fiesta ST s features remain part of the package, including SYNC with Bluetooth and Voice Control, Ford MyKey, remote central locking with keyless entry and start, climate control, as well as seven airbags including a driver s knee airbag. Ford has managed to add more grunt to the 1.6-litre EcoBoost turbocharged petrol engine that powers the standard Fiesta ST. Power climbs from 134kW to 149kW (or 200hp, hence the ST200 designation). . Maximum torque jumps from the standard car s 240Nm to 290Nm. A further 11kW and 30Nm are available for up to 20 seconds using the engine s transient overboost. All that power is sent to the front wheels via an improved quick-shifting six-speed manual transmission enabling the hatch to dash from 0-100km/h in 6.7 seconds. Ford claims the ST200 takes 5.2 sec to blast from 50 to 100km/h in fourth gear, while the top speed is electronically limited to 230km/h. The exclusive, limited edition Ford Fiesta ST200 carries a recommended retail price of R339 900 (including VAT). . This includes the standard Ford Protect four-year/120 000km comprehensive warranty, four-year/60 000km service plan, five-year unlimited distance corrosion warranty, and three-year unlimited distance Ford Roadside Assistance. Service intervals are every 15 000km.
