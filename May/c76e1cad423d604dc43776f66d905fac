AB de Villiers is not concerned about his form going into the ICC Champions Trophy. The Proteas one-day skipper had a distinctly lukewarm campaign in the Indian Premier League (IPL), scoring only one fifty in 9 innings. &#8220;I&#8217;m not worried. I hope others also aren&#8217;t worried,&#8221; said De Villiers. Also read: How the Proteas will deal with their baby boom &#8220;I had a few decent knocks. It was split up nicely across the tournament. I made a fifty early on and then another good score later on.&#8221; Sceptics might find those words hard to believe given the 33-year-old&#8217;s inconsistent scores but it must also be said he played in a Bangalore batting line-up that gradually badly lost confidence. &#8220;I always felt in good form,&#8221; said De Villiers. &#8220;I&#8217;m really not too worried, I&#8217;m really excited. I&#8217;m hitting the ball as well as ever. I think there are some good scores to come.&#8221; South Africa&#8217;s middle-order dynamo also had some fans nervous over a troublesome back, a niggle that saw him sit out twice during the tournament. But careful management by his IPL franchise means De Villiers is fit as a fiddle. &#8220;My back&#8217;s 100%. I&#8217;ve worked really hard on that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s always been a bit of an issue, especially the past 7 or 8 years. I&#8217;m 33, it&#8217;s part and parcel of the game.&#8221; Perhaps then the biggest issue is in which position will De Villiers have the biggest impact. Given that English conditions are expected to see a few top order wickets fall early, the trick for the Proteas will be to carefully decide whether to use him earlier of later. Not that De Villiers minds being a so-called floater in the batting order. &#8220;The last while I&#8217;ve been batting at No 4,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m very happy to move around the order. I always have been. I&#8217;m not a big stats man, so I won&#8217;t look at what my averages are in different positions. If it suits them team for me to bat 3 or 5, for example, I&#8217;ll do it.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
