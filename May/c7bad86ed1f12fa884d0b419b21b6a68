A road safety campaign called #SlowDown_Save livesZA will kick-start today at 9am with a motorcade from Phumulani Mall, Tembisa, to Vosloorus Stadium in Ekurhuleni. The motorcade will attract bikers, cyclists, car spinners, drifters, racers, scholar transport and taxi associations. They will drive to Vosloorus Stadium to participate in a Top 4 soccer and netball tournament. The #SlowDown_Save livesZA day is hosted by Road Traffic Infringement Agency (RTIA), in partnership with the City of Ekurhuleni and Kasi Road Safety. Deputy Minister of Transport Sindisiwe Chikunga, and Gauteng Province MEC for Community Safety Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane will attend. Spokesperson for RTIA Monde Mkalipi said the event aims to encourage motorists to #Slowdown and observe speed limits on the road. Speed is a contributing factor in most crashes. Drivers travelling at high speed vehicles are more likely to be injured in both front and side impact collisions. The relationship between speed and injury severity is particularly dire to vulnerable road users such as pedestrians, cyclists, children and the elderly, said Mkalipi. The fourth United Nations Global Road Safety Week kicked off on Monday worldwide. The theme is #SlowDown_Save Lives. The week focuses on reducing speed and finding intervention measures to address key risk factors, said Mkalipi.
