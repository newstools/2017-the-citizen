Three people were killed Wednesday when a jeep sped out of control through a crowd of several hundred people at a US carauction in Massachusetts, officials said. Nine other people were hospitalised &#8212; including two with life-threatening injuries &#8212; after the warehouse crash at Lynnway Auto Auction, a used car dealership in Billerica, just over 20 miles (35 kilometers) north of Boston. &#8220;The preliminary information we have right now suggests that this is a tragic accident,&#8221; Middlesex District Attorney Marian Ryan told reporters. &#8220;At about 10:13 this morning police received a call of a vehicle that had gone out of control,&#8221; she said. Several hundred customers and staff had gathered for the weekly auction, where employees drive cars up and down lanes to be viewed for sale. A Jeep Grand Cherokee &#8220;suddenly accelerated and traveled through the building at high speed,&#8221; said Ryan. It struck members of the crowd before crashing into a cinder block wall at the far end of the warehouse. &#8220;One male and two females have died as a result of their injuries,&#8221; said Ryan. Nine other people were being treated at a hospital, including two with life-threatening injuries, she added. The driver is a man in his 70s who works for the company. Reports suggested that he may have suffered a medical emergency, but Ryan said he was not hospitalized. Massachusetts State Police said earlier there was &#8220;no evidence or information to suggest the incident was caused by an intentional or terrorist act.&#8221; &#8220;All evidence and information at this time suggests an accidental cause.&#8221; jm/mdo Agence France-Presse 3 people killed and 10 others injured from what is believed to be an accidental car crash at an auto auction in MA. https://t.co/rqWtcm7ckN pic.twitter.com/IEaGo1d6A8 &mdash; ABC News (@ABC) May 3, 2017 For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
