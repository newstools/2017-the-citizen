Tales from my own experience tell that malaria cases are more suspected than their actual presence.What I mean by this, is that the number of people tested for malaria after being suspected to suffer from it is more than the number of real malaria cases.On this side of the planet, the situation is daunting since the patients themselves come from home with a self-made diagnosis. They go to the hospital just to confirm and at times they just get over-the-counter medication.I ve heard patients say, Nimekuja kupima malaria, kwani nina dalili zote za malaria , (I have to test for malaria because I have all its important symptoms).Some patients even become furious if you ask them further questions because they are adamant that their diagnosis is right.It was also once noted by researchers that 10-12 million people contract malaria in Tanzania and 80,000 die from the disease, and most of them are children. Hence, the malaria scare among people.However, it said that in the last years the number of children dying from malaria has halved.How do doctors react?Early diagnosis of malaria reduces the disease and prevents death. With the help of rapid diagnostic tools in Tanzania (MRDT) early detection of the disease is possible, however in some of the places microscopic tests (blood slide for malaria) can be done, which can be a better option.A lot of health centers and dispensaries do not perform microscopic test.One of the patient railed against the results and claimed, kila nikipima malaria sina, ila nikienda hospitali nyingine nakuwa nayo, sijui vipimo vyao vibovu? (Every time I test for malaria, the results are negative but when I get checked somewhere else I get positive results, maybe their diagnostic equipments are defective).This assertion is due to self-made diagnosis by the patient, however, there are challenges in diagnosing malaria.In a lot of health facilities in Tanzania the screening test MRDT is the most commonly used screen tool and is the basis of decision making in malaria treatment.In addition, at times, clinical diagnosis is the approach that is being used in a multitude of places in Tanzania despite the fact that it is vitiated by misconceptions. Yet it remains the basis of therapeutic care for majority of patients presenting with fever in malarious areas in Tanzania, especially where laboratory support is out of reach.It is the least expensive approach and is the basis of self-treatment in Tanzania, however, the overlapping of malaria symptoms with other tropical diseases reduces its specificity index and therefore it encourages the inordinate use of antimalarials.That s why in Tanzania, there is a trendy clinical aphorism which says, sio kila homa ni malaria (It is not that every kind of fever points to malaria). This saying discourages the self-treatment, as well as self-diagnosis approaches.Doctors in Tanzania do discourage the thinking that every individual with fever is ipso facto to have malaria!The so called Mseto In Tanzania, the very reknowned medication is Mseto , which is a Swahili version for ALU (Artmether Lumefantrine), a widely used drug by those who opt for self-prescription.Though the use of quinine is losing ground in towns, it s no wonder that it s still the only option in first trimester pregnancy due to its proven safety in pregnancy at that point in time.But it is still being used in rural areas as a routine antimalarial interchangeably with ALU for severe and uncomplicated form of malaria.You will hear another client saying that nilijisikia nina malaria kabisa hivyo nikanywa metakefin , (I really felt like I had been suffering from malaria, thus I had to take in metakelfin .Most people in Tanzania especially in towns do like this drug [metakelfin] because they take it as a single dose, they trust it and love it a lot.I personally do not prescribe this drug. Tanzania standard treatment guideline (STG published in 2015) advocate the use of ALU, Quinine, Artmether, and Artisunate, SP during pregnancy as part of ANC.Will Malaria hinder Tanzania to reach the tiger economy?A Nobel prize laureate in medicine, T.H Weller, once said, It has been recognised that a malarious community is an impoverished community. In my view I have found that Africa is the home of malaria; The only part of Africa free of malaria are the southern and northern extremes which have the richest countries on the continent.In India, a country with the greatest number of poor people in the world has a serious malaria problem. Haiti has the worst malaria in the western hemisphere, and it is the poorest country in the hemisphere.How about Tanzania? It being a malarious land, reaching the tiger economy might be a bit of an arduous task. I would assert that poor countries predominate in the same regions as malaria, while the richest countries are outside the bounds of intensive malaria.Is there any progress?Despite the horrifying past statistics, in my view, I find that we have much headway in terms of treatment and reduction of mortality from malaria.I don t even remember when I last certified a death due to malaria, but I m told that there are still many who die from the disease.So does that mean that we have achieved the Abuja declaration on malaria? Are there any prospects to expedite the task?At one time, Tanzania adopted the 5-years strategic plan, which was advocating four main approaches in the fight against malaria namely, improved case management, vector control using insecticides treated mosquito nets, prevention and control of malaria in pregnancy and epidemic preparedness and prevention and control.Well, locally the availability of MRDTs , increased public awareness, the free distribution and use of insecticides-treated mosquito nets altogether has helped in tackling the challenge.In my opinion, I also find that the NHIF (National Health Insurance Fund) has also played a big role since it has capacitated the people to get medication/ anti-malarias, even the expensive ones from the health centre level. Example, an artesunate injection, the price for a single 120mg vial is usually sold at Sh15,000, while with NHIF can be available for Sh8,500.The author is a medical doctor, public health activist and a researcher based in Dar es Salaam.
