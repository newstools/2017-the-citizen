Former Councillor Ronaldo Meyer is facing charges of animal cruelty. The well-known businessman recently appeared in Bizana Magistrate s Court in KwaZulu-Natal and is expected to appear again next month, South Coast Herald reported. Last September, Kloof and Highway SPCA, together with the Lower South Coast SPCA, confiscated two pitbulls from the Meyer s property in the Eastern Cape after he failed to comply with warnings to rectify the poor living conditions of the dogs. He was later charged with animal cruelty under the Animal Protection Act No 71 of 1962. The SPCA inspectors and veterinarian inspects one of the chained dogs on Ronaldo Meyer s property. The Lower South Coast SPCA had initially reacted to a tip-off they received from the community and, after an inspection, they discovered several pitbulls chained at various points on the perimeter of the property, living in harsh and inhumane conditions. During many inspections to the property, conducted by staff of the SPCA, it was reported that some of dogs were unable to access water or food. In some cases, empty water bowls were found to be placed strategically out of reach of the chained animal. Most of the dogs were found to be living without adequate shelter or shade and had hay as bedding. Visible scarring (and fresh bite wounds) on the bodies of the animals were reported. The dogs were underweight and in need of veterinarian treatment. One of inspections by the SPCA found the boerboel-cross-staffie to be no longer on the premises as it had apparently been given to a friend . One of the two pitbulls confiscated by the SPCA from Ronaldo Meyer&#8217;s property. Meyer told the SPCA staff that he had received the dogs from different friends since he could not afford to buy dogs. He was given the dogs when they were no longer needed for their intended purpose. &#8211; Caxton News Service For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter
