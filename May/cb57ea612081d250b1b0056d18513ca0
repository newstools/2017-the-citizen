Sushi King and businessman Kenny Kunene recently pulled a &#8216;DJ Khaled&#8217; on his son, Remo Mokgethwa, and posted a video of him talking to the infant. He tells his son how great he already is and that he is intelligent, clever and blessed. As he continues to feed the infant, he tells him to enjoy the milk in a Hugo Boss bottle, which is not sold over the counter in South Africa. While most commended Kunene for speaking positive words to his son, some called him a copycat because DJ Khaled had done the exact same thing. Watch the video below: A post shared by djmahoota (@djmahoota) on May 30, 2017 at 4:21am PDT He says: &#8220;My son Remo, you&#8217;re baby billionaire, you&#8217;re baby boss, you&#8217;re a legend already, you&#8217;re wealthy, you&#8217;re intelligent, you&#8217;re clever, you&#8217;re smart, you think big, you&#8217;re blessed, you&#8217;re anointed, you&#8217;re loved.
