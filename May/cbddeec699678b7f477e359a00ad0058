President Jacob Zuma has accepted the resignation of Judge Mabel Jansen, his office announced on Monday. Jansen tendered her resignation last week after the judicial service commission investigated social media comments she made stating that rape was part of black culture. Justice Jansen was on special leave following comments she made on social media in 2015 which gave rise to a complaint to the Judicial Services Commission (JSC). The JSC was processing the complaint when she tendered her resignation, the Presidency said in a statement. The President has thanked Justice Jansen for her service and wished her well for her future endeavours.
