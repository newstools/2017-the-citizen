It is almost beyond conception that a demented suicidal misfit would target an Ariana Grande pop concert in Manchester where a predominantly teenage audience were sure to bear the brutal brunt. It was 10.33pm when a savage blast of nuts and bolts rained a deadly hail of death over the Manchester Arena where the concert had just finished, claiming the lives of at least 22 and leaving 59 injured. Like the rest of the civilised world, the concept of taking the terror war to the streets and, more especially, placing the kids in the front line is abhorrent as are moving vehicles mowing down innocent civilians, two Islamic fundamentalists hacking off-duty soldier Lee Rigby to death in a London street, or far-right white nationalist Thomas Mair inflicting a fatal stabbing and shooting of Labour MP Jo Cox. It is the worst terror attack to hit Britain since the July 2005 suicide bomb attacks in central London in which 52 people were killed and came four years to the day Rigby was murdered. Along with the many horrified by this bestial act, we consider it a violation of everything that should be held sacred and we are deeply appalled.
