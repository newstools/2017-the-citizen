Gauteng MEC for Roads and Transport Ismail Vadi launched a R444 million project on Tuesday, to upgrade the N14 freeway between Diepsloot and Brakfontein Interchange in Centurion. This is a toll-free project and follows the completion of the first phase of the N14 project from Krugersdorp to Diepsloot, said Vadi. The MEC said that the 21km project would rehabilitate the remaining portion of the N14 freeway that connected Centurion and Krugersdorp. The road also offers alternate routes to the Sandton CBD, Lanseria Airport, and Diepsloot. He said that the N14 was originally constructed in 1978 and had reached the end of its life span. With traffic volumes on the N14 growing at a rate of 3.2 percent per annum, the freeway has seen sharp increases in traffic flows, particularly at peak times, necessitating its upgrade. Vadi indicated that an additional third lane would be added to the freeway to enable ease of mobility during peak times. The department said the project would improve the structural and functional condition of the road by means of strengthening the pavement structure and providing a new asphalt overlay. In addition, new concrete lined drains and subsoil drains will aid in the preservation of the pavement structure and add to the safety of the road user, they said. Additional objectives include the provision of skills development opportunities as well as to provide training and economic empowerment to local contractors. The projects is set to last over the next 24 months and Vadi appealed to motorists to exercise extra caution on the road during the construction period.
