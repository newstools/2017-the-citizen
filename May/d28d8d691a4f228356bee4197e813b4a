Some observers believe the South African Music Awards (Samas) is a dying hype but they could be wrong. Meanwhile, the show goes on. Masses are preparing themselves to hit the road to Bokone Bophirima, North West Province, at the beautiful Sun City Superbowl to witness the 23rd instalment of the prestigious and somewhat controversial awards taking place tonight. Mabala Noise artist and fourtime Metro FM Music Award winner Nasty C has remarkably received six Samas nominations, leaving naysayers questioning the sincerity of the nominations. His debut album, Bad Hair Extensions, earned him nods for consideration in Best Newcomer of the Year, Best Male Artist of the Year, Best Album of the Year and Best Rap Album. Hot on the heels of Nasty C is rapper Kwesta, pictured, with five categories, while new singing sensation Amanda Black has four. According to the organisers, Mzansi can anticipate a fusion of rock and hip-hop to kick off a night of musical brilliance, featuring rap royalty Khuli Chana and Kwesta. The Afro Pop section will provide a noticeably African flavour led by the popular Afro-pop vocalist Kelly Khumalo. Viewers and those attending the event are bound to be kept on their feet as urban maskandi, Afro pop and hip hop acts deliver a mix of sound and beats. Gospel s brightest stars, such as Dr Tumi and Lebo Sekgobela are expected to take to the stage. The CEO of the Recording Industry of South Africa (Risa), Nhlanhla Sibisi, says it is truly promising to see so many young and new artists dominating the list. It promises to be magic. It will be lit. You cannot afford to miss what the creative team has put together, she said. The Samas 23 ceremony will be hosted by Idols SA judge and choreographer Somizi Mhlongo and comedian Tumi Morake.
