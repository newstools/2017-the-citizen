A company linked to President Jacob Zuma&#8217;s adviser on energy, Silas Zimu, has reportedly scored a R149 million contract at Eskom. Cape Gate Marepha, a company at which he is a nonexecutive director was reportedly awarded a contract to to supply Eskom with wiring, just seven months after his appointment, Sunday Times has reported. The discovery was made after notes from auditors conducting an ongoing auditor-general&#8217;s audit reportedly found 12 deals, which total more than R1 billion, done with state employees without declarations. Zimu has been the president&#8217;s adviser since July 2015 and has been a director at the company since 2006. Though Eskom denied that there was an audit underway at the parastatal, Sunday Times claims to have seen the spreadsheets detailing audit progress. The Presidency reportedly said it was not aware of Zimu&#8217;s dealings with Eskom and would &#8220;talk to him&#8221; about it. Zimu reportedly downplayed the issue, saying he was a nonexecutive director at the company and was barely active, further saying he resigned from the company in November, though he had not found the time to submit a resignation letter. Public service regulations prohibit state employees from doing business with the state, advisers were not affected by the regulations, though they still have to declare their interests.
