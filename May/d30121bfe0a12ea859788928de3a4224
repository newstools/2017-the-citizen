The Cheetahs delivered a up-and-down performance in going down 50-32 to the Blues in Auckland on Friday. They&#8217;ll always be a threat on the attack but their defence was wayward again and a lack of composure continues to really hurt them. Who was the star in this match? The Blues back tree flourished in general but it was the attacking instincts and support play of fullback Melani Nanai that was really impressive. He fully deserved his try and switched to the No 15 jersey effectively in this game. Key themes and events As they&#8217;ve done numerous times this season, the Cheetahs started well. Coach Franco Smith has done well in developing his side&#8217;s attacking abilities. They took a early lead through skipper Francois Venter after they kept they ball well for seven phases. Later on, the central franchise also showed their adaptability by scoring from three driving mauls. However, lapses in concentration continues to cost the Cheetahs dearly. Twice early in the first half did they lose their lead because the allowed the Blues to score immediately afterwards. Fullback Melani Nanai&#8217;s brilliant off-load to winger Rieko Ioane led to the hosts&#8217; first try before lock Scott Scrafton immediately bashed over following the Cheetahs&#8217; second try. Smith will constantly remind you that Super Rugby has become a tournament where teams in general leak more tries. That&#8217;s true to an extent. But the Cheetahs&#8217; defensive system is simply too chaotic at times to keep them in games. They had to make 89 tackles but also missed 25. It&#8217;s simply not good enough. The Blues deserved credit for how well they took control in the second half. They dominated possession, defended tightly and their set-pieces worked well.
