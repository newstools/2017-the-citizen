Kenyan challenger Morris Munene Gachaga hopes to overcome a powerful local onslaught led by defending champion Stephen Mokoka at the FNB OneRun 12km road race in Cape Town next week. Gachaga, who beat compatriot Paul Lonyangata in a late sprint in March to win the Paris Half-Marathon in 1:00:38, was included in the elite men&#8217;s field announced on Thursday for the third edition of the annual contest through the streets of the Mother City. &#8220;I know the route is flat, fast and conducive to good racing, so I will make sure I am in good shape come race day,&#8221; Gachaga said in a statement. &#8220;I know it won&#8217;t be easy with Mokoka in the race. He always makes it tough, but I am confident that I can do well.&#8221; Aside from Mokoka, the national 10km and 15km record holder, the line-up also featured former SA half-marathon champion Lucky Mohale, local tack star Elroy Gelant, in-form Namakoe Nkhasi of Lesotho, and Ethiopian teenager Walelign Belachew. At last year&#8217;s OneRun race, Mokoka edged out Kenyan Daniel Salel to win in 33:34, missing the world best by three seconds and shattering Matthews Motshwarateu&#8217;s 28-year-old SA best by 52 seconds over the rarely run distance, while Gelant produced a brave fight to finish third. &#8220;I want to defend my title&#8230; it is important for me to make sure the title stays in South Africa,&#8221; Mokoka said. The 12km contest, offering a R200 000 prize purse, was scheduled to be held on May 21, and the elite women&#8217;s field was expected to be unveiled closer to the race.
