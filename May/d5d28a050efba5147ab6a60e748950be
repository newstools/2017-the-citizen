She said it was a tough time they had managed to overcome, mainly because she &#8216;analysed&#8217; the situation and looked at what the intentions of the person was who exposed the affair. Norma also said she hadn&#8217;t responded at first because she didn&#8217;t want to fuel the fire, and that while some called her &#8216;ratchet&#8217; for calling Mkhize a &#8216;prostitute&#8217;, she stood by her words and would say it all over again if she had to. Mkhize then released a string of tweets, alleging Malusi had given her R1 million. She threatened to speak out about a private jet that was apparently chartered by the Guptas. &#8220;Stop her from ever bringing this up again or they&#8217;ll hear about December 18. You know me and documenting, I don&#8217;t slip,&#8221; she tweeted to Malusi directly.
