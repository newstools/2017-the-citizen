Minister of Police Fikile Mbalula said all the criminals should know that the &#8220;holiday&#8221; for criminals was over. While addressing Soshanguve residents, who attended the ministeral imbizo in Giant Stadium yesterday, Mbalula said operation &#8220;Wanya tsotsi&#8221; was going to hit criminals like a ton of bricks. Mbalula interacted with different communities in and around Soshanguve and said he found out about the different criminal activities there. &#8220;We are aware and know that there are criminals here who are well known. They get in and out. They are not arrested,&#8221; he said. He added that they were untouchable and were friends with the police. &#8220;We will smoke them out wherever they are. A person gets arrested today, tomorrow you see them walking in the streets,&#8221; he said. He promised the people that the police were going to use all their resources, manpower and everything they had to liberate them from the clutches of criminals. Mbalula continued to say that he was aware that people were unable to report crime because they feared that police were friends with criminals. &#8220;You must work with the police because you&#8217;re crime fighters yourselves,&#8221; he said. He said the police alone would not win a war against crime alone, but with the people they could. He wanted to work with the community in a campaign to get rid of illegal firearms and drugs on the streets. He said crime undermined everything about SA and encouraged people to meet up with their station commanders to address their problems. Deputy Minister of Oolice Bongani Mkongi said they wanted to infuse hope and dedication in the police. Mkongi said the President Jacob Zuma gave them three strategic tasks that were aimed at boosting the morale of police, inspiring hope in the people and declaring war on crime.
