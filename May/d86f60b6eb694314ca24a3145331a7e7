All the four initiates aged between 14 and 21, had complications that led to their deaths and a probe is under way, spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said. A preliminary investigation, discovered that one of the victims was 14 years old, of which according to the Mpumalanga Ingoma Act 3 of 2011, no person under the age of 16 may attend an Ingoma as an initiate (umkhethwa).

The Act states that a minor, may not attend an initiation school without his parents or legal guardians consent.
