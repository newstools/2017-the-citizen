Cassper has been creating hype for his album, Thuto, for months now. The first single of the album, &#8216;Tito Mboweni&#8217;, has had his fans divided, with many loving the jam and others slating it for not being genuine hip-hop. This hasn&#8217;t deterred Cassper though, as he has been in full promotion mode, announcing that Thuto will be dropping on iTunes on today. He also released the full album tracklist, which features international R&amp;B star Goapele, Nadia Nakai, Riky Rick and Tshepo Tshola. The feedback for Cassper&#8217;s album has been positive, with some taking to Twitter to call it his best body of work so far. Cass really opened up on #Thuto. It&#39;s a beautiful album Really impressed with the growth in artistry and musical direction on it. &mdash; #Fuego (@TweezyZA) May 4, 2017 Shout out to my man @CassperNyovest for the release of #Thuto l think this is your best work yet.

Instead, the Supa Mega announced the release of his new single, &#8216;Don&#8217;t Forget To Pray&#8217;, featuring Anatii, who was once a close friend of Cassper. AKA tweeted he &#8216;legit&#8217; didn&#8217;t know his track would coincide with Cassper&#8217;s album, referencing the Mahikeng rapper&#8217;s song, Too Legit Too Quit. He added that he wasn&#8217;t sorry they were promoting music at the same time. Good morning &#8230;. guys, I legit didn&#39;t know niggas was dropping today &#8230;. sorry &#8230;. not sorry. &mdash; AKA (@akaworldwide) May 5, 2017 Reaction to AKA&#8217;s new song below #DontForgetToPray AKA ANATII pic.twitter.com/IqCnk7KTzM &mdash; GrxHxm (GraHam) (@graeme_ayanda) May 4, 2017 AKA X Anatii #DontForgetToPray &mdash; Master Retweeter (@NestoTheJedi) May 5, 2017 Keep the anthems coming @akaworldwide and @ANATII we are ready for the album x #DontForgetToPray #BCWYWF &mdash; #DontforgetToPray (@MissK_Faltein) May 5, 2017 The beats the verses the combination day saved indeed @akaworldwide @ANATII #DontForgetToPray #BCWYWF &mdash; #DontForgetToPray (@kyngkhokhas) May 5, 2017 &nbsp; ALSO READ: Cassper spills on Boity breakup in new song, reveals side chicks, fame led to split For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
