&#8220;I am attached and dedicated to Primedia, which has been my home for 12 years,&#8221; she said. &#8220;In my travels and endeavours, I will keep this amazing place close to my heart. Primedia and 702 in particular have played a crucial role in the evolution of our democracy and consistently given a voice to the voiceless. The commitment to the country and exercise of independent, hard-hitting but fair journalism make me very proud to have been a part of this great institution,&#8221; Redi said. We admire and respect her for her choices and wish her the very best with this new chapter, said 702 station manager, Thabisile Mbete. The good news is that Redi will continue to contribute to Primedia for the foreseeable future, even after she stops doing her regular show. We will continue to work with her as opportunities arise, particularly around social justice issues. We will just create a new relationship. I am not disappearing. My plans are HUGE and we will be together, somehow. Thanks for the validation https://t.co/9HTeIYg1ya &mdash; Redi Tlhabi (@RediTlhabi) May 26, 2017 Yes, I will have a voice. It will be big, global&amp; rooted in social justice. But for now, it is time to learn, retrain, reskill&amp; relaunch &amp; https://t.co/oRDndiFa6K &mdash; Redi Tlhabi (@RediTlhabi) May 26, 2017 Trust me, the social commentary WILL continue, somehow.
