The Hollywood A-lister is the queen of Cannes this year with four different projects at the world&#8217;s top cinema showcase, including &#8220;The Killing of a Sacred Deer&#8221; where she plays a suburban mum who has to choose one of her children to sacrifice. &#8220;I don&#8217;t have to work but I do because it is still my passion, the way in which I express myself,&#8221; the 49-year-old Oscar winner told reporters after the premiere of the creepy thriller. &#8220;At this stage of my life I&#8217;m just trying to stay very bold and open and try things and support filmmakers that I believe in&#8230; I&#8217;m at that place in my life where I still try to act as though I&#8217;m 21 and starting my career.&#8221; Kidman and Irish actor Colin Farrell play a couple of married doctors in &#8220;The Killing of a Sacred Deer&#8221; by Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos, who wowed Cannes two years ago with the dystopian love story &#8220;The Lobster&#8221;. The new picture takes that movie&#8217;s laconic tone and twists into something much darker, after Farrell&#8217;s heart surgeon character operates on a man while he is drunk and kills him. Years later, the dead man&#8217;s teenage son plots revenge, telling the surgeon he must choose a member of his family to kill or they will all suffer an excruciating death. &#8211; &#8216;Up for taking risks&#8217; &#8211; Despite the bone-chilling story inspired by the ancient Greek myth of Iphigenia, the movie also drew big laughs at a packed press screening with pitch-black humour. Kidman admitted the film was disturbing, after a few dozen queasy critics walked out of the screening when the blood began to flow. It drew a mix of boos and applause as the curtain fell but strong reviews from leading critics. &#8220;I have a certain moral compass which I abide by in terms of what I feel I will and won&#8217;t do as a human being. But when I choose a director to work with, obviously that&#8217;s a risk and I&#8217;m totally up for taking risks,&#8221; the actress said. &#8220;When I watched the film I called (Lanthimos) afterwards and said I have not seen anything like it &#8212; I felt hypnotised by it,&#8221; Kidman added, a mother of four, before adding: &#8220;My children will not be seeing this.&#8221; &#8211; &#8216;Ready to jump in&#8217; &#8211; Lanthimos admitted he was &#8220;lucky&#8221; to be able to cast major stars who were &#8220;ready to jump in and make this kind of film&#8221;. Kidman, a photographers&#8217; favourite on the red carpet, is also starring as a punk matriarch at Cannes in the sci-fi romp &#8220;How to Talk to Girls at Parties&#8221;, with a fright-wig look that is in equal parts Siouxsie Sioux and Cruella de Vil and a broad South London accent. Still to come this week is her turn as a pent-up governess of a US Civil War-era girls school in Sofia Coppola&#8217;s highly touted remake of &#8220;The Beguiled&#8221;. And Kidman will attend a special screening of her friend Jane Campion&#8217;s second season of &#8220;Top of the Lake&#8221; in which she is almost unrecognisable as a foil to Elisabeth Moss&#8217;s small-town detective. Like many sought-after actors and directors, Kidman has been drawn by top-drawer television series, including her recent hit &#8220;Big Little Lies&#8221;. But she said she had no plans to abandon the big screen. &#8220;I&#8217;m a huge fan of cinema and being in a dark room watching a film and being transported. I love that and I will always love that,&#8221; Kidman said. The Cannes film festival runs until Sunday. dlc/fg/ach Agence France-Presse For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
