The fraud and theft matter involving Brendon Naidoo the boyfriend of popular South African DJ Ntombezinhle DJ Zinhle Jiyane was on Friday postponed to next month by the Alexandra Magistrates&#8217; Court. Naidoo became public interest after DJ Zinhle posted a picture with the businessman on social media. She referred to him as Bond . Naidoo is facing charges of fraud and theft allegedly committed through his forex trading business in which several people invested their pension monies and never received any returns. At his previous appearance in April, Naidoo was granted bail of R50 000 after he spent 10 days behind bars. On Friday Naidoo, dressed in a grey blazer, white shirt and blue jeans, was accompanied to the court by his mother and grandmother. But the matter was postponed to allow for further investigations. Naidoo will again appear in court on June 9, 2017. Outside the court, Naidoo said he was still in a relationship with DJ Zinhle. We re good, and we ll always be there for each other, and we get stronger by day. He added: The support from everyone has been amazing because they know who I am. The truth will come out. Naidoo did not say why DJ Zinhle was not at his side.
