What appeared to be leaked fluid on only the second lap of the race saw a succession of riders slide off at high speed one after the other into the gravel trap, with some of the racers whacked by flying bikes in the carnage. Championship leader and eventual winner Joan Mir from Spain was among those who went for a medical check-up &#8212; as stewards worked frantically to clean up the track &#8212; but none of the riders was badly hurt and all were able to return for the restart. When the action got back under way 30 minutes later &#8212; the race was shortened to 16 laps &#8212; the Honda rider Mir emerged victorious in what was the fifth race of the season, and easily the most incident-packed. It was the 19-year-old&#8217;s third victory of the season and extended his lead in the championship standings.
