The Lions, on the back of a wonderful trip Down Under where they won all three matches, need to be careful of slipping up before the international season break. Last season, having to travel to Wellington for an away final cost them dearly after they finished second in the standings. This season, they have stayed in the hunt to secure home playoffs by producing consistent and gutsy performances, but still trail the unbeaten Crusaders, who yesterday recorded their 11th victory on the trot with a hard-fought 31-24 victory over the Chiefs in Suva, Fiji. The Lions know they cannot give up more ground to the Crusaders if they harbour hopes of going all the way. This afternoon at Ellis Park, the Lions face the battling Bulls, before hosting the resurgent Kings at home next Sunday two matches that shouldn t give them sleepless nights, yet could come back to haunt them if they don t handle them properly. The Lions should be too good, having won 10 of their 11 matches this season. Between them, the Bulls and Kings have won only seven matches in 20 outings. And three of the Kings four wins have come in their last three matches. But the Bulls have to come right at some stage and the Kings are as dangerous as ever.
