Following their sudden departure, many of us wondered where their next destination will be, well, that curiously has finally been laid to rest; the duo has joined Gagasi FM they ll be hosting the drive time show. After seven years at Metro, the duo felt that they needed a new challenge We knew we were ready for change and something bigger to challenge ourselves. We weren t sure precisely what this change would be, but we believed in having a bigger impact on radio. We put it out to the universe and our paths have aligned with Gagasi FM at the right time. We would like to whole-hearted thank the Gagasi FM team for believing in our vision and entrusting us with their prime time show. We look forward to executing our shared vision for the show with them and growing with the station, shares the duo (SPHEctacula and DJ Naves).
