New Zealand fast bowler Doug Bracewell was Thursday sentenced to 100 hours of community service after pleading guilty to drink-driving after dogs ate his pet parrot. The 26-year-old was more than three times over the New Zealand legal limit when police pulled him over last month. It was his third drink-driving offence in 10 years. The court was told Bracewell decided to drive home from a function after receiving a call from his distressed partner who told him their pet cockatoo had been killed by dogs they were looking after for a friend. His lawyer, Ron Mansfield, said the offending was not about a disregard for road rules but came from a &#8220;genuine concern&#8221; for his partner. &#8220;The cockatoo was of some significance to his partner and she was quite distraught,&#8221; he said. Bracewell had previously issued a statement saying he made a &#8220;massive mistake&#8221; by driving home. &#8220;This was no-one&#8217;s fault but my own&#8230; I&#8217;m deeply embarrassed to have let down so many people be they family, friends, or cricket-lovers.&#8221; During sentencing, Judge Bridget Mackintosh noted Bracewell&#8217;s two previous drink-driving convictions were &#8220;somewhat historic&#8221; but said his alcohol reading was &#8220;relatively high&#8221;, and community work was appropriate. Bracewell, who has taken 72 Test wickets, could have faced up to two years in jail. He has a history of alcohol-fuelled incidents and was suspended for one Test in 2014 after going on a drinking spree with batsman Jesse Ryder, during which he broke a bone in his foot. In 2012, he missed the Test series against England after cutting a foot when he stood on broken glass while cleaning up after a party at his house. Ryder and Bracewell were also suspended for a match in 2012 after an altercation with a bar patron while drinking after a one-dayer against South Africa.
