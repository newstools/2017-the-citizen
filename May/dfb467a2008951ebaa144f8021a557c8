The national dialogue held yesterday, which saw the country s former presidents and a deputy take part, is likely to develop some kind of a report that could be conveyed to the already under-fire President Jacob Zuma, and even to Luthuli House [the ANC], said political analyst Elvis Masoga.

Zuma has set alight major achievements of our democratic dispensation, and that s why South Africa has become united as a society against this presidential arsonist, he said. Masoga said the drafters of the constitution, when they went to work on it in the early 90s, had envisioned somebody like Mandela and leaders who had qualities of humility, wisdom and foresight. They never thought that one day the presidential office could be occupied by a serious delinquent like Zuma&#8221;.

We have heard many people speaking out against President Zuma, but nothing has happened. The only way this dialogue can make a significant difference is if the leaders involved can mobilise the ordinary people on the ground and not keep it among themselves . He warned that the dialogue should not stress that it was about somebody s removal. &nbsp; ALSO READ: There s no crisis in the ANC, says Mbalula For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
