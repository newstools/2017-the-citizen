When given a chance Zackey is rarely off the mark and his runners can often be included in Trifectas and Quartets, no matter what the price. Tara Laing has been giving him rides while Callan Murray is in Hong Kong and he could score in Race 7 on the Fairview Polytrack today, a MR 80 Handicap over 1200m, where he rides Omega Onslaught. The four-year-old son of Jay Peg has had three runs since arriving in Port Elizabeth and started with a win over Zevenastic over 1000m, followed by a 0.60-length third behind Seymour and then a 2.75-length fourth behind Zevenastic in his third start. All three were on the turf but there should be no fears about the move to the Polytrack as he has had four runs on the surface while racing in KwaZulu-Natal. He has not won a race on the Polytrack but has notched up two places. His last was just before the move to the Eastern Cape and he ran a 1.80 length third behind Jason Argo over 1000m. He is a two-time winner, both over 1000m, so there is some concern about the extra 200m although he has placed seven times in nine starts over the distance. Zackey could have ridden Kingoftheworld, a horse for whom he has a lot of respect, but although he loved the Vaal sand and did well in his lone run on the Polytrack, he has yet to place in two runs over 1200m.
