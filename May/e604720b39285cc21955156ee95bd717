When Stephan Lewies talks, he mirrors the Sharks under coach Robert du Preez. This isn&#8217;t a side worried about how good they look on the field. It&#8217;s about getting a job done, achieving results and, vitally, being accountable for poor performances. Also read: Pedigree doesn t mean the Lions stop working hard When the towering Lewies &#8211; a one-cap Springbok lock &#8211; and his teammates were hammered for their depressing 9-all draw with the Rebels, it easily the type of setback that could&#8217;ve derailed their campaign. Instead, the Sharks pulled up their socks and improved immeasurably, culminating in a brilliant win in Buenos Aires the very next week. Lewies and the rest of the forward pack has been at the heart of that. &#8220;There were hard words after that game. I think even the media caught a bit of Robert&#8217;s feelings afterwards,&#8221; he said with a chuckle. &#8220;We were also massively disappointed with that performance. So we went back and did the hard yards.&#8221; Pleasingly though, the Sharks didn&#8217;t just view the Rebels tragicomedy as a wake-up call but also an opportunity to address structural flaws in their game. &#8220;I think we also realised that we don&#8217;t really understand how hard it is to play with a red card so early in the game,&#8221; said Lewies. &#8220;It was a good thing because we had a big discussion about what we&#8217;ll do in such a situation again. It&#8217;s actually quite simple, you just need to cut the needless errors.&#8221; Lewies was actually one of the few men to emerge with credit from the Rebels game, shining on defence and delivering a superb showing in the line-outs. After two years of seemingly endless injury setbacks, the 25-year-old has hit his straps in this campaign and is finally showing the form again that led to higher honours. But the competition and rotation in the lock posision &#8211; where Ruan Botha and Etienne Oosthuizen have also made their mark &#8211; has played a part. &#8220;That competition for a place has brought out the best in us,&#8221; said Lewies. &#8220;We all enjoy and understand each other well. We&#8217;ve been around for a while now, so we know what it takes to be successful at this level. And that means we can&#8217;t have any egos about a rotation policy.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
