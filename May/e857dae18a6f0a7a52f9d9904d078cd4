Norma has been spoiled by her husband, Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba, and took to Instagram to let everyone know just how much. She showed off a gorgeous diamond ring and captioned the image: &#8220;So in love with this new piece, thank you, my hubby.&#8221; Norma deleted the image shortly thereafter, but not before a screenshot was taken. The Gigabas have had a tough time after Norma gave an interview to eNCA in which she spoke out about the extramarital affair that Malusi had with New York-based stylist Buhle Mkhize. Norma said it was a difficult time for her family, as their parents were asking questions about the reports regarding the affair. She questioned Mkhize&#8217;s motives for going to the media and revealing salacious details about the affair, such as romantic holidays and being gifted with R1 million by the finance minister. She also defended her decision to stay in her marriage, saying she would not leave on another person&#8217;s terms. Mkhize retaliated by going an a social media rampage to slam Norma and Malusi, calling them both derogatory names and releasing more details of the affair. The Gigabas have kept their silence about this and posted happy snaps of each other seemingly unbothered by all the fuss. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; READ MORE: eNCA says it didn&#8217;t &#8216;set up&#8217; Norma Gigaba For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
