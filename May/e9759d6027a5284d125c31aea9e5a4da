United Nations Ambassador and musician extraordinaire, Yvonne Chaka Chaka, has partnered with the department of health under the tutelage of MEC Phophi Ramahuba to fight the escalation of malaria infections in Limpopo. Limpopo, together with Mpumalanga, has the highest cases of malaria infection in the country with Giyani that borders Mozambique through the Kruger National Park leading the pack. We can win the fight against malaria if we prioritise cleanliness, said Chaka Chaka during a visit to Hinkesile Secondary School in Xitlakati village outside Dzumeri yesterday. We need to educate our people about healthy environments. We need to make sure our children live in a healthy and clean environment, she said. She pleaded with the royal leaders, members of the community and political leaders to involve youth in educating people about the spread of malaria and the danger it poses. Malaria is caused by a plasmodium parasite and is one of the most dangerous diseases. It is transmitted by a bite from a female mosquito and it can kill when not promptly treated. Delivering a keynote address, Ramathuba, who is also a provincial secretary for the South African Communist Party in Limpopo, said Limpopo has encountered 1 200 cases of malaria in the first week of May. The statistics were reduced recently to less than 300 cases after community members took caution to consult the nearest health facilities, she said. Chief director for clinical support services, Phillip Kruger singled out three hospitals, Donald Fraser, Malamulele and Nkensani as hospitals with the most cases of malaria infection.
