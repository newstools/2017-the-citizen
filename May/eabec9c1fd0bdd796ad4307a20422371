A bad day at the office for the Proteas was soured even further after they were sanctioned for a slow over rate in the first ODI against England in Leeds on Wednesday night. South Africa lost by 72 runs. This is certainly not the first time it has happened under captain AB de Villiers&#8217; watch and he has been banned previously for the same offence. Also read: Wasteful Proteas brought to earth by clinical England The television commentators at one stage mentioned how South Africa&#8217;s over rate had been &#8220;appalling&#8221;, especially after barely 12 overs were completed in the first hour of play. Match referee Andy Pycroft ruled De Villiers and his teammates were one over short within the time limit. That means it was a minor offence and means the players were fined 10% of their match fees, with De Villiers copping a 20% fine. He pleaded guilty. The problem though is that South Africa&#8217;s skipper will now be watched closely and another offence will lead to more serious consequences. With the ICC Champions Trophy starting next week, the Proteas can&#8217;t afford De Villiers to miss any of the matches. Meanwhile, veteran Hashim Amla shouldered some of the blame for the defeat at Headingly. The bearded star was looking comfortable on 73 when he went across his stumps and was trapped LBW. It ended a 112-run second wicket stand with Faf du Plessis (67), who was out soon after. &#8220;We were pretty much on target. Our partnership definitely kept us in the game until about the 25th over,&#8221; said Amla. &#8220;Unfortunately, neither of us were able to get to a hundred. It makes it a lot easier for the rest to chase down a target again. I think 340 was a bit more than we wanted to chase.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
