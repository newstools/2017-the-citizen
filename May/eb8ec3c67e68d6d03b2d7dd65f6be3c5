The Blitzboks were officially crowned World Sevens Series champions for the 2016/17 season in London at the weekend, finishing 5th in the last tournament of the campaign. But they were still head and shoulders above the rest throughout the season. &#8220;We are proudly South Africans today and very proud champions. This one is for the country and for all our fans, especially those who watched us or listened to us play either late at night or early in the morning, when we were playing all over the world. We received massive support, even when things did not go as planned. This was a huge effort and I am a very proud South African and Springbok Sevens player tonight,&#8221; said captain Phillip Snyman. However, the Blitzboks aren&#8217;t only a brilliant team, they also have a massive cool factor. Check out this awesome music video they made with the premise that no-one is present at Cape Town International to greet them! For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
