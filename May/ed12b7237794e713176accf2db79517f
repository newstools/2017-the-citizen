The women&#8217;s race at next week&#8217;s Comrades Marathon has been dealt a massive blow, with defending &#8216;up&#8217; run champion and local favourite Caroline Wostmann pulling out of the annual contest after failing to shake off a persistent hamstring injury. Wostmann, who secured her maiden Comrades victory in 2015 when she missed the &#8216;up&#8217; run record by less than four minutes to end a lengthy winning streak by foreign athletes, had withdrawn during last month&#8217;s Two Oceans 56km race in Cape Town after picking up a niggle during the race. &#8220;Even though everything in me wants to go and run Comrades, I have made the heartbreaking decision to listen to my medical team and withdraw from the race,&#8221; Wostmann said in a statement on Monday. Though she had initially hoped to recover in time for the annual 87km road race in KwaZulu-Natal, Wostmann said the diagnosis was worse than her medical team had initially presumed. &#8220;Despite aggressive treatments and rehab to the injury, it hasn&#8217;t healed sufficiently to allow me to safely compete at Comrades,&#8221; she said. In her absence, the women&#8217;s race was expected to be a wide open battle featuring the likes of compatriot Charne Bosman, who chased down a cramping Wostmann to win last year&#8217;s &#8216;down&#8217; run, and American contender Camille Herron.
