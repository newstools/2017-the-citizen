Siya Kolisi is the first high-profile national player to have publicly given his backing for new Springbok captain Warren Whiteley. The Stormers flanker was touted as a potential candidate for the job given his relative success with the Capetonians but instead seems to be in a battle for the No 6 jersey with Lions star Jaco Kriel. Also read: Warren Whiteley was the logical choice , says Allister Coetzee &#8220;We&#8217;re really happy and proud of Warren,&#8221; said the 25-year-old. &#8220;He&#8217;s a proper leader. It&#8217;s for all to see.&#8221; Yet it&#8217;s not only Whiteley&#8217;s obvious leadership qualities that Kolisi feels appeals to his teammates. It&#8217;s rather the Lions skipper&#8217;s ability to keep players together when things become difficult. Whiteley is credited with be a massive influence on the Lions squad when they were relegated from Super Rugby in 2013 and, given the Boks&#8217; immense struggles in 2016, it&#8217;s expected he&#8217;ll weave his magic at international level as well. &#8220;Warren has stayed loyal to the Lions. He&#8217;s been with them through everything, from the bad times to the good times,&#8221; said Kolisi. &#8220;He&#8217;s always fought through.&#8221; Interestingly, Kolisi also notes one of Whiteley&#8217;s lesser known achievements. &#8220;Warren played a big part in the Blitzboks&#8217; gold medal win at 2014&#8217;s Commonwealth Games,&#8221; he said. &#8220;He&#8217;s a genuine guy on and off the field. I think he&#8217;s going to lead the guys well. The players are happy with the choice and I&#8217;m happy for him.&#8221; For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
