Karabo Mokoena&#8217;s mother, Lolo, has spoken out for the first time after the tragic death of her daughter. In an interview with eNCA&#8217;s CheckPoint, Lolo said that when Karabo&#8217;s boyfriend, Sandile Matsoe, beat her up for the first time, she wanted to confront him about it. She said Karabo came home with a swollen forehead. &#8220;Karabo said to me: &#8216;No, Mama, this guy is crazy.&#8217; &#8220;&#8216;Just leave him, it&#8217;s okay,'&#8221; she said. Even though the 22-year-old woman returned bruised and swollen, Lolo said she would always say, &#8220;It is well, Mom.&#8221; &#8220;I just want to ask him what gave him the right to do this to you,&#8221; she would tell Karabo. In another episode of abuse, Lolo said she was at work when she received a phone call that her daughter had been admitted to Morningside Hospital. She said she cried, and asked Karabo why she was still in a relationship with Mantsoe. When she went to visit her, Karabo told her Mantsoe had dropped her off at the hospital and left her with a card. At the time, he also bought a new phone to replace the one he had broken. This when Lolo again urged her daughter to leave her boyfriend, warning that he would one day kill her. &#8220;I told her and said: &#8216;Karabo, Sandile is going to kill you, you can&#8217;t go on like this. This is not a toxic relationship; I don&#8217;t know what to call this.'&#8221; Lolo said she then urged Karabo to press charges against Mantsoe, which she did, after hesitating, saying Mantsoe was just &#8220;evil&#8221;. A few weeks later, Karabo was reported missing and this was when Lolo finally asked Manstoe what he had done to her daughter. &#8220;I approached him and said: &#8216;Sandile, what did you do to Karabo?&#8217; And he greeted me and said: &#8216;Mamzo,&#8217; and I said: &#8216;Why are you still saying Mamzo? Where&#8217;s my daughter? Did you kill Karabo?&#8217; &#8220;I asked him and he said: &#8216;No, I didn&#8217;t kill Karabo.'&#8221; Mantsoe will appear in court again on Wednesday for his bail application.
