ANC NEC member and Minister of Women in the Presidency Susan Shabangu has been highly criticised over comments she made about Karabo Mokoena. Speaking to eNCA at after Mokoena&#8217;s funeral, she said: &#8220;While Karabo came across as very strong, internally she was weak; hence she became a victim of women abuse and she tried to deal with her situation in sharing with other abused women; she ended up being a victim of abuse.&#8221; Twitter is not impressed with the minister for &#8220;blaming&#8221; the victim for the abuse she suffered at the hands of her boyfriend.

Thanks for nothing, Susan Shabangu!&#8221; &#8220;Susan Shabangu says Karabo was weak and that&#8217;s why she was abused. The person appointed as &#8216;Minister of Women&#8217; Yaaaa neh.&#8221; Some, however, defended her, saying she may have been a victim of the Queen&#8217;s language. They say she had meant to say &#8220;vulnerable&#8221;. On what she thought should be done to curb the rate of women abuse in the country, Shabangu said: &#8220;As government we can have programmes. They&#8217;re not going to be successful if they&#8217;re isolating the society as a whole. Various women&#8217;s organisations, men&#8217;s organisations, men for prayer, they need to pray in a way that is proactive, that is action orientated. And that&#8217;s the only way we can succeed.&#8221; She was criticised for not coming up with a &#8220;proper&#8221; plan to curb women abuse in the country.
