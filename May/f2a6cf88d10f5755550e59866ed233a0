BMW seems to be hard at work preparing its next generation of the high-performance M5 variant. Seen here is the upcoming BMW M5 prototype spotted doing the rounds at the Nurburgring in Germany, and it s wearing the least bit of camouflage gear we ve seen yet. Underneath, the M5 is rumoured to boast an updated V8 engine of the twin-turbocharged 4.4-litre V8 used in the current M5. The current engine produces 412kW and 680Nm of torque, so it is possible for BMW to add a few more kWs for the newest M5. Instead of upping power significantly, the engineers are likely to be more focused on reducing weight. Thanks to the adoption of the modular-designed CLAR platform that debuted in the 2016 7-Series, the new 5-Series is already about 100kg lighter than its predecessor, and similar weight savings should benefit the new M5. Beyond the new platform, another dramatic change for this generation of the M5, the F90 to all the hardcore fans, will be all-wheel drive. For purists, the system is expected to have a feature that allows the driver to switch into a rear-wheel-drive mode, where 100% of the drive torque is sent to the rear wheels only. And the standard transmission is expected to be an 8-speed automatic. Sadly, we ve heard that a manual will no longer be offered. As for the design, we can see a very wide and low front bumper flanked by pumped fenders. We can also see part of the lower intake and the mesh pattern the engineers have selected. At the rear, a small diffuser has been integrated with the bumper unit. Inside the massive wheels are equally massive perforated brake discs. Look for the new M5 to debut late this year or early next. It should arrive as a 2018 model. Direct rivals include the Audi RS 6 and Mercedes-AMG E63.
