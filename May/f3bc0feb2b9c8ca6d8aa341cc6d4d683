Sickly musician and actor Winnie Khumalo has turned to Prophet Paseka &#8216;Mboro&#8217; Motsoeneng for divine intervention. Khumalo, who was recently admitted to hospital after collapsing while recording her hit song Yile Gqom with DJ Cleo, will soon be baptised to become a member of Mboro&#8217;s Incredible Happenings Church. She confirmed to Sunday World that she has approached Mboro, saying she is supposed to go for an operation at the Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital in June. She further told the publication that she believed she was being attacked by evil spirits that want to derail her career. How come she gets sick every time she releases a new song? she asked. Since Mboro started praying for her, she has been feeling &#8220;a bit better&#8221;, and may not even go for the operation as her health has been improving everyday as she keeps paring with the prophet, she told the public. Mboro will also baptise her, as another way of coming closer to God and to grow her spirituality. The prophet told the publication he has put Khumalo in a programme called &#8217;49 Days of Journey with Mboro&#8217; to pray with her. The songbird is not the first celebrity to approach Mboro for prayers, Brickz, Mshoza and Mapaputsi have also been there.
