A small but determined crowd gathered in Pretoria on Saturday at Church Square morning to march to the Union Buildings in a statement against the abuse of women in South Africa, which has reached seemingly epidemic proportions. Under the hashtags #NotInOurName and #StopItNow, they have called on men in South Africa to refrain from abusing and murdering women. The march was organised by several NGOs and civil society groups. The movement had initially kicked off under the hashtag #MenAreTrash in the wake of the high-profile murders of several women and girls, but it has now welcomed the inclusion and support of men, who are being encouraged to say, &#8220;Not in my name,&#8221; when it comes to oppressing women. Reports suggest that many young men turned up for the occasion. Marchers on their way to the Union Buildings to protest against gender-based violence on 20 May 2017.
