Mzansi Magic s new exciting show, Uyangthanda Na, aims to help people to open up to that one person they are crazy about. The show, which started last month, gained a lot of attraction from social media users upon its debut on the channel. Wednesday evening&#8217;s episode got Twitter talking after the determined Dineo Xabawa asked her crush, Sandile, who has been in a relationship for three years, to pick her over his current partner. Dineo knew Sandile was in a relationship, but took the risk and asked him out anyway. Sandile blatantly told Dineo he wasn t interested and that there was another girl in his life. Dineo said: We will see where the relationship takes us, suggesting that she was willing to wait until her crush broke up with his girlfriend, shocking viewers. He ll change his mind, I will wait for him when he s done,&#8221; she said. Twitter got talking about how unashamed Dineo was for pursuing someone who was already in a committed relationship. &nbsp; #Uyangthandana next week gon be pic.twitter.com/KdHgF4x20a &mdash; Coccaine (@zolansibande) May 16, 2017 The aim here&#8230;is to brick #Uyangthandana pic.twitter.com/vk3NuqXhFO &mdash; LushAnn T (@LushAnn_T) May 23, 2017 #Uyangthandana : did she just say &quot;stena ke boza!&quot;?
