Following reports that DJ Zinhle was planning to consult her ancestors and undergo traditional rituals to get rid of &#8220;bad luck&#8221;, DJ Euphonik has come to her defence against the claims. The report had claimed close sources said the DJ wanted to slaughter a goat and a cow in KwaMdakane, KwaZulu-Natal, her birthplace, to appease her ancestors. This is presumably because of her baby daddy, AKA, cheating on her, and, just when thing are looking up, her current boyfriend, Brendon Naidoo, being arrested for allegedly being a scammer. A Twitter user alerted DJ Zinhle to the reports that even the DJ herself denied, saying there were no such rituals that took place and that she had no bad luck. She actually laughed at the reports, saying she could not expect someone who was not living their dream to understand the value of hers. Anyway, I need to get back to work. Can&#39;t keep the crew &amp; ancestors waiting. &mdash; #djzinhlecolours (@DJZinhle) May 3, 2017 &#8220;Anyway, I need to get back to work.
