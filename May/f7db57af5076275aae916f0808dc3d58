The use of government money is a daily topic as the South African public still digests the magnitude of the &#8220;state capture&#8221;. Former Proteas spinner Pat Symcox early on Tuesday tried to shine the spotlight on more &#8220;wasted&#8221; funds by taking pictures of border fencing between South Africa and Zimbabwe. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He took to Twitter to voice his frustration. &#8220;I saw the tragic state of the border between Zim and SA,&#8221; Symcox wrote. &#8220;It is beyond belief. What a waste of money on fences and them not being repaired (sic).&#8221; The 58-year-old, who is nowadays a successful realtor on KwaZulu-Natal&#8217;s South Coast, didn&#8217;t reveal where exactly along the border his pictures were taken. He&#8217;s known for being fairly outspoken and got retweets from Proteas fast bowler Morne Morkel as well as former Springbok captain Bob Skinstad.
