As the insults and comments keep rolling in about Skolopad&#8217;s skimpy outfit which showed off her thigh and bum, the singer and mother of one has responded to all the attention she has been receiving. She took to Twitter to tell journalists who have been wanting to interview her about her dress to rather focus on a song she was set to release today. She also said people felt entitled to her body and tweeted: &#8220;When was the last time you did the things that you want to do and not what the expectations of society dictate.&#8221; Dear Media people wanting a story from me, PLEASE write about a song I&#39;m releasing today. I have nothing to say about my #SAMA23 dress &mdash; #TLOBONENG SKOLOPAD (@skolopad) May 29, 2017 Going through your comments and insults about my weekend at the #SAMA23. People feel so entitled to MY body hle. Tj &mdash; #TLOBONENG (@skolopad) May 29, 2017 When was the last time you did the things that YOU want to do and not what the expectations of the society dictate? &mdash; #TLOBONENG SKOLOPAD (@skolopad) May 28, 2017 People who are giving me attention, accuse me of liking attention like they are not gonna talk about me for the whole week, MINIMUM &mdash; #TLOBONENG (@skolopad) May 28, 2017 In an interview with People magazine, Skolopad said her daughter helped her choose her outfits. &#8220;She s been managing me since the Skolopad brand started in 2014. She chooses my outfits, shoes, hair and even writes most of my songs. I love house music and am all about the beat and the mixes. All the pictures of me posing naked or showing off my bum and tattoo she takes them. Even when we are at a gig and some photographers ask to take pictures of me, she directs them on how to do it. She will even shout at them if they aren t doing it the way she wants. She ll say: I told you, don t take that angle of my mother! About her outfit choices and all the negative comments that she encountered the rape survivor said they were the least of her worries. &#8220;I m not affected by people saying negative things at all, I just wanted people to talk. I have overcome cervical cancer, and I am a rape survivor. Negative comments are the least of my worries.&#8221; READ MORE: Some of the best behind the scenes moments from the Samas For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
