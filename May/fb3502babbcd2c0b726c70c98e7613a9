Some of you will notice that almost all VW Golf models have been evolutionary rather than revolutionary and that will likely be the case with the much-anticipated Golf 8. . So far, the Golf sits on top of the list as the Wolfsburg s best-selling model. It makes sense and gives reasons why all the seven Golf models have been absolute hits for the company. Looking at the Golf 8, it will likely land on our shores sometime in 2019 with the GTI likely to arrive in 2020. As expected with every new generation model, the Golf 8 will go through extensive changes, although it will ride on the same MQB architecture that underpins the current Golf and Audi s third-generation A3. It will likely lose some estimated 50kg weight, and is going to make the switch to a 48V electrical system and an integrated starter motor. Reports by Cars.co.za state that the German manufacturer has already 3 derivatives on the cards a standard GTI, a Performance Pack and Clubsport. Golf Clubsport The target power output for the base GTI is said to be the recent Clubsport s 195 kW. It is rumoured that an overboost function provided by an electric motor mounted in the front section of the transmission is a possibility, effectively turning the next Golf GTI into a mild hybrid. The Golf 8 GTI Clubsport could pack as much as 240kW from its 2.0-litre turbopetrol. The eighth Golf GTI is expected to feature a mild hybrid system by adopting an electrically operated compressor to boost low-end torque. Rumour has it there is going to be a Performance mode, which, upon activation, will turn on an electric motor mounted in front of the seven-speed, dual-clutch gearbox. . This will effectively give the Golf GTI a boost function, with the 2.0-litre combustion engine and the electric motor working together to deliver more performance while retaining the front-wheel-drive layout. Lookout for it at some point in 2019, so the hotter GTI is likely slated to arrive in 2020. Follow us on Instagram and Twitter
