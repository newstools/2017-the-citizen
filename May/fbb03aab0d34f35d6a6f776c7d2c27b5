Minister of Finance Malusi Gigaba&#8217;s wife, Norma Gigaba, has left Twitter in anger after saying she deals with tenders. In a short clip that has been circulating on social media, the minister&#8217;s wife says: &#8220;&#8230;so I deal with a lot of tenders, we put tenders together&#8230;&#8221; Though the clip is only a few seconds long, Twitter does not care about what she said before or after the segment, what they want to know is how she gets these tenders she speaks of. These were some of the reactions on Twitter: &#8220;How did we get here..heartbreaking !

Speaking to City Press at the time, Norma said she was spending her own money. &#8220;I have no tender, as some people believe and neither do I spend Malusi&#8217;s money,&#8221; she was quoted as saying. She further denied buying the sneakers, saying the owner of the sneakers asked her to pose in them so they could take a picture.
