Pastor Paul Sanyangore of Victory World International has claimed to have a direct phone number to heaven, after a video of him talking on the phone during a church service emerged. In the video, the pastor can be seen holding his cellphone and responding to God&#8217;s questions, he claims. He calls a woman from the crowd, and as she kneels down, he then starts receiving instructions from &#8220;heaven&#8221;. &#8220;Hello, is this heaven? I have a woman here, what do you have to say about her? Oh &#8230; I should ask her who is Sibo,&#8221; he asks &#8220;heaven&#8221;. The woman then responds telling him who the said person is. &#8220;What else Papa God? What else? God is telling me to ask you why is it He&#8217;s showing me a heart?&#8221; The woman again responds. &#8220;He says we should pray for your children, two of them. He is saying the other one is epileptic, the other one is asthmatic. He is saying I should ask you who is in Bulawayo.&#8221; The woman then tells the pastor that the said children are in Bulawayo. &#8220;God is telling me to tell you your story has changed. God is telling me to ask you about a food outlet.&#8221; Again the woman responds. &#8220;Heaven in online,&#8221; he says. Watch the video below: In an interview with Zimbabwean news site H-Metro, the pastor, also known as Pastor Talent, said he did not understand why people were surprised about his actions, further claiming to have a direct number to God. I have a direct channel, actually I have His number and I can call Him when need arises. It is possible to talk to God; why would you doubt that I got a call from Him? I actually have a direct line which I can call Him on and get instructions on how to proceed. I got this when I was praying and I heard a voice telling me to call direct, he was quoted as saying. He reportedly said he would make the numbers available to the public when the time was right.
