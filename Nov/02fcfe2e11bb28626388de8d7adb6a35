				                 The unrest escalated quickly and reached the Lulekani taxi rank, in Phalaborwa, where schoolchildren, workers and other commuters were denied access to transportation, Letaba Herald reports.
The situation is still very tense. Protesters are burning tyres on the road and blocking all cars passing by.
Residents are advised to use alternative routes and to exercise caution.
Reasons for the strike are still unclear.
