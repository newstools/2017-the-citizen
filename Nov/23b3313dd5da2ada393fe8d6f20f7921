He claimed that he himself had been “assaulted and kidnapped for more than three hours” during the incident in Kenge, east of the capital.
However, according to a statement by the national police, only one protester was wounded in the head, and that was caused by stones thrown by other demonstrators.
The police “fired in the air to disperse a crowd that had not been approved by Kenge City Hall”, said Emery Kaputa Vita, deputy governor of Kwango Province, where Kenge, some 270 kilometres (170 miles) from Kinshasa, said.
The opposition coalition and other citizens’ movements are against the vote schedule published by the electoral commission in the DR Congo.

Kabila was scheduled to have stepped down in December 2016 after a constitutional maximum of two terms in office.
Those against President Kabila’s stay in power are mobilising force his departure by 31 December, 2017 at the latest.

The opposition are considering a “peaceful demonstration” in Kinshasa on November 28, according to a letter seen by AFP.
