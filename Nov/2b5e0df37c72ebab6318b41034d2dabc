				                 The ANC in KwaZulu-Natal on Tuesday, said that confirmed figures for eligible branch general meetings (BGM) that have convened prior to next month’s national conference are vastly different to those tallied at head office.
African National Congress (ANC) secretary general Gwede Mantashe announced during a media briefing at Luthuli House that only 40.9 percent of KZN branches had successfully completed their BGMs.
Mantashe was briefing journalists at the conclusion of a three-day special national executive committee meeting held in Irene, south of Pretoria.
KZN’s 806 eligible ANC branches are convening to nominate delegates and leadership for the party’s 54th national conference in December. Nominations have to be completed by November 15, but Mantashe said they would still be accepting results after the weekend.
“He clearly doesn’t have the correct and latest figures. KZN has done almost 700 of the 828 branches. That cannot be 40 percent,” KZN ANC spokesperson Mdumsieni Ntuli told ANA via text message during Mantashe’s briefing.
Ntuli also confirmed that only 806 branches were in good standing.
On his Facebook page later, Ntuli posted a list showing that out of the 806 branches, 633 had held successful general meetings with only 173 outstanding. According to the ANC in KZN then, 78.5 percent of branches had successfully convened.
Said Ntuli along with the list, “These are the real numbers and breakdowns per region in KZN. You can work out its meaning and percent. We shall meet at the 54th National Conference on the 15 December 2017.”
When asked about the discrepancy, Mantashe said, “I report about what we have received here,” and then told ANA to “contact Super”.
Super Zuma is the secretary of ANC in KwaZulu-Natal, he could not immediately be reached for comment.
