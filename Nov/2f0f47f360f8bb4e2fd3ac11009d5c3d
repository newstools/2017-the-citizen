				                 Today, there are going to be hundreds of thousands of people around South Africa diving head-first into the frenzy of “Black Friday”.
There are going to be bargains to be had out there – ranging from the not bad to the eye-popping – and there are no doubt those who so love buying things that they will shop ’till they drop. But, shopping can also provide a useful bit of escapism from our current reality which is, even by the most soft assessment, “tough”.
Fuel prices are about to rise, dragging food and other prices along with them; GDP growth needs a microscope to calculate; the world’s financial fundis are about to downgrade us and we sometimes feel they are right: we are junk.
Today, though, provides that heady rush of adrenaline – something our ancestors might have experienced hunting for sabre-toothed tigers – which will make us feel vibrantly alive. Tomorrow will be the hangover – from battered joints, battered wallets and battered credit cards – and reality will return with a thud.
But for now, go out there and enjoy. Have fun. Get the killer bargains. You’re tough. Get going.
