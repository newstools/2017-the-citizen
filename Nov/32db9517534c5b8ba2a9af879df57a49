				                 Addressing the national consultative conference of the stalwarts and veterans of the ANC on Sunday at Constitution Hill in Johannesburg, Mbeki said politicians who abuse state power for their own self-enrichment had negatively impacted on the governing party at local‚ provincial and national level.
“It is clear that the ANC has been captured by a dominant faction which, in fact, is not ANC,” Mbeki said. “But really what we are dealing with is a rot that has infested the organisation as a whole.”
The former statesman also said the rot within the ANC had led to money that should have gone to some municipalities being stolen.
