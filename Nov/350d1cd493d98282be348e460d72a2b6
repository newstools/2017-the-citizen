				                 London – It is difficult to escape the charms of Master Singer in the big race at Newcastle today.
John Gosden’s colt ripped up few trees on the turf this year, but all-weather racing is clearly more of his bag from what he has so far achieved in a seven-race career.
Master Singer broke his maiden over 2000m at this track in May, when he won by a ridiculous 16 lengths.  His other success, over 2400m at Wolverhampton last month, was nowhere near as visually striking – yet it was probably just as good in the grand scheme of things.
The three-year-old son of Giant’s Causeway showed plenty of willingness to succeed when he defeated Goldmember by a length in what was a very competitive handicap.  This Betway-sponsored handicap over the same trip is probably a little tougher, but a 2.5kg rise in the weights is hardly a catastrophe for a horse who should make hay this winter.
Take Wins with TAB. Wincanton has staged better meetings, but it could pay to side with Springtown Lake in a 4000m handicap hurdle. This former point-to-pointer has not done a great deal wrong since going hurdling. He can be a little keen, but has a powerful engine.
