				                 The Coega Development Corporation (CDC) in the Eastern Cape has been nominated as a finalist for top performing public service award category at the 15th annual South African national business awards.
“As a previous winner of the award, we certainly are optimistic that our performance in the last financial year will speak for itself on the night,” said Ayanda Vilakazi, CDC head of marketing and communications.
The CDC’s nomination follows the organisation recently having been crowned winners at three different award ceremonies since the start of the year. The awards include the Vision 2030 – Infrastructure Development award, Sub-Suharan Enterprise Awards – Best International Trade Marketing Specialist in Africa, and Top Employer 2018 – Certified Excellence in Employer Conditions.
The National Business awards have been in existence for more than a decade and awards outstanding results by companies in specific focus areas such as sustainability, customer focus, tech innovation, fast-growth and more.
