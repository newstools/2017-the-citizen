				                 President Jacob Zuma has ordered that the National Flag be flown at half-mast at every flag station in the Free State on Saturday, after he declared a Special Provincial Official Funeral for the liberation struggle veteran, Dr Mochubela Seekoe.
Seekoe’s funeral would be held on Saturday.
“Dr Seekoe will be remembered for the significant contribution he made during the liberation struggle and in the development of a democratic South Africa. He has served the country with distinction as a South African Ambassador to Russia and a Chairperson of the South African Nuclear Energy Corporation board,” Zuma said in a statement on Friday.
“We wish to extend our heartfelt condolences to Seekoe family, relatives and his political home, the African National Congress. May his soul rest in peace.”
Seekoe is a former head of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) recommendation structure and the first deputy secretary general of the ANC Veterans League. He was also one of the first struggle activists that joined Umkhonto Wesizwe in exile in 1961 and formed part of the Luthuli Detachment, the Presidency said.
