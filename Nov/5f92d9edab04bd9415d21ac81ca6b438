				                 A group of about 200 supporters of Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa held a rally in KwaMhlanga in Mpumalanga on Saturday about 200 metres away from the stadium where another rally, held by the ANC Women’s League (ANCWL), was being addressed by Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma.
Dlamini-Zuma and Ramaphosa are frontrunners in the race to succeed President Jacob Zuma as African National Congress president at the ANC’s elective conference scheduled for next month.
Some of the people at the Ramaphosa supporters’ rally told the African News Agency (ANA) that they decided to stage their own gathering there because they disapproved of the ANCWL rally, but did not reveal reasons for their disapproval.
“That thing [ANCWL rally] is not part of our organisation. The ANC is here in our rally. We don’t even know what is happening there,” said Ramaphosa supporter David Ntuli.

Another Ramaphosa backer, Sydney Mashaba, said another reason for holding their own gathering was that they could not travel to Mbombela, about 375km away, where Ramaphosa also addressed a rally on Saturday.
ANC Nkangala regional spokesman Sello Matshoga said he was aware of ANC members who staged a rally outside the stadium, but said he would comment “later”.
Dlamini-Zuma was greeted with loud cheers by a crowd of about 5000 people, which included members of the ANCWL and ANC Youth League. She was accompanied by, among others, ANC deputy secretary general Jessie Duarte and ANCWL president Bathabile Dlamini.
Dlamini-Zuma appealed for peace among ANC members during the build-up to and at the upcoming conference.
