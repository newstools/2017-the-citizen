I am happy we finally release a track that represents us both in equal measure. We can only go higher!” For the better part of 2017, Sauti Sol was silently and tirelessly working on the Afrikan Sauce LP across Africa. “We couldn’t be happier to share this news with our fans. Our aim with this LP is to connect Africa through music” revealing, “The LP’s body of work will be a continuation of our LIVE AND DIE IN AFRIKA theme.”
