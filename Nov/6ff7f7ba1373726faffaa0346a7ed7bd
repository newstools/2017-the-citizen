				                 Magical Wonderland lost her unbeaten record when giving Snowdance way too much start last time, but returns to spearhead the Candice Bass-Robinson challenge in Saturday’s WSB Fillies Guineas at Kenilworth.
“She is doing very well and is ready to go from a good draw. We have Snowdance to beat, but expect a big run from our filly,’’ was the quietly optimistic summation from the trainer. Anton Marcus rides Robinson’s other entry, Querari filly Rings And Things. The one time winner has the lowest merit rating in the field  and the trainer is realistic about her chances.
“She meets this type of class for the first time, but is consistent  and if she gets the run of the race she can possibly earn a stake.’’ In the WSB Merchants Robinson has a trio  including Marinaresco, who starts his Cape campaign. “We are going a new route with him this season – the Merchants, the Queen’s Plate and the  Met. He is very fresh and well  and will be running on, although obviously this is too sharp and 62kg is a big weight for a little horse,’’ she said about the Vodacom Durban July hero.
By contrast, she sees star threeyear-old Dutch Philip as having “a genuine winning chance, even though he is 2kg under sufferance. The plan after that is to run in the Guineas on 16 December. He may well turn out to be best sprinting, but we will take our chances there as you only get one opportunity.”
