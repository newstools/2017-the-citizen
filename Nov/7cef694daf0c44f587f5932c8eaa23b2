ER24 and local emergency medical services (EMS) paramedics arrived on the scene at about 6pm where they found a car split in half, ER24 spokesman Werner Vermaak said.
“Two occupants from the light motor vehicle were found on the scene with fatal injuries. There was nothing that paramedics could do for them and they were declared dead on [the] scene,” he said.
A woman from the car and the occupants from the bakkie were treated on the scene and transported to a nearby hospital for further care. The cause of the crash was not yet known, Vermaak said.
