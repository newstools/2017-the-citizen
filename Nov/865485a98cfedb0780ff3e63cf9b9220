				                 A 41-year-old Western Cape traffic officer briefly appeared in the Bellville Specialised Crimes Court on Friday, facing charges of fraud, corruption and defeating ends of justice, the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (better known as the Hawks) said.
Spokesperson Captain Lloyd Ramovha said Reginald Heinrich Carolus was arrested on Thursday, following allegations that implicated him in two corrupt activities at the Laaiplek Traffic Department earlier this year.
Carolus allegedly assisted a learner’s license applicant to obtain a license, despite the applicant not being subjected to the basic test, Ramovha said.
“Additionally, to that  he unduly assisted a motorist to acquire a road worthy certificate for a vehicle that never went through a mandatory test, despite him not being a designated official dealing with testing of vehicles.”
Ramovha said Carolus was released on R3000 bail, and the matter was postponed to January 30, for finalisation of investigations.
