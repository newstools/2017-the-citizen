				                 An experimental 31-year-old gentleman – whose name is not known – dashed to the emergency room in Fuzhou, China, because he was left doubled over in pain after he’d stuffed the metal object up inside his urethra as part of an odd sexual desire.
But, rather than tell doctors what he’d done, the man remained tight-lipped and it wasn’t until he was given an X-ray that medics found the lock stuck in his bladder.
According to Pear Video, the man – who was accompanied by his family – later told doctors that he had a habit of “playing with his sexual organs”
He’s set to undergo an operation over the next few days.
It’s not yet known whether the metal sex play will have any last damage.
