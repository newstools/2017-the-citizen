				                 MultiChoice – the pay-TV company that owns DStv and M-Net – reportedly made a questionable payment of R25 million to the Guptas’ controversial news channel ANN7, according to the latest #GuptaLeaks.
News24 reported on Friday that MultiChoice in addition increased its annual payment to ANN7 from R50 million to R141 million.
The payments are said to have happened after the controversial family apparently assisted former communications minister Faith Muthambi in getting President Jacob Zuma to transfer certain broadcasting powers to her, which MultiChoice reportedly was lobbying the minister for.
According to the report, after the transfer of the powers, Muthambi controversially supported a decision in favour of unencrypted set-top boxes, which benefitted MultiChoice.
This was despite the minister’s decision being against the ANC’s policy on the issue. The governing party supported encryption in order to promote competition in the sector.
The Constitutional Court earlier this year ruled that it was within Muthambi’s right to make policy decisions affecting the broadcasting sector following a lengthy court battle.
In response to the allegations, MultiChoice denied that there was any relationship between the policy outcome in its favour and payments made to ANN7.
“MultiChoice rejects your insinuations in the strongest possible terms,” the pay-TV operator said in a statement.
