				                 A father and son appeared in the Bloemfontein Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday, for the attempted murder of two Free State police officers.
Colonel Thandi Mbambo said Kwini Isaac Budutu, 57, and Tshotleho Alfred Makhele, 27, were remanded in custody and their case postponed to November 28, for formal bail application.
The two allegedly attacked Sergeant Mokone Moroane and Constable Pitso Bulane on Sunday, while the police officers were attending a case at Pampita farm where the complainant asked police to intervene in the altercation between her and another lady.
“While [the officers were] talking to the complainant, Kwini appeared from nowhere and started insulting both police officers on the scene.
“They then tried to talk to him, but his son, Tshotleho hit Sergeant Moroane with the fist, and suddenly it became a big fight that included the community of Pampita… Then Kwini stabbed Sgt Moroane on the right hand side of the back with a knife and Constable Bulane at the back.”
The police officer called for back-up and two men were arrested on the scene.
“Both police officers were then rushed to Rosepark hospital for medical attention.”
