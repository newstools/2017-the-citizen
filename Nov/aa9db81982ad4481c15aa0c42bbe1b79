				                 A former travel agent, who was out on bail after being arrested in connection with an airline ticket scam, is back behind bars after she allegedly continued swindling people, the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (DPCI) said on Monday.
 
The DPCI, the police’s specialised unit more commonly known as the Hawks, said in a statement that Kim Robbertse was rearrested last week.
 
Hawks spokesperson Captain Lloyd Ramovha said the travel agent had duped people into paying for “cheaper” flights that never materialised.
 
“Robbertse reportedly pocketed in access (sic) of R7million from her unlawful activities. She was initially arrested during 2016 in Durbanville, Cape Town, following a wave of complaints countrywide,” said Ramovha.
 
“She would allegedly advertise somewhat cheaper airline tickets online and take deposits. Some of the victims were reportedly left stranded at airports on the day of their supposed scheduled journeys.”
 
While appearing on one of her pending cases in the Bellville Specialised Commercial Crime Court, police arrested her after they received information she had allegedly continued defrauding more people “using the same modus operandi while out on bail”.

Robbertse will remain in custody until she appears in court on Tuesday.
 
Ramovha said people who fell victim to Robbertse should get into contact with investigating officer Gerhard Erasmus on erasmusgerhard@saps.gov.za or 021 918 3000.
