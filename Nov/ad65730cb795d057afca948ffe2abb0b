				                 Police Minister Fikile Mbalula has vowed that the work of the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) will not be impeded by the police.
Mbalula made the commitment in Tshwane yesterday at the official inauguration of the new commissioner of police, General Khehla John Sitole. Mbalula told Sitole it was crucial that the police worked closely and harmoniously with other components of the justice system.
He emphasised that the independence of Ipid was a key area of concern for him. Before hundreds of policemen and women at the official parade, where Sitole was presented with the sword of command, Mbalula said: “General, we also encourage you to provide stability in the organisation and finalise the transformation and complete amalgamation of all 14 pre-democracy different police forces into a democratic Saps in an equitable and fair manner.”
He noted that 11 of the 14 forces were from the former TBVC homelands, while the other three units incorporated into the Saps were the intelligence and protection units of MK and Apla, which comprised the “nonstatutory” block in the service.
Sitole promised to serve the country with loyalty, courage dignity and honour.
President Jacob Zuma did not attend the ceremony.
