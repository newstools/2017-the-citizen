I asked a few people around (of course salaried friends like myself) over the weekend if they would be willing to pay a sum of Sh13,500 for a beef wrap. My survey guinea pigs answered ‘no’. Then I thought of rephrasing my question: Would you pay a sum of Sh13,500 for a beef wrap at Café Aroma – for those who’ve been there, responded with thumbs up and that it is definitely ‘worth it’. Taking the word from the foodies, we thought of giving it a try at Upanga’s popular coffeehouse, ‘Café Aroma’.The cafe, located in the puma energy petrol station along the ocean road looks super cosy and striking for any passer-by. With enough parking spaces available, there is an option to sit inside and high tables are set outside (a pointer for smokers). What’s new: I found an interesting section in their food menu, ‘bagels’, not a popular pick at the cafes here but quite a common choice in the West. A bagel looks more or less like a doughnut but traditionally rolled by a hand. The sub section stretches from the classic cream cheese to a chicken avocado bagel. The other options to choose from were waffles, hot and cold drinks, salads, wraps etc. The wrap: Cheesy beef wrap was our obvious pick. It literally took minutes for the order to arrive. It came on a platter with chips I could count and fresh salad, neatly presented and stuffed to perfection (cheese, steak, lettuce, tomato, green pepper, in-house sauce). Gets all the points for taste and enough for just one person. My verdict: Though I would not pay Sh13,500 for the wrap again, I would definitely suggest it to anyone. The price for the food is steep but nevertheless, I guess a good conversation with your loved one over a beef wrap is priceless!Email: thassanali@tz.nationmedia.com
