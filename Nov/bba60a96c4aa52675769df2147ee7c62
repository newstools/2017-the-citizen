				                 Democratic Alliance Gauteng leader John Moodey has been re-elected to his position at the DA’s provincial congress at the Gallagher Convention Centre in Midrand, Johannesburg, the party said on Saturday.
The DA elected the team that would lead it to the 2019 general election, DA spokeswoman Anneke Scheepers said.
“DA-led administrations are already delivering on the commitment of real change to the 4.4 million people in the City of Joburg and the 2.9 million people in the City of Tshwane. In 2019 we will bring about real change to all the people of Gauteng,” she said.
The DA’s Gauteng leadership elections were conducted by secret ballot and voting was done using the Hunt-Le Roux single transferable vote system. The 1300 delegates from across the province elected a leadership collective which would lead the party’s campaign to “occupy the office of the premier and the Union Buildings”, Scheepers said.
Apart from Moodey’s re-election, Mike Moriarty was elected DA provincial chairman with Bongani Nkomo as his deputy. Suzanne Clarke was elected Democratic Alliance Women’s Network (Dawn) provincial chairperson, and Pogiso Mthimunye was elected DA Youth provincial chairperson.
