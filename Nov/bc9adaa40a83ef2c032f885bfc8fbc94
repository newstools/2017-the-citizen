				                 Here are a few must-haves to make sure that your workout goes as smoothly as possible:
1. The right clothes
Choose lightweight, quick-drying and well-fitted clothing. Trade your cotton clothing for synthetics that are designed to draw moisture away from the skin to ensure optimal evaporation.
 2. Reliable shoes
It is important to find the right shoes for your type of training – whether a boxer, runner, cyclist or lifter. Sufficient support can contribute to stability and alleviate pressure on your back and knees.
 3. Music and earphones
Training to music is a personal preference. Some people enjoy the silence, while others find that music motivates them. Train to the music you like, and create a personalised playlist suited to your routine. Your headphones and earphones should fit comfortably and be light.
4. A pre-workout snack
Eat a light meal at least two hours before your workout. If you’re short on time, a snack just before your session will do.
5. Something to drink
Water is non-negotiable because you have to be hydrated. If you don’t usually drink it, an infuser water bottle will encourage you as you can add your favourite flavour.
6. Towel
Get a compact, durable towel that provides maximum sweat absorption. Ideally, get one with a small pocket and zip; it is useful to keep your phone or important belongings inside and with you at all times.
