“These were Malian goldminers, assisted by Malian gendarmes, who attacked the Guinean goldminers at a mine in the village of Faranokho,” leaving two Guineans wounded, a Guinean security source said.
A revenge attack by Guinean villagers killed six people, the source added, specifying those dead were “two Guineans and four Malians, one of them a gendarme”.
In Mali, the security and civil protection ministry confirmed that a “group of armed Guinean nationals” had conducted a series of attacks, leaving two dead in the early hours of Monday on the Malian side of the border.
Two more gendarmes were killed late Monday morning in an ambush by the armed men, the ministry said in a statement read out on Malian television.
Bamako and Conakry have both since beefed up security in the area, which is no stranger to this type of dispute.
Guinea’s territorial administration ministry said it could not comment until it had a fuller picture of events.
