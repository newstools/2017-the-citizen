				                 EFF deputy president Floyd Shivambu has left the party’s followers with a sigh of relief after making it clear they would not support the ANC’s motion of no confidence in Joburg mayor Herman Mashaba at the City of Johannesburg council chambers on Thursday.
The ANC has accused Mashaba of running the City into financial ruin and failing to deliver basic services,and now, they want him out, but the DA says it will fail.
“Despite inheriting enormous challenges left behind by the previous ANC administration, mayor Herman Mashaba’s government is working hard to turn the inner city into the heartbeat of Johannesburg, a place of opportunity for all residents,” said the DA.


Shivambu said the EFF would not support “any of the opportunist” motions of no confidence brought by the ANC in metros.
“Any rational and sensible South Africa will know that of all devils, the ANC in its present form is not an option and can’t be trusted with political power. They must go jump!” he said.
Though Malema did not say anything about supporting the motion, he said the way the DA was handling the matter was no different from the ANC.
“The DA is making a Joburg mayor issue a party issue instead of residences’ issue. If Mayor @HermanMashaba is doing good for the community, why not call upon every citizen to join the march in his support?” he said.
