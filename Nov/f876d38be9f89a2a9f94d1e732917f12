				                 A motorcyclist was killed and another was injured in two separate accidents on the N2 near the M7 off-ramp in Durban on Sunday, paramedics said.
Rescue Care paramedics assisted with the annual motorbike charity Toy Run – from the Pavilion to Amanzimtoti – on Sunday, Rescue Care spokesman Garrith Jamieson said.
While on the route, paramedics were called to a bike accident on the N2 southbound just after the M7 off-ramp just after 10am, he said.
“On arrival, paramedics found the man lying in the centre [median]. He had suffered major injuries and advanced life support paramedics attempted to resuscitate the man on [the] scene. However, he had suffered major injuries and after approximately 30 minutes the man was declared deceased.”
In a second motorbike accident, this time on the N2 northbound before the M7 off-ramp, paramedics found a bike and a car had collided around 1.30pm. The biker had sustained minor injuries and was stabilised on the scene before being transported to a nearby hospital for the further care that he required. At this stage, the cause of the two accidents was unknown, Jamieson said.
