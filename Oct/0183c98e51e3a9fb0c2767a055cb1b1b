Champion trainer Sean Tarry has nominated 2015 winner Stonehenge while Brett Crawford has entered Nebula, who won this Grade 3 race over 2000m last year. As expected there are a number of raiders among the 30 entries with Western Cape trainers being most dominant.
Candice Bass-Robinson has nominated Ben-Hur and Ollivander, other than Nebula Crawford has submitted the names of Our Emperor and The Great One, Glen Kotzen has picked Our Fort to run in the event, Andre Nel has nominated Load shedder and Tarry has added Stonehenge into the mix.
Justin Snaith also has a fistful of entries but he does have a yard in Port Elizabeth and many of his entries have been based there for quite a while.
Master’s Eye is one of Snaith’s six entries and he last raced at Fairview in 2015 when a 2.25-length second behind St Tropez in the East Cape Derby. Masterly and True Master are regulars in Port Elizabeth but Snaith has included three exciting prospects who will be having their first runs at Fairview. They are Platinum Prince, Strathdon and Star Chestnut.
Platinum Prince has been in excellent form and has reeled off four wins in a row. The four-year-old son of Silvano has won his only start over 2000m and runs o a merit rating of 94. Strathdon, also by Silvano, is a four-time winner from 11 starts and has won both of his 2000m runs. He is currently rated 85.
Star Chestnut is also a four-time winner but this five-year-old has yet to prove he sees out 2000m. He runs o a rating of 93.



Local trainers have also supported the race and among the entries is Grant Paddock-trained Alghadeer who ran third behind Nebula last year.
Supplementary entries close at 9am on Thursday a er which the weights will be published.
Declarations close at 10am on Monday 23 October.
