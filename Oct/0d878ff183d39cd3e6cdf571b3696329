ER24 paramedics, along with other services, arrived on the scene to find a taxi on one side of the road while a car was found on the opposite side of the road, ER24 spokesman Russel Meiring said.
“Numerous members of the public had already gathered on the scene, now crowding around the vehicles. Upon closer inspection, paramedics discovered the lifeless body of a man lying trapped in the driver’s seat of the light motor vehicle. Unfortunately, the man had already succumbed to his injuries. Nothing more could be done for him and he was declared dead.”
Three other men were found to have been travelling in the car. One was critically injured while the two others sustained moderate injuries. Ten other people, all from the taxi, were assessed and found to have sustained minor to moderate injuries.
Paramedics treated the patients and provided the critically injured man with advanced life support interventions. Once treated, the patients were transported to various hospitals for further treatment. The cause of the crash was not yet known, Meiring said.
