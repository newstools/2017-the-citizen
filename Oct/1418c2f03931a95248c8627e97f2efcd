				                 It was a cynical old British journo, looking at the coups and wars of post-independence Africa, who coined the line: “One man, one vote … once.”
For decades, democracy struggled to gain a toehold on this continent as presidents-for-life and thuggish generals oppressed their people and looted their countries’ vaults.
From the 1990s and into the 21st century, however, the winds of optimistic change were blowing, with South Africa the poster child for freedom.
Elections began to be held and the voices of ordinary Africans began to be heard, often for the first time, in parliaments across the continent. That is why what is happening in Kenya is deeply disturbing.
Yesterday, the polling booths in some areas were nearly empty as opposition leader Raila Odinga called on his followers to boycott a rerun of August’s disputed presidential election, which was won by president Uhuru Kenyatta.
In other places, there was violence, as security forces cracked down on Odinga’s demonstrating supporters.
If an apparently well-off and stable country like Kenya can be wracked by such instability, what hope is there for poorer countries, or those run by dictatorships?
Africa’s progress will continue to be hobbled until its leaders genuinely accept that the will of the people is paramount.
