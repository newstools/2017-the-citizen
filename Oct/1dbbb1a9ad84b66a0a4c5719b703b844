				                 Four suspects aged between 26 and 34 appeared on Friday in the Ladysmith Magistrates’ Court on charges of possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition, Ladysmith Gazette reports.
On Thursday night (October 12), as part of an intelligence-driven operation, members of the Ladysmith K9 Unit and Ladysmith Visible Policing received information that a business robbery was going to take place in the Hyde Park area of Ladysmith.
The police officers closed off the area and discovered a vehicle in the vicinity with four occupants. The four were arrested after they were found to be in possession of two unlicensed firearms and eight rounds of ammunition.

Two cellphones were seized, and the vehicle is being checked to determine whether it is stolen property or not.
One of the firearms recovered has been found to have been stolen in Colenso in 2002.
Acting provincial commissioner Major-General Bheki Langa applauded the police officers responsible for the swift arrests.
“Their quick thinking foiled the robbery that could have been violent and resulted in loss of innocent lives. The recovered firearm will be sent for ballistic tests to establish if it was used in any other crimes in the province. We always appreciate information from members of the community that helps in curbing crime in their areas,” he said.
