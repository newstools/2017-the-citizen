				                 A fire that broke out on the slopes of Table mountain near Camps Bay was not threatening any lives or danger on Friday afternoon, the Cape Town City Fire Service said on Friday.
The fire came close to the luxury Twelve Apostles Hotel on Tuesday night leading to guests there having to be evacuated.
The National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) were called in to assist with vehicles to transport guest to nearby hotels.
The NSRI also towed, via one of the vessels, a fire pump to help dampen down the area. The fire is currently burning high up the mountain slopes, and is mostly inaccessible to the firefighters. A helicopter from the SA air force was also helping to water bomb the area.
Meanwhile, firefighters responded to another vegetation fire at high-level road, just below Signal Hill at lunchtime on Friday.
“Currently, we have five fire engines, and three tenders on the scene,” said the City’s Fire and Rescue services Edward Bosch.
Bosch said the cause of the fire was undetermined at the stage.
