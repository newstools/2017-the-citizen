				                 Despite an extensive sea, air, and shoreline search no sign has been found of a man who went missing in rough sea after a dive at Bantry Bay on Cape Town’s Atlantic seaboard on Sunday, the National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) said.
NSRI Bakoven deputy station commander Luke van Riet said duty crew were activated by the Transnet National Ports Authority (TNPA) at about 11.20am following reports of a diver missing following a dive with his brother at Bantry Bay.
It appeared that while the brothers were exiting the water after a dive in rough sea conditions the missing man’s brother was able to get out of the surf onto rocks but his brother, a 32-year-old man from Grassy Park, went missing and bystanders raised the alarm, he said.
The sea rescue craft Rotarian Schipper, nearby at Clifton Beach on a routine training operation at the time, immediately diverted to respond to the scene and a search operation commenced.
NSRI Bakoven rescue swimmers, the Cape Town fire and rescue services dive unit, the Western Cape government health EMS rescue squad, Life Healthcare response paramedics, City of Cape Town law enforcement, and the South African Police Service (SAPS) and a police dive unit responded.
“An extensive search revealed no sign of the missing man and the EMS/AMS Skymed rescue helicopter responded to assist in the search, but despite the extensive sea, air, and shoreline search operation no sign of the man has been found. A police dive unit will continue with an ongoing search operation. Family are being assisted by police and police have opened an investigation,” Van Riet said.
