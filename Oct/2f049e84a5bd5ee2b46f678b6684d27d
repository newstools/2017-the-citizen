				                 The SACP’s first deputy general secretary, Solly Mapaila, on Tuesday questioned whether President Jacob Zuma could be ‘delusional’ after reshuffling his Cabinet for the second time this year ahead of the ANC’s national conference in December.
Blade Nzimande, the SACP’s general secretary, was axed from his post as the minister of higher education and training and replaced with former home affairs minister Hlengiwe Mkhize.
“I know I’ll be attacked for this, but I must say this,” Mapaila said while addressing the media in Johannesburg. “You know when someone is delusional, he [Zuma] has no sense or reason. And sometimes, you feel some of his decisions are bordering on that framework.”
According to Mapaila, Cabinet does not belong to Zuma but the ANC and its alliance partners, Cosatu, the SACP and Sanco.
“We participate in the elections through the alliance as the SACP. We fight together in the trenches with the ANC. We give the mandate to the party [ANC] through a party political system,” he said.
“President Zuma did not stand on his own and win elections. It is the ANC-led alliance that won the elections, and we appointed him as president of the ANC and country to process that mandate, therefore Cabinet does not belong to him,” Mapaila added.
Mapaila said it was quite clear that Zuma had “detached himself from the ANC”.
“Many of his actions ANC leaders can’t defend them. From NEC [national executive committee] decisions to several other platforms, he differs constantly with his own organisation, and this is where the major problem is.”
Mapaila said Zuma’s latest changes to the executive would have wider implications on the tripartite alliance. He lambasted the president for having no regard for the unity of the alliance.
