The note, on the stationary of the Imperial Hotel Tokyo, says in German that “a quiet and modest life brings more joy than a pursuit of success bound with constant unrest.”
A second Einstein note written at the same time that simply reads “where there’s a will, there’s a way” sold for $240,000, according to Winner’s.
