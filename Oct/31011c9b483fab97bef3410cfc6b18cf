				                 Two former ANC Youth League (ANCYL) members from Gauteng and North West have reportedly challenged league president Collen Maine’s eligibility to be a member of the governing party’s structure – let alone its president.
eNCA reports that the pair delivered their grievances in a lawyer’s letter to the ANC’s headquarters Luthuli House in Johannesburg, arguing that Maine, who they have estimated to be 38 years old, is way too old and should give up his post.
They are calling for intervention from the mother body to ensure the party sticks to the ANCYL’s constitution, which states that the position is open to all South African youth between the ages of 14 and 35.
“The correct position is that he should surrender his membership of the ANC Youth League and resign from the position of President. To the extent that there is any dispute about his age, we request that he provide us with his correct date of birth and any evidence to this effect,” the lawyer’s letter stated.
“We specifically require that he provide us with either a copy of his birth certificate or his identification document. Failure to provide this information will lead us to the inevitable conclusion that our clients’ estimation about age is in fact correct.”
Maine was elected uncontested as the ANCYL’s president during the league’s national conference back in 2015. At the time, he was an MEC in the North West and has been closely associated with President Jacob Zuma’s supporters in the ANC.
One of the people behind the demand is known as Thabo Arrafat Molamu, who is apparently believed to have been close to Maine at some point.
