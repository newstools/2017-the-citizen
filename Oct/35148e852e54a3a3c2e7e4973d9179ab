				                 Mango Airlines said several of its flights have been affected after pilots downed tools on Monday morning over a wage dispute.
 
“Mango would like to advise that as far as possible all guests have been informed that their travel arrangements have been affected,” the airline said in a statement.
 
“The airline is doing everything possible to mitigate strike action on its operations.”
 
Trade union Solidarity, which said it represents 95 percent of the pilots at Mango, said the strike followed a collapse in wage talks.
 
On Sunday night Solidarity deputy general secretary, Deon Reyneke, said: “Notwithstanding the reality that Mango pilots are paid significantly less than the industry standard, management showed no interest whatsoever to negotiate with its employees.
 
“Mango’s management would not give an inch, confirming that it would not revisit its initial offer of six percent, while the trade union was prepared to adjust its mandate in a bid to let negotiations succeed.”  
 
Mango said it would continue to engage Solidarity to try and bring the industrial action to an end.
 
The airline said information on the status of its flights can be obtained from either www.flymango.com @FlyMangoSA and https://web.facebook.com/FlyMangoSA/
