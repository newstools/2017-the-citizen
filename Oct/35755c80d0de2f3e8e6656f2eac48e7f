				                 A KZN Chinese delegation, acting on behalf of the greater Durban Chinese community, has taken a public stand to protecting the endangered rhinos in Zululand, Zululand Observer reports.
On Saturday, the Consul General of China, Jianzhou Wang, handed over a cheque of R120 000 to Thula Thula Private Game Reserve to be used for ‘the conservation and protection of wildlife’.
“We have an old Chinese teaching that says ‘Do not fail to do good – even if it is small, and do not engage in evil – even if it is small – no matter how small it is. And in my view, poaching is evil,” he said.

“China wants to contribute to the ecological security of the world, and has made positive changes by banning the import of African ivory and carbon products into our country,” said Wang during a media briefing at Thula Thula, the culmination of an educational trip through the Reserve and the wildlife sanctuary.
