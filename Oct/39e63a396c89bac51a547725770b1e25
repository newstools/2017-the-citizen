ER24 paramedics arrived on the scene and found an elderly man lying outside. Local security forces were already on the scene, ER24 spokesman Russel Meiring said.
“Paramedics assessed the man and found that he had showed no signs of life. Unfortunately, nothing could be done for the man and he was declared dead on the scene.
“It is understood that three gunmen had entered the property when a scuffle ensued. Local authorities were on the scene and will launch an investigation,” Meiring said.
