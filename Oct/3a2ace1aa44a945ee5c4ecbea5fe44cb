				                 The murder trial involving Christopher Panayiotou and his two co-accused will resume in the Port Elizabeth High Court on Monday.
The State has indicated that it would bring an application to reopen its case.
It was not immediately clear if Panayiotou’s alleged mistress Chanelle Coutts will be called as a defence witness. The defence said that she had to take leave from work in order to be at court to testify.
The state alleges that Sinethemba Nemembe assisted Sizwe Vumazonke to kidnap and murder Jayde at the behest of her husband during April 2015.
Jayde was driven to a remote area on the outskirts of Kwanobuhle, where the alleged murder took place. The state contends Vumazonke fired two shots through Jayde’s back and a final shot through her head. Vumazonke has since died.
Zolani Sibeko was the last suspect to be arrested, 15 months after the murder. He was apparently placed – through cellphone mapping – outside Jayde’s complex in the days before her murder.
