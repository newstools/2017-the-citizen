“According to reliable sources she flew from South Africa to Heathrow International Airport in London on July 29,” DA Gauteng MPL Jack Bloom said.
“It is essential that she accounts for her actions as she insisted on cancelling the Esidimeni contract for mental health patients despite warnings that this would result in disaster. She also intimidated officials in the transfer of patients to illegally registered NGOs where they died, and tried to cover up what was happening,” he said.
Relatives of the over 100 deceased patients were unanimous that she be summonsed to the arbitration hearings and their wishes should be respected. They would not have closure until they heard the full truth from “the person most responsible for this immense human tragedy”.
“I hope that Justice Dikgang Moseneke gets her London address from the university and does what is legally necessary for her to appear before him, probably at a special sitting, as the hearings are due to conclude this week,” Bloom said.
