				                 It can be depressing to wonder whether there will ever be an investigation into allegations of state capture and corruption.
There seems to be a whole network of defenders closing ranks around President Zuma – and by association, his friends, the Guptas – to delay or derail any probe.
Whether it’s the National Prosecuting Authority or the Hawks, there seems to be a combination of lethargy and incompetence when it comes to getting to the bottom of the rot.
It does sometimes seem as though certain people, and certain families, are untouchable in South Africa.
However, in these days of globalised crimes – and there have been plenty of allegations that ill-gotten gains from South Africa have either been stashed or laundered offshore – it is comforting to know that law enforcement knows no international borders either.
So there’s welcome news that the Americans and British are looking into allegations of corruption and illegal conduct by the Gupta family and their network.
The US Federal Bureau of Investigation is reportedly investigating two Gupta family members who have American citizenship, and alleged money flows to and from the United States by Gupta-linked companies.
American law empowers investigators from a number of different agencies to look into allegations of money-laundering or corruption involving US currency.
Given that the US dollar is the lifeblood of most international criminal networks, this means the Americans can investigate far and wide.
And they have teeth, too, as they demonstrated recently when the assets of a corrupt former Nigerian minister were seized.
The British authorities are also probing possible irregular conduct in money transfers via Gupta-linked companies and banks based in the United Kingdom.
While justice in this country may grind exceedingly slow, it doesn’t elsewhere. Soon, there will be few places the corrupt can enjoy their ill-gotten gains in peace.
