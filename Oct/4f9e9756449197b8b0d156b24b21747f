				                 Police in Motetema at Groblesdal have cracked a possible crime syndicate in the Tafelkop area at Dikgalaopeng village and arrested two men for being in possession of suspected stolen property worth over R1 million, Limpopo police said on Saturday.
Two men, aged 29 and 42, were arrested after a tip-off from members of the community about a suspicious truck spotted off-loading groceries at a local shop at midnight on Friday, Lt-Col Moatshe Ngoepe said.
“Reacting to the tip-off, the police on arrival at the said shop found the duo busy off-loading the stock. The necessary documents were demanded to prove the legality of the items, but they failed to produce any and were immediately arrested.”
The items recovered were estimated to be worth over R1 million and included foam bath, toothpaste, Sta-soft, and bath soap. The police investigation was continuing and the two men would appear in the Motetema Magistrate’s Court on Monday on charges related to the possession of suspected stolen property, Ngoepe said.
