				                 Manufacturing production in South Africa increased by 1.5 percent year-on-year in August, after having contracted in the preceding four consecutive months, Statistics South Africa (StatsSA) said on Tuesday.
In August, only four of the ten manufacturing divisions registered positive growth.
StatsSA said this increase was mainly due to higher production in the basic iron and steel, non-ferrous metal products, metal products and machinery division at 11.3 percent and contributing two percentage points owing to the lift in global commodity prices.
The basic iron and steel division has sustained positive growth in the year to date but this has been insufficient to counter the underperformance of the remaining sectors, with manufacturing production contracting by 1.2 percent year-on-year in the first eight months of the year.
Investec economist Kamilla Kaplan said that over the last year, the performance of the South African manufacturing sector has diverged from global manufacturing production, which has strengthened.
“The global PMI and export orders have consistently remained in expansionary territory since mid-2016, suggesting improving momentum in both global production and trade. The comparative underperformance of the local manufacturing sector can be linked to persistently weak domestic demand conditions,” Kaplan said.
