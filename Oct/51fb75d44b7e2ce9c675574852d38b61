				                 With less than two months left until the ANC’s 54th national conference, North West has become the first province to endorse Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma as its presidential candidate.
The Sowetan reports that the province agreed it would back her to succeed President Jacob Zuma as ANC leader at the weekend during its provincial general council.
Dlamini-Zuma’s slate reportedly includes Mpumalanga premier and ANC chairperson David Mabuza as her deputy.
So far the former AU chairperson has received the support of the ANC Youth League and the ANC Women’s League, including the backing of her ex-husband.
Her rival Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa already has the support of Northern Cape and Limpopo, as well as the ANC’s alliance partners Cosatu, the South African Communist Party, and the South African Civic Organisation.
Other ANC presidential hopefuls include the party’s treasurer-general Zweli Mkhize, Minister of Human Settlements Lindiwe Sisulu, ANC national chairperson and speaker of parliament Baleka Mbete, Minister in the Presidency Jeff Radebe, and former ANC treasurer-general Mathews Phosa.
The ANC will hold its national congress in Gauteng from 16 to 20 December.
Earlier this month, the governing party instructed its branches across the country to start nominating delegates for the conference. The ANC also allocated each province a certain number of delegates on a proportionality basis, with Kwazulu-Natal and Mpumalanga boosting the most delegates to take to the conference.
