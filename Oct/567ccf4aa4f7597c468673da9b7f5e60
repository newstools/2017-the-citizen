				                 De Villiers smacked 176 off 104 balls as South Africa posted an imposing 353 for six after being sent in to bat.
De Villiers raced to his 25th one-day international century off 68 balls with ten fours and a six. He added another five fours and six sixes off the next 36 deliveries before he hit a low full toss from Rubel Hossain to deep midwicket with 14 balls remaining in the innings.
The ease with which De Villiers found the boundary was in complete contrast to his teammates, who managed to hit only five fours and a six between them, struggling to time the ball as it rose slowly off the surface, while the outfield was unusually slow after three days of rain.
De Villiers dominated stands of 136 off 111 balls for the third wicket with Hashim Amla (85) and 111 off 70 balls for the fourth wicket with JP Duminy (30).
Rubel Hossain took three wickets in his last two overs to finish with four for 62.
