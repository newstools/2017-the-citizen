				                 Over 100 lolly pipes used to smoke crystal meth were seized during the city of Joburg crime prevention raid conducted at two properties in Turffontein, south of Johannesburg.
The two properties, Thelma Court and Nola are, according to Johannesburg Metropolitan Police Department (JMPD), notorious for sales of drugs and other criminal activities.
The operation was led by the Forensic and Investigation Services unit assisted by the South African Police Service (SAPS), department of Home Affairs and JMPD.
The SAPS also confiscated 2042 still pain tablets and various other scheduled tablets from one individual.  An investigation will be conducted to establish why the individual was in possession of such a high quantity of medication.

However, no arrests were made during the operation with the spokesperson for forensic and investigation services Lucky Sindane telling the media it is suspected that the information about the crime prevention operation was leaked to the dealers operating on the two properties.
“The city will not leave any stone un-turned when dealing with criminal activities within its area of jurisdiction. We will continue to intensify our crime prevention operations at bad and hijacked properties with the assistance of the SAPS and other law enforcement agencies.
“It is essential that we bring back the rule of law in our city and take it back from the criminal elements. We are committed to ensuring that this City becomes a prosperous and inclusive place for our people to live work and play,” said Joburg executive mayor Herman Mashaba.
