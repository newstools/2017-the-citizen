				                 Trainer Vaughan Marshall had three winners last Wednesday at Durbanville and could have another two today at the same course as both Red Eight In Race 1 and The Secret Is Out in Race 2 look likely winners.
Grade 1 winning filly, The Secret Is Out, was not quite as good as a three-year-old in comparison to her very smart two-year-old career but she remains a class act and if anywhere near peak fitness could prove too smart for her rivals in a Conditions Plate over 1000m where she is well in at the weights.
Admittedly Marshallâ€™s filly is returning from a 137-day break and has bigger races as her target but a nice confidence-boosting win will do her the world of good.
Jockey MJ Byleveld knows the filly well and can keep her handy from a good draw. Blinkers were added to The Secret Is Out when winning in April and the Captain Al four-year-old followed that up with a smashing third behind Carry On Alice over the Scottsville 1200m in the Grade 1 SA Fillies Sprint.
None of her rivals can remotely considered in her class but over 1000m at this track anything is possible and there are four runners who could be possible dangers.
What A Winter gelding Red Eight has been runner-up in his last three starts and clearly deserves a win. He tried hard when only 0.75 lengths behind Johnny Black over this 1200m last month. Red Eight could get the run of the race from a decent draw.
Clearly the biggest threat to him is Love Of India.
