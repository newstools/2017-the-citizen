“Learners must not panic during the exams, they must just relax. All they need to do is to prepare well, do revisions, eat well, and get sufficient sleep. We have no doubt that they will do well and put Bokone Bophirima [North West] on the map,” he said wishing the pupils well in their examinations.
“The province is satisfied with the state of readiness for the exams. This includes the tight security for all the 497,640 papers to be written. Marking of the grade 12 papers will commence from the 4th to 13th December 2017 in 16 marking venues in the province. The Minister of Basic Education Angie Motshekga will announce the matric results on the 4th January 2018 and MEC for education and sports development Sello Lehari will announce the provincial results on the 5th January 2018,” he said.
Mahumapelo believed that teachers and the department had done their best this year and the province looked forward to improved results. Two grade 12 pupils would write the German exam on Monday, and the rest of the 36,402 candidates would start on Tuesday with an English paper in 411 exam centres across the province.
