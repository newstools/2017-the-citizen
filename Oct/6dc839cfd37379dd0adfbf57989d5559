Netcare 911 responded at about 4.20pm to reports of a serious car crash on the N3 in the direction of Durban about 1km past the Cato Ridge off-ramp, Netcare 911 spokesman Nick Dollman said.
“Reports from the scene indicate that one vehicle was involved in the rollover crash. The incident and preceding events will form part of a police investigation,” he said.
Paramedics attended to four people at the scene. A man and a woman had sustained relatively minor to moderate injuries and were stabilised at the scene before being transported by another ambulance service to hospital for further assessment and care. A third occupant also sustained relatively minor injuries and refused the assistance offered by the paramedics.
The fourth victim was ejected from the vehicle and sustained severe injuries. The 24-year-old man died at the scene, Dollman said.
