				                 Police Minister Fikile Mbalula needs to take steps to ensure the South African Police Service (SAPS) is “professionalised” to effectively counter rampant crime in the county, the Democratic Alliance said on Saturday.
The DA’s oversight visit to the Nyanga police station in Cape Town on Sunday morning was a sad reminder that the SAPS was not given what they needed at station level to do their jobs and bring down the unacceptably high level of crime in the country, DA spokesman Zakhele Mbhele said.
With the annual crime statistics due to be released on Tuesday, the fact remained that the SAPS was chronically under-trained, under-staffed, under-resourced, and under-equipped – the four Us – a pervasively shoddy state of affairs rooted in poor leadership with often skewed priorities. This was one of the main reasons why the SAPS was not a professional service that could effectively fight crime and keep South Africans safe, he said.
At the end of the day, Mbalula was the one who decided on where resources for the SAPS were allocated. Mbalula would do well to “step outside of his Twitter universe” and address the four Us and ensure fit-for-purpose top brass in the police.
Regardless of whether or not Tuesday’s crime statistics increased or decreased, “we can all agree that crime in our country is unacceptably high”.
“When Mbalula addresses the public on Tuesday, the DA fully expects him to present a detailed plan of how he intends to ensure the SAPS are professionalised by addressing the major shortcomings of the four Us, rooted in poor leadership, so that they can deliver on their mandate of bringing down crime and keeping South Africans safe.
“In a place like Nyanga, and far too many other communities across the country, people cannot walk down the street without fearing for their safety and their lives. With a population of approximately 58,000 residents (and growing) and the highest contact crime levels in the country this is a police precinct that should be among the best-resourced and adequately staffed,” Mbhele said.
Instead, on its visit on Sunday the DA found major personnel and infrastructural shortfalls:
– The posts for sector commanders remained vacant;
– The station was unable to have at least two crime prevention vehicles per sector on patrol;
– Inadequate detention cells led to overcrowding;
– There were delays in vehicles coming out of the SAPS garages after repairs or maintenance; and
– Some detectives had caseloads of more than 200 dockets, even up to 230.
“We will never be able to address this national crisis unless Mbalula commits to tackling the four Us head-on by bringing police leadership up to necessary competence standards and making sure the SAPS have what they need to make South Africa safe,” Mbhele said.
