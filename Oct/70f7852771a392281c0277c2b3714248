				                 The Tshwane Metro Police Department (TMPD) on Tuesday cautioned road users to exercise caution amidst the severe weather coupled with heavy rain.
“Motorists and pedestrians are advised to avoid driving and walking through flooded roads or bridges. They are also advised to reduce speed,” TMPD spokesperson Nonhlanhla Mgiba said.
When caught up in the severe weather, Mgiba said motorists are encouraged to switch on headlamps.
“If the rain is too heavy, park the vehicle where it is safe and wait for the rain to clear,” she said.
“Our officers are deployed especially in areas with low water bridges like Capital Park. [In the event of massive rainfall] they close off the road and redirect motor vehicles.”
Tshwane has been experiencing heavy rains over the past few days, but Mgiba said so far there has been “no major problems” reported on the capital city’s roads, except for car crashes.
The TMPD warned that areas to avoid during heavy storms in the city include the Hennops River low water bridge, Nellmapius and John Voster Drive, the Ben Schoeman highway between Snake valley and N14 in Centurion.
In the northern parts of the city, the TMPD advised motorists to avoid Willem Cruywagen Street in Akasia, Daan De Wit Nel Drive in Pretoria North, and Amandelboom street in Sinoville during severe weather.
