Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the UN health agency, this week asked Zimbabwe’s 93-year-old authoritarian leader to serve in the role to help tackle non-communicable diseases such as heart attacks, strokes and asthma across Africa.
The decision triggered confusion and anger among key WHO member states and activists who noted that Zimbabwe’s health care system, like many of its public services, has collapsed under Mugabe’s regime.
Faced with a wage of criticism over the appointment, Ghebreyesus said Saturday that he was “rethinking” his decision.
