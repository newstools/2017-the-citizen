Dar es Salaam. Controversial Kenyan rapper CMB Prezzo was left embarrassed after his attempt to hit on famous Bongo Flava socialite and video vixen Amber Lulu hit a snag as he was friend-zoned. A video that has been doing rounds showed Prezzo trying to get cozy with the bootylious video queen, first inside a car and then in a hotel room. The videos made many to believe that the two must have started some kind of a romance, barely two months after Prezzo was dumped by his girlfriend of two years socialite Michelle Yola, who is now pregnant. However, according to the vixen, who is a lookalike to famous American socialite Amber Rose, Prezzo advances on her bore no fruits. Lulu insisted that the rapper was just a friend and there was nothing more than that despite having been in the same hotel room for some time. Lulu’s sentiments were backed up by her close friend and fellow video vixen Gigy Money who referred to Prezzo as a “nagging lice”.
