				                 Five-time winner Kilrain, who showed smart progress in his three runs at Turffontein since joining Mike de Kock’s stable, has a bright chance to make a winning debut in KwaZulu-Natal tonight when teamed up with top-flight Anton Marcus for the first time in the Jonsson Workwear Michaelmas Handicap (Listed) over 1900m at the Greyville Polytrack.
Coming off a three-month rest this son of Dynasty was a fast-finishing third over 1400m and followed up with a fluent win over 1600m. Then stepping up in distance and carrying 59.5kg the six-year-old was not disgraced in finishing third in an 1800m MR 90 Handicap as he did not have a trouble-free run.
Marcus takes over from Callan Murray and with 3kg less to shoulder and being well drawn the gelding is unlikely to misfire. His main rivals are Chicago Beat, Mr O’Neill, No Worries and Techno Captain.
There is a chance to make quick money in Race 1 when speedy World Dreamer teams up with Marcus again. The combination was touched off last time at the Polytrack over 1200m and should not miss over 1000m.
Another one to follow is Tommy Grand (Anthony Delpech) in Race 6. The gelding justified favouritism last time and with a good draw should complete the Polytrack double. He rates a banker in all TAB exotic bets.
