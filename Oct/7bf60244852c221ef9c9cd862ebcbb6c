				                 Scores of activists were gathering at a Mamelodi secondary school, east of Pretoria on Monday, ahead of Gauteng MEC for Education Panyaza Lesufi MEC Lesufi’s visit following reports of sexual assault on a learner.
Scores of women in T-shirts written “Siyavuma”, “CR17” and ANC were at the school ahead of Lesufi’s arrival. Several members Congress of SA Students (Cosas)  and #NotInMyName support group were also at the school.
#NotInMyName’s Themba Masango said his organisation has had interactions with the learner, and provided support.
Around 11 am, Lesufi arrived at the school and began his meeting with school officials and provincial education officials.
In another horrific revelation it emerged last week that the number of pupils sexually assaulted at a Soweto school allegedly by a scholar patroller had increased to 87.
“It is disappointing that we keep receiving such depressing information from our officials who are hard at work conducting necessary counselling at the said school,” Lesufi said.
