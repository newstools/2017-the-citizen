				                 The Federation of Unions of South Africa (FEDUSA) on Thursday welcomed the axing of controversial South African Airways (SAA) chairwwoman Dudu Myeni.
On Wednesday, Cabinet approved sweeping changes to the SAA board and replaced Myeni with Johannes Bhekumuzi Magwaza.
Magwaza would be deputised by Nolitha Fakude.
According to Fedusa, the dumping of Myeni came at a good time for the troubled national carrier as Vuyani Jarana takes the reins as SAA chief executive from November 1.
FEDUSA general secretary Dennis George said the removal of Myeni would give Jarana the vital operational space he needed to implement a turnaround plan for SAA.
“Such a step has long been coming to bring SAA back from the brink of doom to eventual profitability and will also allow government to stop the heavy bleeding of scarce fiscus resources in the form of state guarantees and to channel those wasted resources to stalled development projects, and to address vital corporate governance issues,” said George.
“To allow the status quo to continue would have been to continue feeding the insatiable state capture beast that has wreaked havoc in our country and will bequeath an intolerable financial burden on future generations.”
