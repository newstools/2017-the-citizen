				                 A 48-year-old man was under police guard in hospital after he was shot and wounded in Vyfhoek near Potchefstroom on Thursday, North West police said.
Spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Adéle Myburgh said the man was arrested following an incident in which three men were found exiting a house which was broken into in the early hours of Thursday morning.
“According to information available at this stage, the owner of the small holding heard a sound of a breaking glass at a neighbouring house and went to investigate. Upon investigation, the suspects exited the house with objects they had in their possession.”
A shot was fired and one of the men was wounded. The others two fled the scene.
The injured man got medical treatment on the scene and was taken to hospital where he was admitted under police guard. Some of the objects stolen from the house were recovered,  she said.
He was expected to appear in the  Potchefstroom Magistrate’s Court, facing charges of burglary residential as soon as he was released from hospital.
