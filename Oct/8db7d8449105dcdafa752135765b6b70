				                 The deputy director-general of communications in the Gauteng office of the premier and spokesperson for the provincial government, Thabo Masebe, has reiterated to The Citizen that the provincial government has the political willingness to ensure all those required to give evidence at Life Esidimeni do so.
Masebe had earlier in the morning told The Citizen the provincial government would not interfere with the process, as it was the responsibility of the abritrator, retired deputy chief justice Dikgang Moseneke.
“As government, we will do anything to assist the ADR [alternative dispute resolution] process. We will do anything to bring any government official or politician to appear before the ADR,” he told The Citizen.
“We will do whatever possible within the law to ensure that any official that was fired attends the hearing. We have assured the arbitrator that whoever must appear before the ADR, we will assist.” When asked if that included Mahlangu, Masebe said yes.
