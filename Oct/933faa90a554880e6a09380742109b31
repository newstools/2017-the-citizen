				                 Tomorrow’s third and final one-day international against Bangladesh in East London provides the perfect chance for the national cricket team to blood their youngsters.
Having already wrapped up the three-match series – which saw South Africa rise to number one in the world rankings, with one match to play – why not hand a few of the young guns a start?
With bigger tests against India and Australia still to come in an action-packed season, having a look at what fringe players can bring to the table can only benefit South African cricket.
After crushing 333-run and an innings and 254-run victories in the Test series, the Proteas followed it up with a dominant 10-wicket win in Bloemfontein and a 104-run triumph in Paarl in the first two limited overs matches.
Even if coach Ottis Gibson decides to rest some of his senior players, the Tigers have provided little reason to expect an end to the lopsidedness of their tour.
Aiden Markram, who made scores of 97, 15 and 143 in his first three Test innings against Bangladesh, is expected to make his debut in the place of the rested Hashim Amla tomorrow, while all-rounder Wiaan Mulder should be given a chance to show what he is made of after solid performances domestically. It should make for an interesting day of cricket.
