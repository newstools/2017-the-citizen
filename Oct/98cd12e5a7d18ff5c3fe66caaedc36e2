“The provincial task team members survived gunshots at the hands of five alleged hijackers in the KwaDabeka area,” Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said on Sunday.
“Police retaliated by fatally wounding three of the five suspects and recovering three pistols. Two other suspects managed to flee the scene on foot and police are still searching for them,” Mbhele said.
Police were conducting an operation in KwaDabeka at about 8.45pm aimed at preventing criminal activities. The officers were driving along Khululeka Road when they spotted a vehicle with five occupants and instructed them to stop, but the occupants fired at them with pistols and rifles.
Police retaliated and three alleged hijackers were shot dead. Upon investigating, police discovered that the suspects’ vehicle was hijacked in Newlands West earlier this month. A case of attempted murder was opened at KwaDabeka police station for investigation, Mbhele said.
“We are thrilled that police officers escaped the shooting unscathed and managed to remove illegal firearms at the hands of criminals,” KwaZulu-Natal acting police commissioner Maj-Gen Bheki Langa said.
“The recovered firearms will be subjected for ballistic testing to ascertain if they were used in any other crime in the country. We will ensure that the fled suspects are apprehended immediately,” he said.
