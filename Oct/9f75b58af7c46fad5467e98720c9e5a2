				                 Three people have shot and wounded at Umlazi’s notorious Glebelands Hostel, police said on Monday.
The shootings occurred on Friday at about 10pm, just hours after the Moerane Commission announced it had been granted an extension to investigate political killings in the province. Commission witnesses have testified that many of the killings at the hostel were politically motivated.
Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said: “They sustained shot wounds and were taken to hospital for medical attention. The motive is unknown. Charges of attempted murder were opened at Umlazi Police Station for investigation.”
The hostel, south of Durban, has been the object of intense scrutiny throughout the commission. Testifying on behalf of the KZN African National Congress, chairman Sihle Zikalala on Friday called the protracted violence at Glebelands “a sore point” for the ruling party.
The commission was supposed to wrap-up last week, but it sought and was granted an extension by Premier Willies Mchunu until March 2018.
Mchunu established the commission last year, with the intention of investigating political killings and other political violence since 2011.
It held its first public hearing on 20 March.
