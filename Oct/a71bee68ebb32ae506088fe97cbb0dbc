				                 Orlando Pirates Football Club defender, Happy Jele, is expected to appear at the Randburg Magistrate’s Court on Thursday.
Jele was granted statutory bail of R1000 by the Sandton police station after he was caught driving at 223km per hr on the M1 highway near Sandton on September 4.
On September 5, Jele briefly appeared in the court facing charges of reckless driving and exceeding the prescribed speed limit of 120km/h. The case was postponed for further investigation and his bail was extended.
After his arrest, Jele issued an apology for his “recklessness” and said he took full responsibility for his actions. He apologised the the public, the Club and supporters and said he realised the number of people he disappointed.
