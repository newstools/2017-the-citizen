“For the current crisis, I have upped the ante to $10 million,” he wrote. “Make no mistake, I fully intend to pay this entire sum.”
The top of the ad, written in all caps, reads simply: “$10 MILLION FOR INFORMATION LEADING TO THE IMPEACHMENT AND REMOVAL FROM OFFICE OF DONALD J. TRUMP.”
It goes on to question the legitimacy of Trump’s election and lists offenses ranging from Trump’s alleged collusion with Russian meddling in the US election to his sabotaging the Paris climate accord.
“But most worrisome is that, long before climate-change apocalypse strikes, Trump might trigger a nuclear world war,” he wrote.
“Impeachment would be a messy, contentious affair, but the alternative — three more years of destabilizing dysfunction — is worse.”
The ad lists an email contact and a hotline, which the Post reported would be staffed on weekdays, 8:30 am to 6 pm, for the next two weeks.
