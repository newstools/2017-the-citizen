				                 The suspects were arrested on Friday afternoon at Willowvale town, Captain Jackson Manatha said.
“Police saw a suspicious motor vehicle. The driver of the vehicle sped off as the police were about to search it. A chase ensued and the vehicle was caught. The firearm and ammunition were found inside the vehicle of the suspects.”
The firearm, a pistol, would be sent for ballistic testing to establish whether it had been used in the commission of crime. Both suspects would appear in the Willowvale Magistrate’s Court on Monday, Manatha said.
