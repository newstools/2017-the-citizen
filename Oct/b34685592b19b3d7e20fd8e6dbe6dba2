				                 Inkatha Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi, 88, will step down from the party’s leadership at its next elective conference.
Buthelezi has been IFP leader since the party’s inception in 1975. He made the announcement at the IFP’s extended national council meeting in Durban on Sunday.
During a meeting of about 500 party members on Sunday, members were asked to offer themselves for position of party leader, but no one came forward.
“The Extended National Council considered the matter of leadership extensively and resolved to appeal to Prince Buthelezi to offer guidance and wisdom to whomever the nominated preferential candidate of the Extended National Council is.
“The delegates were given an opportunity to express their willingness to accept nomination for the president position.
“None offered themselves, after which Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi presented a proposal agreed to by the IFP National Executive Committee that Mayor of Big 5-Hlabisa, Mr Velenkosini Hlabisa, current KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Secretary be endorsed as the presidential candidate nominee at the National General Conference of the party,” reads the party’s statement.
Hlabisa would not assume presidency immediately, but would be the first candidate put forward.
