New York, UNITED STATES | AFP/. Beyonce's Spanish-language remix of "MiGente" for hurricane relief opened Wednesday on top of the US Latin song chart, finally dethroning the global mega-hit "Despacito." "MiGente," which Colombian reggaeton star J Balvin created from the African dance rhythms of French DJ Willy William, had lingered for 11 weeks at number two on the Billboard Latin song chart underneath the colossus of "Despacito." "MiGente" finally reached the top spot for the week through October 5 in the track's new version starring Beyonce, who sings partially in Spanish in her first music since giving birth to twins in June. Beyonce said that all proceeds of the remix of "MiGente," which means "My People," would support victims of the trio of powerful hurricanes that have ravaged the Caribbean and southern United States. "Despacito" -- led by Puerto Rican star Luis Fonsi with rapper Daddy Yankee, and later with a contribution by Justin Bieber -- spent 35 weeks on top of the chart. It was the second longest reign ever, trailing Enrique Iglesias' "Bailando" which topped the chart for 41 weeks. "Despacito" earlier also made history by tying the record for most weeks at number one of the mainstream Hot 100 chart of all songs in the United States, ruling for 16 weeks. "MiGente" jumped to number three on the Hot 100 with Beyonce, but breakout rap star Cardi B held firm at number one with "Bodak Yellow."
