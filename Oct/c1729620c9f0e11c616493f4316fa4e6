				                 Minister in the Presidency Jeff Radebe today announced the appointment of the new statistician-general and head of statistics South Africa (Stats SA), Risenga Maluleke.
His appointment will take effect from the 1st of November 2017 when Dr Pali Lehohla’s tenure expires at the end of October.
Maluleke has served within Stats SA for 20 years, having joined Stats SA as a manager at Limpopo provincial office in 1997.
He is currently a deputy director-general (DDG) for statistical collections and outreach. His portfolio is responsible for Provincial Offices (responsible data collection for censuses and sample surveys), International Statistical Development as well as Communications, Marketing and Stakeholder Relations.
Maluleke obtained a BSc in Mathematical Statistics from the University of Limpopo, as well as an  MPhil  in Urban and Regional Science from Stellenbosch University. He also completed as Senior Executive Programmes with Wits and Harvard Business Schools.
Outgoing statistician-general Dr Pali Lehohla is elated with the choice of his successor.
“In Risenga, we have a well-grounded leader with balance, instilling fairness and justice in all his dealings, he has enduring strength, he imbues humility, he is a servant leader, a village boy who, with agility, adapts to metropoles of the world, and who is ready to take on any adversity with a singularly determined mind for finding solutions.
“My success in leading and building this mighty organisation would not have been possible if Risenga was not leading with me in the most treacherous of waters. My relay is done, I am passing the baton to a well-tested professional and leader.”
Stats SA thanked Dr Pali Lehohla for his dedicated leadership over the years, his immense contribution to Stats SA, the statistics fraternity in the region and the world over.
