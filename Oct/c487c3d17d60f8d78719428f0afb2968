				                 Nolan Hoffman again used his lightning speed to win a bunch sprint on Sunday, writing his name into the record books at the Tsogo Sun Amashova Durban Classic road race in KwaZulu-Natal.
The Team BCX rider outclassed a quality local field to complete the 106km race in 2:20:07.
After a superb effort from his professional outfit, who managed to control the contest by preventing a successful breakaway on the challenging course, Hoffman edged out Clint Hendricks of the Road Cover squad.
Hendricks’ teammate, Ryan Harris, was credited with the same time in third place.
Hoffman, a former World Championships medalist on the track and two-time Cape Town Cycle Tour winner, racked up his sixth Amashova victory to equal the record number of titles held by retired elite rider Malcolm Lange.
In the women’s battle, Carla Oberholzer earned a convincing win, breaking away to take her maiden Amashova title more than three minutes clear of her nearest opponent, securing a clean sweep for the Demacon team.
Defending champion Kim le Court of Mauritius took second position, beating South African champion Heidi Dalton in a dash for the line.
