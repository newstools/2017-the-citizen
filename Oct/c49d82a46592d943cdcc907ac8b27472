Paramedics from ER24 and other services attended the scene at about 3pm where they found the cash vehicle on its side next to the road, ER24 spokesman Werner Vermaak said.
“One of the occupants was found a few metres away from the vehicle. It is believed that he was ejected from the back of the vehicle when it overturned. An emergency medical helicopter was called to the scene to airlift him to hospital.
“Paramedics and firefighters had to use several rescue tools to free the driver [who] was still trapped in the front of the vehicle. They managed to break open the windscreen and remove the driver. He was treated for injuries ranging from scrapes and bruises to possible back and neck injuries. He was later transported to hospital.”
Police were investigating the circumstances surrounding the incident, Vermaak said.
