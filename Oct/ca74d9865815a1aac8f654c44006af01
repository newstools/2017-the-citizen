The Hague-based tribunal said in August that ex-jihadist Ahmad al-Faqi al-Mahdi caused 2.7 million euros worth of damage when he destroyed several fabled shrines in Timbuktu, in northern Mali, during the jihadist takeover there in 2012.
The judges further ordered that the Malian state as well as the international community be compensated with a symbolic amount of one euro for the damages suffered.
Al-Mahdi was jailed for nine years in 2016 after he pleaded guilty to directing attacks on the UNESCO world heritage site and apologised to the Timbuktu community.
It was a landmark case for the ICC as it was the first time a jihadist had pleaded guilty to a war crimes charge.
Bensouda said the court was expanding its investigation in Mali, which is home to a 13,000-strong UN peacekeeping mission.
“I am not in position to talk about what else is being done regards to Al-Mahdi proper but all I can tell you the court is looking at other crimes within the context of our investigations in Mali,” she said.
