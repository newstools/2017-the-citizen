				                 Police in Durban arrested four alleged business robbers and seized three illegal firearms and housebreaking implements in the early hours of Sunday morning, KwaZulu-Natal police said.
Durban Central police K9 unit members were conducting an operation in the Umbilo area when a vehicle with four occupants was spotted in Moore Road, Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said.
“The occupants, who were not happy to come across police officers, were searched. Police confiscated three unlicensed firearms and housebreaking implements in their possession. All the suspects were immediately arrested and taken to Umbilo police station for detention,” Mbhele said.
Initial investigations revealed that the suspects’ vehicle was stolen from business premises during a robbery in Lancers Road in the Durban CBD two weeks ago. The suspects would be charged with possession of unlicensed firearms, possession of housebreaking implements, and possession of stolen property.
The could also be linked to the business robbery case opened at Durban Central police station. They would appear in the Durban Magistrate’s Court on Monday and the firearms would be sent for ballistic testing to determine whether they were used in any crime in the country. All three firearms had their serial numbers filed off, Mbhele said.
KwaZulu-Natal acting police commissioner Maj-Gen Bheki Langa praised the vigilance of the police officers which led to the arrest and the recovery of the firearms and the stolen vehicle.
“Police will continue to eradicate the proliferation of firearms in the province to prevent serious and violent crimes. [The] suspects will also be profiled to ascertain if they can be linked to other similar crimes in Durban and surroundings,” he said.
