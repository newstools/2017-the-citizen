ER24 paramedics, along with Life Healthcare, arrived on the scene to find the metro services already in attendance, ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring said.
“A large truck was found lying on its roof on a cliff. Traffic had already begun to backup for some distance,” he said.
Metro rescue technicians had to use various rescue equipment to stabilise the truck while paramedics assessed the patients. One man was found trapped inside the cab of the truck in a critical condition while a woman was already being treated by the metro services.
Rescue services freed the critically injured man from the cab, an operation which lasted some time. Once freed, paramedics treated the patients and provided both with advanced life support interventions before transporting them to a nearby hospital for further treatment. Local authorities were on the scene for further investigations, Meiring said.
