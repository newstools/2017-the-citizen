				                 It’s not established stars who Cricket South Africa (CSA) should be worried about following the postponement of the T20 Global League.
Veteran Proteas bowling star Dale Steyn is rather concerned over how it will affect the development of young players locally.

Various upcoming rookies were picked up by the respective franchises.
Now they’ll have to significantly review their financial prospects.
“I feel for the younger guys, the guys who were set to earn some cash and were maybe looking at buying a flat or a car,” Steyn told ESPNCricinfo at a sponsor event in Cape Town.
“The excitement gets to you, especially when you’re young and all of a sudden you get the opportunity to earn $100,000.
“Could you imagine being 21 and someone offers you 100,000 dollars and then three weeks later says, ‘oh you are not getting it anymore’. It kind of ruins your plans and hopes.”
CSA and the South African Cricketers Association (Saca) are in the process of negotiating compensation packages for players.
The total wage bill for the 144 contracted players for this year was over $10 million (R136 million) but it’s unlikely that the local federation will pay that amount given the spiralling other costs they also have to absorb.
Tony Irish, chief of Saca, also said the players union understands CSA are in a nasty pickle with finances.
Steyn believes lost income isn’t the only problem for the youngsters.
“For the older players, it does not matter so much, they are set. Someone like AB de Villiers doesn’t have to prove himself but maybe a Dane Paterson, who is just making his way and was set to earn some money. This would have been a nice platform for him and other guys. It’s unfortunate but it’s the way it is.”
