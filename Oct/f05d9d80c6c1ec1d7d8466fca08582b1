“The death of one police officer is a damage to a nation. A police officer is a custodian of safety of the country. We will work tirelessly to ensure that killers face the full might of law. We send our condolences to Masondo’s family and her soul may rest in peace,” he said.
On Friday, Masondo was at a bus stop in Bonela Road at around 6am, when four unknown suspects armed with firearms fired shots at her, provincial spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said.
“She sustained gunshot wounds to the upper body and died at the scene. Her service pistol was also taken. The motive for the killing is unknown at this stage.”
Mbhele said that a case of murder was opened at the Cato Manor police station.
