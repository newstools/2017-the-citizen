				                 The National Union of Mineworkers Youth Structure (NUM-YS) on Thursday said President Jacob Zuma’s recent Cabinet reshuffle would lead to continued instability in the South African government.
The organisation was responding to Zuma’s surprise, controversial Cabinet reshuffle on Tuesday, in which he swapped around some of his ministers and axed the South African Communist Party general secretary, Blade Nzimande, as minister of higher education.
NUM-YS said Zuma had gone past the stage of no longer caring about the country’s stability and its economic growth.
“He is currently abusing the powers vested in him by appointing ministers willy-nilly without even consulting collective leadership and alliance.”
“This proves the arrogance that our senior leadership displays towards the millions of voters that had trust and hope in this giant movement of Oliver Tambo and other progressive leaders. The ANC has no option, but must correct the further damage to the organisation,” said Bonginkosi Mrasi, NUM Youth Structure National  Secretary.
Mrasi added: “The reshuffling fails to correct or improve services at critical departments like state-owned enterprises, social development, mineral resources where so many shenanigans are taking place. As young workers, we are concerned with so much looting at Eskom and the many improper decisions taken by its board. We feel that the current minister is failing to execute her duties on that regard.”
The NUM-YS further said it had lost hope and trust in the current Mineral and Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane, who it said had done little to stave off job losses in the industry.
