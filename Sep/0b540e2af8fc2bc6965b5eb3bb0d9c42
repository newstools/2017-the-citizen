Advertising is a cut-throat industry. There s a lot to take in when you find yourself either on agency or creative s side, and both sides serve up their challenges. It s an industry notorious for the toll it takes on advertising professionals, and also for its questionable ethics. Burnout, creative blocks and ridiculous deadlines are part and parcel of what s become known as #AgencyLife, but it s still an industry I love. Nothing is original. In his book Steal Like An Artist, Austin Kleon said: &#8220;You&#8217;re an amalgamation of the art you consume, so choose wisely.&#8221; It&#8217;s no surprise that few things under the sun are original especially in the information age. I love a good ad. And a clever one even more. Two weeks ago, a video went live on Vimeo. A stock video company from Calgary named Dissolve briefed And/Or studio to create a beautiful (fake) ad that mocks everything junior creatives (working in advertising) have heard in a studio/boardroom/brainstorm. The tone is cringy, like it was written by a 40-something creative director trying to appeal to millennials. It went viral (what a gross word) because it illustrates perfectly how brands have tried to pander to millennials by using buzzwords such as individuality , diversity , gender . It s a Vimeo Staff Pick. It was also lauded by Ad Age, The Verge and even local clickbait site The Good News Guy. What makes this (fake) ad great? It s a video for a stock video site, using the site s stock footage in a hilarious fashion. It speaks to their target market (ie, agency creatives) in a way that art directors and videographers the world over can relate to. It executes a simple, original concept in a clever way to the right people. It s lovely, isn t it? Then KFC South Africa launched their #HonestlyFLG ( FLG is probably finger licking good ) campaign this week. Here&#8217;s the ad: The ad showcases what looks like stock imagery with chicken animated into almost every shot. It seems clever, funny and semi-entertaining. It&#8217;s well-produced, with clever copy and a great voiceover. What bothered me most is that this video seemed too familiar. KFC speaks to a broad target market in a way their consumers would enjoy, and based on the feedback they&#8217;re receiving for the ad, it&#8217;s a success. However, tonally and visually, it&#8217;s clear that cues were taken from And/Or&#8217;s work. Can we say this ad is inspired by the Generic Millennial Video? Can we say it s derivative? Can we possibly even say KFC s ad is a localised (branded) version of the Generic Millennial Ad? It&#8217;s a slippery slope. Comparing work to earlier work is not fair, because nothing is original. The KFC ad didn&#8217;t copy Dissolve&#8217;s ad frame by frame. The tone is similar, and the nuances (like the parenthesis in the voiceovers) as well. But hey, what do I know? Maybe I&#8217;ve just watched too many ads.
