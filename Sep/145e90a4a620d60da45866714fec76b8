One of the metered taxi industry s biggest complaints about ride-hailing service Uber is that the latter s driver and operators do not have to comply with the same stringent government regulations. Yet it has emerged that, in Gauteng at least, there are more legally operating Uber vehicles than metered taxis. According to Premier David Makhura, there are 2 909 metered taxis on the records of the transport department, only 500 of whom comply with permit requirements. On the other hand, the department has so far received applications for operating licences from 2 321 Uber partner drivers, 624 of which have been approved to date. So, when the metered taxi industry uses supposed flouting of the rules by Uber to take away their business, they are being very economical with the truth. Worse, however, is the fact that an erroneous view of the situation is being used to justify horrific attacks on Uber operators and, in turn, violent reprisals. We are also disturbed by the suggestion by Makhura that outside hitmen some of whom have carried out assassinations in taxi wars or political disputes may be brought into the conflict. Premier, it is your duty to protect those drivers and the rest of us.
