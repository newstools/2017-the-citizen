While we&#8217;re feasting our eyes on some really cool cars at the Frankfurt Motor Show in Germany, some manufacturers have revealed cars that really left our jaws dropping. Some of them might not even find their way to our shores but are really cool to look at&#8230; Mercedes-AMG Project ONE . Dubbed the closest street-legal car to a Formula 1 race car, the Project ONE has been developed by the Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 team. It is powered by a hybrid powertrain that combines the benefits of a turbocharged internal combustion engine and four electric motors. Power is said to be 740kW with a top speed of 350km/h and a claimed 0-200km/h in less than six seconds. Tail-happy Audi R8 V10 RWS . Audi has also revealed its exclusive R8 V10 RWS at the Frankfurt Motor Show. This one is the first AUDI R8 V10 RWS (Rear Wheel Series) which will be joined by the Spyder variant&#8230;soon. Audi says this model will only be limited to 999 units worldwide and it still remains a mystery if it is destined for our market. Power still comes from the naturally aspirated 5.2-litre V10, with power outputs rated at 397kW and 540Nm. That is enough power to send the coupe to 100km/h in 3.7 seconds and 3.8 seconds for the Dropbox. Top speeds come in at 319 km/h and 317 km/h, respectively. Porsche 911 GT3 with Touring Package . Porsche has unveiled the 911 GT3 with Touring Package. This model does not come with the fixed rear wing of the ordinary GT3. Available strictly with a six-speed manual transmision, it does not come cheap. Porsche charges R2 750 500 for this model at our current exchange rate. Porsche says this new variant is aimed at enthusiasts of high-quality sports cars who value an understated appearance and pure driving dynamics . Power comes from the familiar 4.0-litre naturally aspirated engine that powers the 911 GT3, good for 368kW and 460Nm sent to the rear wheels. Porsche says the 911 GT3 with Touring Package can dash from 0-100km/h in 3.9 seconds, before hitting a limiter at 316 km/h.
