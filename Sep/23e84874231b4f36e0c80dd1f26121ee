Former deputy minister of higher education and training Mduduzi Manana was convicted of three counts of assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm by the Randburg Magistrates&#8217; Court on Wednesday. Manana had earlier pleaded guilty to the charges after a public outcry as the video emerged of him allegedly assaulting two women at Cubana nightclub in Fourways last month. He then resigned as deputy minister, but is still a member of parliament. It was alleged that the ANC MP had an altercation with the women after one of them called him &#8220;gay&#8221;. News24 reports that a second suspect who came to court to support the MP on Wednesday was arrested after being pointed out by one of the victims, while Manana&#8217;s case was postponed to November 7 for sentencing. He is currently out on R5 000 bail. A number of students from University of Johannesburg, University of Fort Hare and Tshwane University of Technology protested outside court to support the former deputy minister. News24 reports that the students had placards that read: &#8220;He is remorseful, let us forgive,&#8221; and &#8220;Good leaders know when they are wrong.&#8221; One student told EWN that they were supporting him on the basis that &#8220;we want to walk this path with him&#8221;. &#8220;We don t want to cast him out. Because too many people have been cast out in South Africa, and that s why we re such a violent state. Speak to other men. And be the champion by saying I ve been there, I ve made a mistake. And, let no other men go through that. &nbsp;
