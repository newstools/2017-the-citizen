At first glance, it&#8217;s not immediately apparent why the Force&#8217;s axing from Super Rugby can help the Springboks in Saturday&#8217;s Rugby Championship meeting with the Wallabies in Perth. But former Springboks skipper Jean de Villiers explains it rather neatly. Also read: Allister Coetzee has a surprising confession &#8220;The Wallabies have a lot to prove, their coach and the Australian Rugby Union are both under a bit of pressure,&#8221; he said. &#8220;With the Western Force being kicked out of Super Rugby, the locals might just back the Springboks more. Maybe the Wallabies won t be as well-received in Perth, maybe they won t have quite as much support. That will be a bonus for the Springboks.&#8221; Indeed, the continuing legal saga has brought out the worst in Australian rugby. However, the legendary Springboks midfielder warns his former teammates that they can&#8217;t take that little boost for granted, especially as the attacking ability of the Wallabies will make them dangerous opponents. &#8220;The Wallabies are much better than people think they are and they will obviously be more confident after their last performance against New Zealand,&#8221; said De Villiers. &#8220;It certainly won t be easy, the Wallabies are a dangerous side with lots of x-factor players. Guys like Kurtley Beale, Israel Folau and Will Genia are quality, world-class performers, so the Springboks defence is going to have to function very well. In fact the Springboks can still improve in all areas.&#8221; Instead, the Springboks should rely on their biggest weapon in 2017 to date: a brilliant team culture. In fact, De Villiers believes the transformation in the national rugby team s fortunes this year has been a result of the players playing for each other. &#8220;There s no doubt that the culture of the team has changed drastically. They re not playing for the win or for a trophy, but for each other, a higher purpose if you like, and the wins are the end result of that. They had more time to prepare this year, which is another reason they re better,&#8221; he said. &#8220;South Africa are definitely on an upward curve, they have built up some momentum and they re in a good space. To win with a bonus point in Salta was huge and it will have given them a lot of confidence. But every week is a new week in international rugby and they have to go back to basics and start up front again in Perth.&#8221; &nbsp;
