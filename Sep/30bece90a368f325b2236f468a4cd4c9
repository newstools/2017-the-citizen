Influential Lions lock Franco Mostert hasn&#8217;t been dropped because he&#8217;s slacked off a bit in recent weeks. Springboks coach Allister Coetzee gave that guarantee on Thursday after not including the 26-year-old in the match squad for Saturday&#8217;s Rugby Championship Test against Australia in Perth. Instead, team management are merely looking out for his well-being. &#8220;Franco has played an enormous amount of rugby at Super Rugby level, playing club rugby in Japan and starting all of our Test matches so far this year,&#8221; said Coetzee. &#8220;We have to be sensible in managing the workload of certain players such as Franco. We are fortunate to have a number of very good locks. Pieter-Steph now gets an opportunity to start again. We know what he is capable of.&#8221; Du Toit has indeed shrugged off a lukewarm to his Super Rugby campaign with the Stormers by delivering two storming performances as a replacement against Argentina. The real question is whether Lood de Jager, who squeezes in on the bench, will add value. The Bulls line-out man continues to find form elusive since the 2015 World Cup and hasn&#8217;t played competitive rugby in some while. Coetzee has relied heavily on a dynamic bench in the Springboks&#8217; unbeaten 2017 and surely De Jager will have to pull up his socks. The same can be said of Handre Pollard. His return has been a talking point all week as many have marvelled over his physical condition. But like De Jager, he hasn&#8217;t played in ages. &#8220;I am really satisfied with the way he has trained till now and it s great for the team to have a player of his calibre on the bench,&#8221; said Coetzee. In one other change, the steady Ross Cronje is back to partner Elton Jantjies at halfback. Springboks: Andries Coetzee, Raymond Rhule, Jesse Kriel, Jan Serfontein, Courtnall Skosan, Elton Jantjies, Ross Cronje, Uzair Cassiem, Jaco Kriel, Siya Kolisi, Pieter-Steph du Toit, Eben Etzebeth, Coenie Oosthuizen, Malcolm Marx, Beast Mtawarira. Bench: Bongi Mbonambi, Steven Kitshoff, Trevor Nyakane, Lood de Jager, Jean-Luc du Preez, Francois Hougaard, Handre Pollard, Damian de Allende.
