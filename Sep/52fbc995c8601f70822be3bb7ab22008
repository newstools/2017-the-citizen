A 21-year-old man was killed when a tree stump rolled on top of him at Suncoast Beach in Durban early on Saturday morning, paramedics said. When ER paramedics arrived on the scene at 1.30am the man was found lying underneath the tree stump on the beach, ER24 spokesperson Ineke van Huyssteen said. It is believed that the tree stump was on top of an embankment before it came loose and rolled down on top of the man. Unfortunately, there was nothing they could do for him and he was declared dead on the scene by ER24, she said. African News Agency (ANA)
