The Springboks have, rightly, been complimented for the way they&#8217;ve improved their defence in 2017. Allister Coetzee&#8217;s troops have indeed been unrecognisable from the team that seemed to have no defensive structure in place during last year&#8217;s horror run. Also read: We perhaps don t realise what a big loss Jaco Kriel really is Their statistics in the Rugby Championship to date suggests so too. The Springboks&#8217; tackle completion rate &#8211; their amount of successful tackles &#8211; is 87%, the best in the tournament. They&#8217;ve also made the most dominant tackles (43) to date. It&#8217;s not much of a surprise then that Springboks assistant coach Johann van Graan noted the side will continue to concentrate on their tackling in Saturday&#8217;s Test against the All Blacks in Albany. Not only is it a strength of the Springboks&#8217;, it&#8217;s also a way of evening up a game against the world champions. &#8220;Watching the British and Irish Lions&#8217; series against the All Blacks from at home in South Africa (a few months back), it was a special series,&#8221; said Van Graan. &#8220;It&#8217;s important to learn from other opposition, and mix that with what we are strong with. There were key moments [in the Lions series] that made it a drawn series. We learned one or two things but we will just focus on our defence.&#8221; The Lions were hugely effective in keeping the All Blacks at bay because of an aggressive approach to defence, where they &#8220;rushed&#8221; attackers. But therein lies a problem for the Springboks. And it&#8217;s something former Sharks coach John Plumtree, who&#8217;s now assistant at the Hurricanes, has picked up on. &#8220;I read that (former Springboks coach) Nick Mallett said the Bok defence is too passive and they sit back too much. I agree with that,&#8221; he wrote in a column for SARugbymag. &#8220;If you sit back against the All Blacks attack and allow them to play, they will find a way to break you down eventually. The problem with that defensive system is it allows the opposition to keep the ball for a long period of time.&#8221; The Springboks will have to be in the All Blacks&#8217; faces this weekend yet when they did rush up to the Australians in last weekend&#8217;s draw in Perth, they lost their shape. &#8220;Against the All Blacks, you have to take a few risks defensively and rush them. But that&#8217;s not the Boks&#8217; defensive system and they won&#8217;t be able to change it in a short space of time,&#8221; wrote Plumtree.
