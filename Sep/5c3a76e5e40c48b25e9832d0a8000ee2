A video of a man shaming another at a garage has been doing the rounds on social media. In the video, a man stops his white Golf at a garage to fill it with petrol, but only pours R3.50 worth of petrol. The men at the station cannot believe it, so they take a video of the man to show his face, but he hides in embarrassment. A man in disbelief can be heard saying in Afrikaans: He s throwing petrol in now. Let s see how much he puts in. Jissus, R3.50 s petrol. No, god, man. You re sitting and smiling, you piece of rubbish. (Driver laughs, covers his face) R3.50 s petrol, you re sleg, man. Yassas, my broe. Give the thing his key so he can go. Three rand, fifty cents. There it stands. R3.50 s petrol. Where is this c*nt going with this petrol? Sir, what do you have to say for yourself? No, god, man. Sleg! Watch the video below posted on YouTube by SA Live:
