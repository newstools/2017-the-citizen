A bogus doctor was arrested in Soweto on Tuesday, for allegedly issuing fake medical certificates to motorists applying for public driving permits, the Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) said. Spokesman Simon Zwane said that the woman tried to run away as law enforcement agents from the National Traffic Anti-Corruption Unit, the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (known as the Hawks), the Health Professionals Council of South Africa, the Medicines Control Council and Home Affairs raided her surgery. She was chased through the streets of Soweto and taken to the surgery where medicines, patient files and government documents were seized. The arrest brings to five the number of bogus doctors arrested in Gauteng in four weeks as part of Operation Recall, Zwane said. The doctors are all originally from the Democratic Republic of Congo and use the practice number of a local doctor to conduct their business. Investigations by the Road Traffic Management Corporation have revealed that there are more than 32 000 unlawfully issued public drivers permits. Zwane said the holders of these documents are believed to be on the roads driving buses, trucks and taxis, placing the lives of other road users at risk as they might not be medically fit to be driving vehicles. These documents will be cancelled as soon as investigations have been completed.
