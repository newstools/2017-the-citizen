A video of ANC members in Ekurhuleni singing their own rendition of Zahara&#8217;s hit song, Umthwalo, has left social media users with the impression that the ANC is divided more than ever. The Ekurhuleni mayor, known to be a supporter of President Jacob Zuma, held a regional executive committee with his loyalists at the weekend and endorsed Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma to take over from Zuma in December. News24 has reported the group also endorsed ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe for the position of chairperson in the top six and Paul Mashatile as treasurer-general. Masina&#8217;s detractors were reportedly outvoted as they tried to argue for Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa to take the top job. The news did not sit well with Ramaphosa supporters, and they took to the streets on Monday to express their dissatisfaction. A video shows them singing their rendition of Zahara&#8217;s song and dancing as they turned against their mayor. They were holding placards written: &#8220;You want NDZ17? We Ekurhuleni branches are 100% behind CR17. Period.&#8221; The members have called for an urgent regional general council meeting.

A video emerged of Zuma and the league members singing and dancing in support of Dlamini-Zuma, saying they were ready for her. However, another video of a different faction of the women&#8217;s league emerged at the weekend of them singing the same song as the Dlamini-Zuma faction, but this time they replaced her name with Ramaphosa&#8217;s. Speaking to The Citizen on Monday, the party&#8217;s chief whip, Jackson Mthembu, vowed to ensure that Ramaphosa is elected as the next ANC president at the ANC elective national conference in December. Mthembu said Ramaphosa was their only hope to rescue the ruling party from its current political crisis and to clean the country of corruption. He vowed to defend Ramaphosa against the smear campaign, which he said would boost his standing in December. He was reacting to the weekend report by The Sunday Independent, which alleged Ramaphosa used his wealth to prey on multiple women, including university students.
