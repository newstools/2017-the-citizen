Three Catalan mayors were ordered to appear for questioning Tuesday at provincial offices of public prosecutors, Catalonia&#8217;s Municipal Association for Independence (AMI) said on its website. As of Monday, a total of 37 mayors have received a summons as part of a criminal probe ordered last week by Spain&#8217;s public prosecutor, who has threatened to arrest the more than 700 mayors who support holding the October 1 referendum deemed unconstitutional by Madrid. Faced with a determined Catalan government, Spain has multiplied its efforts to try to block the vote. Spain&#8217;s Guardia Civil police force confiscated 113,000 pro-referendum posters bearing the logo of the Catalan government from a company in Sabadell, a town some 20 kilometres (12 miles) north of Barcelona, the interior ministry said. It brings the total of confiscated pro-referendum pamphlets and posters to 1.5 million since Friday across Catalonia, it added in a statement. In addition, Spain&#8217;s central government on Friday took over the payments of essential services and public workers&#8217; salaries in Catalonia to make sure the region does not use public money on the vote. Catalonia&#8217;s regional government responded on Monday by challenging this measure in Spain&#8217;s Supreme court. Catalonia&#8217;s vice president Oriol Junqueras accused Madrid of seeking to discreetly take away Catalonia&#8217;s autonomy with the measure and vowed it would not stop the referendum from taking place. &#8220;Citizens will vote, there will be ballot boxes and ballots,&#8221; Junqueras said during a meeting with the foreign press in Barcelona. Polls show Catalonia&#8217;s roughly 7.5 million residents are deeply divided on independence. A survey commissioned by the regional government in July showed 49.4 percent of Catalans were against independence while 41.1 percent were in favour.
