In a country like South Africa, the fact that Ottis Gibson is the first black man to coach the Proteas is hugely significant. And to make it just that tad more complicated, he&#8217;s also a foreigner. The implications of that isn&#8217;t something the former West Indian fast bowler is oblivious to. Also read: Ottis Gibson already has a problem: a crippling bowler shortage &#8220;The first black coach to coach South Africa, that sounds like a lot of pressure,&#8221; Gibson said at his official unveiling on Tuesday. &#8220;The first foreign coach since Bob Woolmer sounds like a lot of pressure too because I was playing cricket in the 90s when Bob Woolmer was doing great things. He was an innovator and had a very good team.&#8221; But Gibson, who played six years in South Africa with three different provincial teams, doesn&#8217;t want to be considered a foreigner. For at least the next 18 months, he&#8217;s a South African and even watched the Springboks&#8217; horror show against the All Blacks last weekend to &#8220;share in everyone&#8217;s pain&#8221;. However, it&#8217;s unlikely that the 48-year-old will sidestep continued debates over race and politics that comes with his new job. &#8220;That process (transformation and targets) has been happening before I got here. There s no need for me to go into that because it s happening already as far as selection is concerned. We will continue on the path that we are. It seems that the chairman of selectors (Linda Zondi) has got a handle on that, so there s no need for me to go into that,&#8221; said Gibson. The Proteas mentor&#8217;s contribution to transformation doesn&#8217;t end with the players though as there&#8217;s an expectation that he&#8217;ll make local black coaches part of his support staff. Geoff Toyana and Mali Maketa, coaches of the Highveld Lions and Warriors respectively, have been mentioned as possible deputies. &#8220;I m very much aware of the transformation issues, and certainly when it comes to picking support staff that will be a part of it,&#8221; said Gibson. &#8220;I ve been given the backing of CSA to pick what I consider to be the best people to take the team where I want to take it and to work with me. Over the course of the next five or six weeks, when I speak to coaches I m going to try and get the best people for the jobs that I want them to do.&#8221; For now though, Gibson will rely on the support staff of Russell Domingo, the man he replaces, to help him in the series against Bangladesh. &#8220;Cricket is not like football where the manager gets fired and the next person that comes in brings a whole new support staff. What I ve decided along with CSA is to keep the people in place for the moment, and that will give me time to assess them and see what else is out there.&#8221;
