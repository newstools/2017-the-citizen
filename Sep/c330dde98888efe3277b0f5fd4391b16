One thing you can say about tomorrow s Springboks vs All Blacks battle is that, whatever has happened before, counts for nothing especially for the South Africans. The Boks have not lost a match in their last six encounters, which is not something to be sneezed at. It is also true that the team came desperately close to a win against the Wallabies last weekend, after the Australians themselves gave the much-vaunted New Zealanders one of the frights of their rugby lives. The All Blacks, though, relish defeating the Springboks and they have had plenty of practice at that. The match, in Albany, just outside Auckland, will see the Boks tackling one of the most difficult away matches in any sport. Yet, there is plenty of room for optimism, too, for local fans. This Bok team is still a work in progress and things get better all the time. There is a satisfying blend of experience and youthful exuberance and the team s defensive game, while still not perfect, has improved markedly. Most of all, though, our boys are not cowed or intimidated by the best team in world rugby. Sometimes, an attitude can win you matches.
