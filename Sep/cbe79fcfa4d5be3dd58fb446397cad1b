Bafana Bafana can t afford to drop any more points when they face Cape Verde in a World Cup qualifier at Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban tonight. Four points from three matches is just not good enough, especially after losing to bottom-ofthe-group Cape Verde in Praia on Friday. Another below-par performance against the Blue Sharks tonight would put huge pressure on them if they are to qualify for next year s World Cup in Russia. Ignoring the 2010 World Cup, where they automatically qualified as hosts, South Africa have not qualified for the World Cup since 2002. Stuart Baxter s men were handed a big favour when Senegal and Burkina Faso played to a goalless draw at the weekend, which means that all four nations are within touching distance. Burkina Faso lead the group with five points, ahead of Senegal and South Africa on four points, while Cape Verde are at the bottom with a point less. Baxter has hinted he will make wholesale changes for tonight s match. He needs to find his winning combination and find it fast. Bafana will host Burkina Faso next month, while they ll conclude their qualifying campaign with a tricky trip against Senegal in Dakar in November. But those qualifiers won t mean much if Bafana can t find a way past Cape Verde tonight.
