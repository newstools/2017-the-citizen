This son of July winner Bold Silvano won over this 1400m less than two months ago, and the race has panned out well, with five subsequent winners finishing behind him that day. In addition both of his recent victories have been in stronger company than the MR 62 field he meets here, and despite now carrying top weight remains a confident selection. The battle hardened campaigner Devious Tiger has been in great form of late, and makes most appeal of the balance. Another potential danger is the three-year-old Oratio, who scored a very easy win last Monday, but has extremely in and out form overall. The same could be said of fellow Stephanie Miller youngster Domitian. He has alternated good and poor efforts so far in a short career, and if in the mood could be a threat from the best draw. Flamingo would not be Flamingo without a surprise or two, and a resurgent Il Palio could be the source of a minor upset in Race 5, a not particularly strong looking Pinnacle Stakes over 1800m. Now a seven-year-old, his merit rating has been dropping steadily and he signalled a return to form with a good second to Manouche a week ago. His last two wins were both over this trip, with the last coming virtually a year to the day ago, and he should be thereabouts in an open contest. Another who makes strong appeal is Tall Mo in the first. If bringing anything like his best Cape form to the sand he will take a power of beating. At the time of writing no jockey had been declared as a dispute existed due to the double booking of Francois Herholdt on both Tall Mo and Bletchley. Would you like to place a bet on the horses?
