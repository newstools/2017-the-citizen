The HQ is located in central Mali at Sevare, about 10 kilometres (six miles) east of Mopti, in a region that has been hit by a wave of terror attacks in recent months. The five-battalion, 5,000-strong force, decided at a summit in Bamako on July 2, is to comprise troops from Niger, Chad, Mali, Mauritania and Burkina Faso. It has an annual budget of about $496 million (423 million euros) a year, although so far only about $127 million (108 million euros) has been pledged. The participating countries rank among the poorest nations in the world. A plan seen by AFP Saturday calls for the first battalion to be operational this month, and in October &#8220;cross-border operations will take place in the tri-frontier zone&#8221; shared by Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso. France, which has 4,000 troops serving across the Sahel region with a counter-terror mandate, is a major backer of the initiative. French President Emmanuel Macron has been pitching for support from other European nations, especially Germany.
