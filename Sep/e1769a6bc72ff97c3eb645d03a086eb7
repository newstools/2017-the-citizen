It has only just begun. And by it they mean the local rolling out of Haval products. Haval, of course, is not just the luxury subbrand of GWM, but the biggest mover of SUVs in China with over one-million sold last year. . Haval also comprehensively rewrites everything you might have thought about Chinese vehicles. And now with the local unveiling of the Haval H6 C, they expect that both the market and the media are going to adore this machine just as much as they do the previously launched H2. It&#8217;s a sleek SUV, with the C standing for Coupe while its heartbeat comes courtesy of a high-tech, four-cylinder, turbopetrol, 2.0-litre mill. And with 140kW and 310Nm of torque between 2000 and 3600rpm on tap, progress is brisk, with the 0-100km/h coming up in nine seconds, it is claimed. Power is to the front wheels via a slick six-speed automatic (DCT) or six-speed manual box, while 4WD versions are available on special order. . And yes like the smaller H2, the H6 C boasts a fivestar C NCAP rating. The H6 C is available in three trim levels: City, Premium, and Luxury. And helping that five-star rating along is the fact that all derivatives, bar City-spec vehicles, have six airbags. Standard across the entire range, meanwhile, is the likes of ESP (electronic stability programme), hill ascent and descent control, adjustable front seatbelts with pre-tensioners, reverse camera and child locks. All models get the likes of dual-zone climate control, electric foldable side mirrors with demister, keyless entry, satellite controls on the steering wheel and automatic headlights and wipers. There s also a top-notch sound system with Luxury models in boasting concert-hall sound. All but entry-level City models get an eight-way, electrically adjustable driver s seat (and all seats are of synthetic leather, except the City s), while Luxury derivatives have a panoramic sunroof and xenon headlights as standard. . The Haval H6 C, like the Haval H2, is backed by a five-year/100 000km warranty, a five-year/60 000km service plan, and a fiveyear/unlimited km roadside assistance.
