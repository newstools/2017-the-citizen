A video of church members in their blue uniform singing De Mogul SA&#8217;s hit song &#8216;O e batla kae&#8217; in church has gone viral. The video shows men, young and old, singing and dancing to the song: &#8220;O e batla kae? Ko mokokotlong,&#8221; which translates to: &#8220;Where do you want it? On the back.&#8220; It looks like church was out or gone to a break when the men decided to have fun with the song. Social media users had a lot to say about it, with some saying the country needed a lot of prayers if songs such as this one were being sung in churches.
