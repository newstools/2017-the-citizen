When the Springboks announced on Tuesday that Jaco Kriel is &#8211; to all intents and purposes &#8211; out for the rest of the Rugby Championship with a shoulder injury, you could immediately hear opinion being divided. The Lions star is undoubtedly a popular player among South African fans in general. Also read: Allister Coetzee: Cheery Springboks need to be realistic He&#8217;s skillful, dynamic and hard-working. Many will say he&#8217;s a big loss to the Springboks but there&#8217;s also a fair amount of observers who&#8217;ll express sympathy without getting stressed. South African rugby still loves a proverbial &#8220;Hulk&#8221; of a player, the bulldozer generally swats an opponent aside. Jean-Luc du Preez, the man most likely to replace Kriel against the All Blacks on Saturday, is that guy. He&#8217;s a 1.94m, 112 kg monster of a man. And he&#8217;s a brilliant replacement for Kriel. The 22-year-old arguably will bring more balance to the Springboks&#8217; loose trio because he&#8217;s an out-and-out blindside flanker. He&#8217;s going to win collisions against the All Blacks defenders and he&#8217;s going to tackle well. Du Preez&#8217;s elevation is not the issue here. The problem is the risk that we don&#8217;t realise the magnitude of the Springboks losing Jaco Kriel. We know it&#8217;s big but it&#8217;s actually huge. Kriel is 1.84m tall and weighs 100 kg. The two frontline centres &#8211; Jan Serfontein and Jesse Kriel &#8211; are taller than him. Springboks coach Allister Coetzee has picked him as a blindside flanker, a position normally reserved for giants like Du Preez. It&#8217;s also one where a player can&#8217;t play with as much freedom as he&#8217;s afforded at the Lions, especially at international level. In other words, Kriel has been selected in a position he&#8217;s theoretically not suited for. What his stats suggest though is a man who&#8217;s rubbished conventional wisdom. Kriel has made the most tackles in the Rugby Championship to date &#8211; 39. Du Preez&#8217;s 17 is also impressive considering he&#8217;s been used as a replacement. However, one needs to realise that tackles can&#8217;t be measured equally. Four of Kriel&#8217;s tackles have been dominant, meaning ball-carriers were overwhelming by his &#8220;hit&#8221; when they carried the ball. That&#8217;s the third most in the tournament. Du Preez, despite being taller and heavier, hasn&#8217;t made a single dominant hit. Kriel, despite playing when defences are far more tighter, has broken the same amount of tackles as Du Preez. He&#8217;s won three turnovers &#8211; the most in the tournament &#8211; and even won a line-out. In this instance, the stats don&#8217;t quite lie: Kriel has played like a seasoned blindsider. And he&#8217;s going to be missed &#8230; hugely.
